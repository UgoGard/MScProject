2024-04-22 14:09:00+00:00,Bitcoin Miners Profit $107 Million From Runes Minting Activity,https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/bitcoin-miners-profit-million-runes-minting/,"In the lead up to the fourth Bitcoin (BTC) Halving event, a great deal of the ‘price action’ discussion centered around how this cycle would affect Bitcoin miners. Though, despite concerns over mining profitability, BTC token supply, and a “pending” sell-off from miners, it appears as though the fourth Bitcoin Halving event has been very profitable for them. That is, however, thanks to Runes minting. According to on-chain data, Bitcoin miners raked in a record $107.7 million on the day of the fourth Bitcoin Halving, April 20, 2024. On halving day, #Bitcoin  mining revenue soared to a record $107.7M. The 840,000th block included 3,050 txs with an average fee of nearly $800, totaling $2.4M in fees alone. However, the $BTC  transaction fees have fallen to an average of $8–$10 for medium-priority transactions pic.twitter.com/YYohoGjDZh  — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) April 22, 2024   But according to data from Glassnode , the launch of Runes on the same day and the subsequent flurry of minting activity of minting that followed, over 75% of this revenue came from network transaction fees. According to glassnode, affected by the Runes minting activity, on April 20, Bitcoin miner revenue reached US$106.7 million, of which 75.444% came from network transaction fees, both reaching record highs. https://t.co/lVSyqn1UaE  pic.twitter.com/xjkkTor2I9  — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 21, 2024   Runes are the latest Bitcoin innovation from Ordinals creator, Casey Rodarmor. He set out to improve on his creation with a more efficient means of creating tokens on the Bitcoin network. As we previously reported, Bitcoin Ordinals are essentially Bitcoin-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Though a briefly popular innovation, it drew ire from observers who were quick to note the congestion and increased fees caused by issues in the protocol’s design. Runes were built for degens and memecoins, but the protocol is simple, efficient, and secure. It is a legitimate competitor to Taproot Assets and RGB.

Balances are… — Casey (@rodarmor) April 1, 2024   In short, Runes is a protocol that allows users to create new tokens and mint them directly onto Bitcoin. The creator can buy, sell, trade and use them however they see fit. This could see something akin to the initial coin offering (ICO) boom occur on Bitcoin as the Runes ecosystem develops. Every halving, Bitcoin miners have to make some difficult decisions. If they wish to remain competitive in the wake of a significant earnings slash, they need to sell their accumulated BTC tokens and resupply on more, or newer hardware. If they decide to simply cash in and shut down their operations, it can also result in small reductions in the network’s hashing power, which isn’t ideal for the network. However, Runes and other Bitcoin-centric innovations could give miners an additional and consistent stream of revenue. #Bitcoin  Miner pre-halving block reward: 6.25 + some small fees = ~6.5-7 BTC per block Bitcoin post-halving reward (w/ ordinals and runes): 3.125 + larger fees from demand for block space = 7+ on average so far So total block subsidies for miners post-halving look to be higher… — 300DollarMARA (@dollar_mara) April 20, 2024   The initial hype from the Runes launch has now seemingly died down  with mining revenue dropping from its peak. However, Runes could signal a renewed interest in the Bitcoin network. Ultimately, this could be a positive sign of things to come for the sustainability of the Bitcoin network. Our revenue from bitcoin mining last 48 hours @QntmExpeditions . The initial fee spike has already completely subsided and we're now firmly below pre-halving rewards. Time to tighten the belt ladies and gents, these rune-heads aren't gonna prop-up shit. $Mara  $CLSK  $RIOT  pic.twitter.com/FDvGxVb1Oq  — Mati (@MatiGreenspan) April 21, 2024   While it unknown how successful Runes, Ordinals, or other Bitcoin-centric innovations will be, miners may have found a fresh source of motivation to secure the network with whatever hardware they have.  "

They plan to organize a referendum  to amend the national constitution to achieve this goal. First, however, they must gather over 100,000 signatures from local citizens to move forward with the petition.

He said : “We are in the process of completing the organizational preparations for the committee and preparing the documents that must be submitted to the State Chancellery in order to start the process.” 2B4CH did not immediately respond to a request for comment. For a referendum to proceed on amending the Swiss constitution, 100,000 signatures from Swiss nationals are required within 18 months. 2B4CH was unable to overcome this hurdle during its initial attempt in October 2021. 🇨🇭We are planning to start a Federal Popular Initiative.

Then, he will have three minutes to advocate for the inclusion of Bitcoin on the Swiss National Bank’s balance sheet . This is not Meisser’s first attempt to influence the central bank’s cryptocurrency strategy. He previously proposed that the bank purchase 1 billion Swiss francs (about $1.1 billion) worth of Bitcoin monthly as an alternative to German government bonds in March 2022. However, the Swiss National Bank’s Chair, Thomas Jordan , expressed skepticism about Bitcoin’s suitability as a reserve currency. He said Bitcoin did not meet the necessary criteria for inclusion in the bank’s reserves. Meisser has recently argued that if the Swiss National Bank had followed his advice to purchase Bitcoin in 2022, Switzerland could have gained an additional 30 billion Swiss francs ($32.9 billion). He warns delays could result in higher costs later, as other central banks might acquire Bitcoin, potentially driving up prices. On the other hand, Leon Curti from Digital Asset Solutions sees promise  in the recent approvals of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States and Hong Kong.

Key Takeaways
 On Sunday, the average transaction fee for Bitcoin decreased  after reaching an all-time high the previous day, following the network’s fourth halving. The average fee per Bitcoin transaction fell  to $34.80 on April 21, down from a record $128.45 after the halving. However, the spike in fees could, potentially, have caused people to look to other blockchains. The average transaction fee is the total transaction fees collected divided by the number of transactions processed. For instance, after the recent Bitcoin halving event, the average transaction fee spiked because of increased network activity. Once the activity leveled off, the price went down and stabilized. On April 20, 2024, the fees surged  to a high due to a significant increase in network usage. This coincided with new blockchain innovations like the Runes protocol​​. After the halving, the average transaction fee was recorded at $128.45 on the day of the event and then dropped to $34.86 the following day, showcasing a significant reduction as the initial rush settled down​​. This dynamic change in fees is indicative of how Bitcoin fees can be influenced by network congestion and major events such as halvings or protocol launches​​. Transaction fees collected by #Bitcoin  miners yesterday tripled the previous all-time high, coming in at over $78,000,000. We also made a new record streak of 104 blocks in which fees exceeded newly created BTC! pic.twitter.com/WZkCQ8dbr3  — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) April 21, 2024   To manually calculate transaction fees, one needs to know the average fee rate, which is expressed in satoshis per byte. This fee is essential for transactions to be processed by miners on the network. Users can pay a higher fee for quicker confirmation or a lower fee if the transaction is not time-sensitive​​. The hashprice index,  a metric developed by Luxor to measure the earnings a miner can expect from a given amount of hashrate, declined from $182.98 per hash/day to $81, falling below pre-halving levels. Bitcoin miners braced for a significant reduction in revenue due to the halving. Meanwhile, the launch of Casey Rodarmor’s Runes protocol — aimed at creating fungible tokens on Bitcoin — was supposed to counteract this by generating increased on-chain activity. The average fee per transaction on $BTC  has spiked to $128 This is 2.9x the last ATH in 2021 and can be attributed to ""Runes"" going live on the halving block ""Runes"" is a token protocol on BTC like ERC20 on ETH How long will this last? pic.twitter.com/A0tXDNSTvE  — Dom (@traderview2) April 21, 2024   If you want to understand the fundamental business model of a public blockchain, you need to observe its financial operations in terms of revenues and costs. Public blockchains generate revenue primarily through transaction fees. Their primary expense is the cost of securing the network, usually done through rewards or issuance to miners or validators. The following formula expresses the relationship. Net Profit = Transaction Fees – Security Costs This formula allows one to evaluate the financial health of blockchain operations. A blockchain that incurs higher costs for security than it earns in transaction fees operates at a deficit, indicating a potential sustainability issue. Conversely, if transaction fees exceed the cost of security, the blockchain is financially sustainable. 1/ L1 econ Every layer 1 chain needs to be defended. This costs money. You pay for the defense in two ways.  1) Inflate your money supply2) Tax blockspace sales If your inflation costs exceed your tax revenue you're operating at a deficit. A deficit is not sustainable. — RYAN SΞAN ADAMS – rsa.eth 🦄 (@RyanSAdams) January 20, 2022   Ethereum’s transaction fees are based on “gas,” which powers computations and transactions. Before August 2021, a first-price auction set the fees. The EIP-1559 update introduced a new model where fees are calculated by multiplying the gas limit by the base fee (minimum price per gas unit, adjusted by demand) plus a tip (priority fee). The base fee is burned, removing it from circulation. The major change in Dencun is the introduction of Proto-Danksharding. EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding) introduces a new transaction type known as ‘blob-carrying transactions’. It lowers transaction costs for both L2 users, and increases Ethereum's transaction throughput. pic.twitter.com/mTzL9eoJRk  — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) February 21, 2024   Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a derivative of Bitcoin (BTC), created through a hard fork. with the goal of enhancing the cryptocurrency’s functionality as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. One of the primary distinctions between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin is their fee structure. BCH is designed to maintain very low transaction fees, typically less than a penny, which contrasts with Bitcoin’s median transaction fee, which has generally ranged from $1 to $15 since 2020. Bitcoin Cash’s transaction fees are lower because of its block size. BCH has a maximum block size of 32 MB, compared to Bitcoin’s 1 MB. This larger block size allows Bitcoin Cash to process a higher volume of transactions per block. 🟢 Bitcoin Cash Undergoes Halving Event, Sets Stage for May Upgrade The latest block data reveals that the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network has undergone its anticipated reward-halving event. Consequently, BCH miners are now rewarded with half the amount they previously earned before… pic.twitter.com/tjz5ZsDAEB  — DefiLabs (@defilabs_farm) April 11, 2024   Litecoin (LTC)‘s fee structure designed to be more user-friendly than Bitcoin. The Litecoin network prioritizes transactions based on a metric called “coin days destroyed”. This is calculated by multiplying the number of coins in a transaction by the number of days those coins have been held, then dividing by the transaction size in bytes. Transactions exceeding a certain priority level can be processed without any fees. A nominal fee comes into effect for transactions that do not meet this priority threshold. Currently, the fee is 0.001 LTC per kilobyte of transaction data. However, there are plans to reduce this to 0.0001 LTC per kilobyte in the upcoming software update. Dogecoin has updated its fee structure to reduce the cost of transactions and motivate node operators to forward transactions with lower fees to miners. This new pricing model has come in via several software updates. Key changes include a substantial reduction in the minimal relay fee from 1 DOGE down to 0.001 DOGE and a lowering of the dust limit to 0.01 DOGE to promote microtransactions. Additionally, there is a default fee rate of 0.01 DOGE for block inclusion. This encourages miners to prioritize transactions in the earliest possible blocks, while also helping to deter spam transactions. Solana’s fee system includes a base fee and a per-signature fee. The base fee, set at 5000 lamports (equivalent to 0.00005 SOL), covers storage costs for each transaction. Additionally, a per-signature fee, based on the number of signatures in a transaction, applies. This is the number of signatures multiplied by the prevailing fee rate. This rate varies with network congestion and users can monitor it with the Solana Command Line Interface (CLI) or the Solana JSON-RPC API. Since fees between @solana  and @0xPolygon  are doing the rounds, here's some food for thought. Solana was cheaper than Polygon till 2023. And by a lot. For instance: In 2022 and 2023 (on some days) one could do 38 transactions on Solana at the same cost as a single transaction… pic.twitter.com/ah6Rcurtoa  — PYOR | Power Your Own Research (@pyorxyz) February 25, 2024   Polygon’s fee structure incorporates two primary components: the StdTx and the Bor Fee Model. The StdTx, part of the Heimdall layer, allows developers to build blockchain applications on Polygon without incurring transaction fees for every operation. This system supports only a limited range of transaction types. For instance, end users are not able to deploy contracts on Heimdall, reinforcing the fixed fee model used in StdTx. However, in the days following the halving, the market response has been less favorable than anticipated. The floor prices for the runestone NFT collection have plummeted  nearly 50% in the last 24 hours to about 0.037 BTC. Conversely, ordinal collections such as Bitcoin Pullets and NodeMonkes have experienced gains , rising 11% and 8% respectively. It’s important to note that while these ordinal collections do generate significant transaction fees, they haven’t proven to be the robust revenue source many had hoped Runes would be."

Key Takeaways
 After nearly a week of trading downward, the price of Bitcoin has rebounded by around 8%. This upward move came after it dropped to a monthly low of $59,700 in the early hours of April 19. Political tension in the Middle East is higher than it has been for years amid tit-for-tat missile volleys between Israel and Iran. Therefore, financial markets are experiencing high volatility. But for Bitcoin, the the cryptocurrency’s looming halving further compnounds the macroeconomic background. At the time of writing the Bitcoin blockchain stood at a height of 839,919 blocks. This is less than 1,000 blocks shy of the 840,000 block juncture at which mining rewards will cut in half. The crucial moment should now occur shortly before midnight (UTC) today, April 19 2024. Previous halvings have been characterized by a short, sharp price spike at the moment of occurrence. But these have typically been corrected within an hour or two.   The halving is only 13 hours away! Here is the best Runes countdown clock to watch:#Bitcoin  pic.twitter.com/iT8GaFmJkt  — BitFS.io (@BitFStore) April 19, 2024   Market sentiment going into the halving is also very different this time around, when the pre-halving rally fizzled out more than a month before the event itself. As for the days and weeks ahead, in the past, volatility around the halving was short-lived and followed by a more prolonged period of sideways trading. But the current macroeconomic and geopolitical climate suggests there could more more choppy waters ahead. Commenting on the events of the past week, Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex observed that the sentiment surrounding Bitcoin’s upcoming halving “was notably optimistic until a week ago, with many expecting a significant price surge.”  However, “with last weekend’s de-leveraging event, following the launch of missiles and drones towards Israel from Iran,” he noted that “sentiment has taken a turn for the worse.”  With the conflict facing further escalation, he said: “It remains to be seen if this will affect fundamentals but sentiment is decidedly more cautious now.” Tensions between Israel and Iran appear to have cast a cloud of uncertainty over financial markets. However, major Bitcoin miners are banking on the cryptocurrency’s price rising above $80,000 once the anticipated post-halving bull run kicks in. That represents double the current average cost of mining one Bitcoin using an Antminer S19 XP, a popular industrial mining unit used by firms like Marathon Digital. #Bitcoin  Unrealized Profits for On-Chain Cohorts: Old whales: +223%New whales (TradFi/ETFs): +1.6%Small miners: +131%Big miners (Mining companies): +81% Not enough profit to end this cycle, imo. pic.twitter.com/yehpa5YFSo  — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) April 19, 2024   To keep their operations ticking until mining becomes profitable again, Marathon, Riot and other large Bitcoin miners have stockpiled BTC worth $2.8 billion. Many miners are currently sitting on unrealized profits from March. Recent bearishness may have cut into these profits, but it has not completely wiped them out. But companies can’t hold on to their reserves for too long without the reduced cash flow introducing operational risk. The biggest players are almost certainly prepared to weather a few months of flat or negative BTC price growth. But if, for any reason, the current cycle breaks with historical trends and the halving doesn’t catalyze a major rally within nine months, their entire business model could be in jeopardy. "

Key Takeaways
 After a UK court ruled once and for all that Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto, lawsuits he has filed that rest on his claim to have invented Bitcoin are all but certain to fail.  With his claim now discredited as far as UK law goes, Wright’s holding company, Tulip Trading, has now abandoned  a lawsuit against 12 Bitcoin developers that sought to make them liable for BTC Wright claims was stolen from him. In the lawsuit, Tulip Trading argued a group of developers who had worked on various software projects relating to Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Cash, BSV and Bitcoin ABC, had a fiduciary responsibility to help Wright recover the allegedly stolen cryptocurrency.  Essentially, Wright wanted the developers to rewrite their client code to assert Tulip Trading as the owner of the crypto in question.  Craig Wright has discontinued his claims against Bitcoin developers (incl me) in the TTL case (where he was asking for a fork of bitcoin that seized random coins and gave him free money)!https://t.co/bSoJIN6Xbb  — Matt Corallo (@TheBlueMatt) April 16, 2024   On the surface, Wright’s claim seems reasonable. The vast majority of Bitcoin nodes run the latest version of Bitcoin Core. Surely that means the Core developers exercise enough control over the network to be liable to the claims of BTC owners? But that argument ignores the practical politics of decentralization. Just because most nodes do run the same client, doesn’t mean they have to. Bitcoin Core and the other pieces of software named by the Tulip Trading Company are all open-source. They evolve through consensus and debate. Therefore, anyone can contribute to the codebase, alter it or reject upgrades they don’t like.  The mere existence of Bitcoin Cash and BSV shows that no single party can force their views on the network. Disagreements over design can and do occur. If one entity controlled Bitcoin, there would never be any forks. Numerous versions of blockchain software exist and different communities use them. What determines their importance is not who wrote the software they use, but the size and influence of the community using compatible protocols.  With the Tulip Trading Company lawsuit now dashed, the affected developers can breathe a sigh of relief.  But it is a bit of a shame that courts never got to settle a question that could be just as important, if not more so, as “who invented Bitcoin?”. Going forward, Wright may well abandon other legal battles in the UK in which his chances of victory are slim-to-nothing after the Satoshi case. “One fact above all is true about cryptocurrency and digital assets, and that fact is this: Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto.” – @iampaulgrewal  on ABC News pic.twitter.com/6E3Fqtu8JV  — hodlonaut 80 IQ 10%er 🌮⚡🔑 🐝 (@hodlonaut) March 28, 2024   That’s good news for the likes of Coinbase and Kraken. But the possibility remains someone else could come along and reopen the Bitcoin copyright can of worms. The question of whether the Bitcoin whitepaper can be copyrighted in the UK, even by the real Satoshi, remains unanswered.  In his initial judgment in the case of Wright vs the Crypto Open Patent Alliance, Justice James Mellor ruled Craig Wright wasn’t the author. While the final verdict is still unreleased, he could potentially lay the matter to rest by issuing a more expansive ruling that places it in the public domain for good."

Key Takeaways
 The price of Bitcoin has fallen by around 15% since April 8, but more losses could be on the horizon as the short-term outlook remains bearish. Still the largest known Bitcoin holder despite its stockpile of coins dwindling by 50% since converting to an ETF, Grayscale’s GBTC has been especially affected by the recent correction.  Meanwhile, anticipation is building ahead of the Bitcoin halving, set  to take place by April 20, even if the outlook for GBTC is not exactly rosy.   At the time Grayscale converted its Bitcoin Trust to an ETF earlier this year, GBTC held around 619,220 BTC. As of April 18, that number had been slashed in half to just 308,594 BTC. With GBTC having witnessed net outflows every single day since its conversion, just $2 billion now separates it from the second-largest Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Collectively, 11 US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced net outflows of around $260 million so far this week as plummeting crypto prices prompt investors to pull their funds. However, IBIT has managed to buck the wider trend, sustaining positive asset flows despite the difficult market conditions. Although BlackRock only reports the dollar value of its holdings, a rough calculation based on the BTC price at the time markets closed on Wednesday suggests the firm currently holds around 271,000 Bitcoins. However, with all other Bitcoin ETFs struggling amid ongoing bearishness, IBIT may soon experience outflows too. With the Bitcoin halving set to occur by Saturday, April 20, most medium-term forecasts predict the price of Bitcoin rising before the end of the year. But before then, the current bear run must first run its course. During previous halvings, price volatility around the time of the event has seen BTC decline in value by up to 20% from its pre-halving peak. #Bitcoin  Might Trade Sideways for 6 months As Miners Could Sell $5bn of BTC -> Here is why: https://t.co/gLRgs8yyGg  pic.twitter.com/zBLdV95MAl  — 10x Research (@10x_Research) April 13, 2024   If that pattern plays out this time around, Bitcoin could keep sliding to as low as $56,000 before the market levels out. In light of the decreased Bitcoin supply post-halving, analysts anticipate miners liquidating billions of dollars of hoarded BTC in the coming months to make up for the reduction in block rewards. This could delay any upward price movement for months."

With the intent of bringing greater flexibility, innovation, and solutions such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to the Bitcoin blockchain, Runes could be the ‘next big thing’ for crypto, or just another tech bubble. Amid a memecoin frenzy, Rodamor took to social media on April 1, 2024, to announce Runes. Which could have easily been perceived as nothing more than a classic April Fool’s joke. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your perspective, the post was legitimate. Runes were built for degens and memecoins, but the protocol is simple, efficient, and secure.

As per a blog post outlining the intent of Runes, Rodamor notes that Ordinals have “undesirable consequences of Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) proliferation” on Bitcoin. This surplus “junk” left over clogs up the network, resulting in higher transaction fees and network congestion. Now, the process of creating Runes, or “etching”, allows users to create governance rules and unchangeable attributes within the Rune.

Runes can either have an open or closed minting process. Open minting on a Rune lets anyone who meets pre-determined conditions to create new tokens. Closed minting only allows for the creation under certain parameters such as block height or token threshold. Once minted, a Rune is transferred from a transaction input to output using an instruction called “edict”. In short, this is a message that determines how a rune should be transferred, allowing users to make batch transfers, airdrops, and other features. The success of Ordinals saw miners rake in some $256 million in revenue through transaction fees. But again, Ordinals were seemingly a novelty lacking any practicality, and were a good, but not perfect, attempt to reinvigorate the Bitcoin network. As stated on a February episode  of his podcast, Hell Money, Rodamor says: “I’m creating a venue for people to create shitcoins,” Runes intends to achieve the same, although with a significantly smaller on-chain footprint, one that is sustainable and can actually result in the creation of new utility tokens on Bitcoin. In a September 2023 blog post  on Runes, Rodamor admitted: “I’m not sure creating a new fungible token protocol for Bitcoin is a good idea. Fungible tokens are 99.9% scams and memes” He also notes that creating a good protocol that can function as the foundation for brilliant projects could “bring significant transaction fee revenue, developer mindshare, and users to Bitcoin”. While it might not happen overnight, or even this year, Runes could, potentially, push the envelope just a little further into unknown territories. With the Bitcoin Halving just days away, discussions of supply shock, and major sell-offs amongst miners, Runes may rejuvenate optimism around the future of the Bitcoin network."
2024-04-17 11:58:00+00:00,"Bitcoin Halving Sparks Fears of Miner Cash Out and Price Impact, But Could Reinvigorate PoW",https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/bitcoin-halving-miners-cash-pow-hope/,"With the Bitcoin Halving set to take place in a matter of days, anticipation is mounting across the market to see if this cycle will initiate yet another bull run, but it seems as though miners are yet to make their play. The interplay of BTC’s price, the network’s hash rate, and the efficiency of mining operations determines the direction of the market. It seems this cycle is playing out very differently compared to previous halvings. Also, the change in how Bitcoin rewards miners could have an impact on the entire concept of a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. Halving events can put a strain on mining operations, historically requiring them to sell accumulated Bitcoin (BTC) tokens and upgrade their equipment to maintain competitiveness in the face of a significant slash to their potential earnings. According to a Bloomberg report , Bitcoin miners could lose up to $10 billion in revenue this time around. This is because the 900 BTC awarded daily will shrink to 450 BTC. We must, however, point out that this projection is based on the current price of BTC. BREAKING 🚨: Bitcoin Miners This week's $BTC  halving could result in Bitcoin miners sustaining annual losses of up to $10 billion pic.twitter.com/s9RbbdnFPj  — Barchart (@Barchart) April 16, 2024   Naturally, losses could be mitigated if there is a price rally. The problem is that there has already been a rally, spurred by 200,000  BTC tokens purchased between the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval decision on January 11 and the end of March. Historically, miners sell their BTC to recover from the impact of the block reward being halved in the bull run that follows. But it seems US-based mining farms are accumulating and holding their stashes now. Meanwhile, smaller operations may already be exiting mining pools. Hashrate down over 20%.

It is perhaps this fact alone that is shaping the dynamics of the most anticipated event in crypto. A miner wallet woke up after being dormant for nearly 14 years and deposited 50 $BTC ($3.28M) to #Coinbase  5 mins ago.

Again, we could make the argument that that this halving cycle is occurring in a markedly different landscape. Furthermore, miners had an easier time adjusting to the earnings slash as the bull runs that followed the 2012, 2016, and 2020 halvings saw the price of BTC multiply significantly, leaping around 93, 30, and 8 times, respectively. #Bitcoin  price history with halvings market ⤵️And tou ? What do you expect from this #BitcoinHalving2024  ??🤔 pic.twitter.com/f0myFnaib0  — Anonymus Crypto (@AnonymusCrpyto) April 13, 2024   As we have seen this year, past performance isn’t an indicator of future returns. Indeed, it seems that this year’s bull cycle was kickstarted a little earlier than investors may have wanted, thanks to demand for spot BTC ETFs outpacing mining production. As we recently discussed, the pending supply shock that is likely to occur as the block reward is cut from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC could be more significant than previous cycles, which isn’t entirely a bad thing. A supply shock in Bitcoin markets can result in rapid price movements and attract fresh capital from investors. However, without any major liquidations from miners, BTC could continue to hover around the $60,000-$70,000 price mark for months to come. This is by no means bad news and may be healthy for the market. It is, however, unlikely we will see any major multipliers in price like we have done before. But even if it only doubles, or triples in price, that’s a lot of money. Major players in the space such as CoinCodex, Gemini, and others anticipate BTC to break the $100,000 mark , and even peak $170,000 per BTC  by August 2025. Proof-of-Work (PoW), the consensus mechanism that governs the Bitcoin network and other cryptos, has had a somewhat rocky history given it’s rather high energy consumption comparable  to a small country. Energy Consumption and Waste in Bitcoin MiningThe entire lifecycle of a Bitcoin mining operation is marked by substantial energy use, starting from the extraction and processing of raw materials for manufacturing mining hardware and constructing the mining facility. This initial… — Kevin Bambrough (@BambroughKevin) April 17, 2024   In the face of this criticism, new mining equipment, technologies, and methods were developed to mine BTC. As noted earlier, halving cycles tend to prune outdated and less efficient mining rigs. This is, arguably, a net positive for PoW overall. According to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index , Bitcoin mining has become more energy efficient since 2012. However, that hasn’t exactly translated into PoW requiring less energy. Miners may seek greener energy sources to power new mining rigs that can do more and consume less resources. The reduced supply of BTC, meanwhile,  suggests the machines will need to ‘drill deeper’ to extract any value."
2024-04-15 17:14:00+00:00,Bitcoin Halving Supply Shock: What Happens When Supply Cuts in Half?,https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/bitcoin-halving-supply-shock/,"With another historical Bitcoin Halving set to take place in a matter of days, we thought it would be the perfect time to explain what causes supply shock in markets, how this influences supply and demand dynamics, and what it could mean for the fourth Bitcoin Halving. With more factors at play than ever before, this year’s halving could market trends shift in a new, unknown direction. In traditional stock markets, supply shock refers to a sudden and significant disruption to the total supply of a particular stock or security. They can occur as a result of numerous factors. These include In short, anything that could affect the supply of a product. Watch as the supply of Bitcoin on exchanges diminishes each day, signaling its scarcity. With the halving approaching, Bitcoin's limited supply becomes even more apparent. A supply shock is on the horizon. pic.twitter.com/Wr0V3K3YAO  — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) April 7, 2024   Supply shocks can lead to rapid price movements. Therefore, they can make a market volatile, as traders react to a sudden imbalance of supply and demand. In the context of Bitcoin, a supply shock can happen as the result of the Bitcoin Halving event which occurs approximately every four years. It is set to happen again  on April 19, 2024. During a halving, the number of new BTC created and distributed to miners for validating transactions is cut in half. This results in a decreased supply of fresh BTC tokens entering the market. As it is designed from the outset to be a deflationary asset, supply shocks in Bitcoin have a profound effect on its supply and demand dynamics, which can potentially lead to upward pressure on the price thanks to the increased scarcity of the token. Indeed, the capped total supply of 21 million coins is a fundamental part of Bitcoin’s design. To be brief, supply and demand is a fundamental concept of economics that outlines the availability of a product/service (supply) and the desire for it (demand). In markets, this can determine the price of an asset as well as the buy and sell volumes of said asset. With the Bitcoin Halving, the freshly minted BTC miners receive for solving blocks and adding new ones to the blockchain are halved, thus increasing the scarcity of BTC. This slows the supply growth, although it doesn’t always convert into increased demand. Investor interest and adoption spur demand almost more than anything else. Regulatory developments, technological advances, credit interest rates, global events, and other macroeconomic conditions can influence demand for Bitcoin. The Bitcoin Halving has historically resulted in supply shocks to the market. This is because the new supply of BTC tokens entering the market decreases significantly. This interplay between the fixed supply of BTC, the halving event, and the fluctuation of demand from investors sets the market’s conditions. There is certainly some truth to there being such thing as a ‘Bitcoin Halving cycle’, which is largely characterized by a price dip before or after the event, which is then followed by a rally in the market, and quite often new all-time-highs (ATH) for BTC. $BTC  Halving is an important event because it reduces the supply and increases demand and if we look at the chart below we see that BTC dumped after the halving in 2016, before halving in 2020, and how will it be this time?Despite of that, every halving brought us to the new ATH… pic.twitter.com/EfDxeDuK00  — Nikola Trader (@NikolaTrader_DE) February 22, 2024   On November 28, 2012, the first Bitcoin Halving took place, reducing the block reward from 50 BTC to 25 BTC. In August that year, BTC peaked at $13.50 before dropping to $8. By the beginning of the halving, BTC was trading at approximately $12. This became $42 after 100 days, and over $1,000 by the end of 2013. The second Halving occurred on July 9, 2016. Then, the block reward fell to 12.5 BTC. It was around this time that BTC and crypto had begun to enter the mainstream. Prior to this Halving, BTC peaked at around $766 in the middle of June 2016, and dropped to around $666 on the day of the Halving. It then surged to $2,500 a year later, followed by an unprecedented bull run in late 2017 which saw BTC skirt the $20,000 price tag later that year. The third Halving took place on May 11, 2020, reducing the block reward to a mere 6.25 BTC. Bitcoin’s value had been climbing steadily throughout 2019 where it floated around the $10,000 mark. However, following the “crypto winter”, and the market crash on March 11, 2020, BTC took a huge hit and traded at around $5,200. Despite this, BTC closed 2020 at just under $30,000 per coin, an increase of over 300% for the year. This historical trend has given many investors reason to purchase BTC at a discount – if it dips – ahead of the Halving. Things are slightly different this time around. This is because BTC has already rallied from $42,000 at the beginning of the year to a new ATH of over $73,000 on March 13, 2024. Although a 20% to 40% dip could still be on the cards, the market dynamics in play are rather different this time around. Naturally, being at the front end of the Bitcoin network means miners are among the first to feel the impact of a Bitcoin Halving. Mining is a resource-intensive process requiring a great deal of computational power. This requires a lot of expensive hardware, space to store the mining rigs, and ever-increasing energy prices. Supply shock may have an acute effect on miners as they rely on a steady stream of block rewards. However, when the reward halves, they must adapt to the reduced income in order to stay competitive. Miners unable to adjust to the increased difficulty by upgrading their equipment, or who cannot cover the costs of their operations may have to shut down. This could be a driver behind pre-halving price dips, as miners unload their BTC to purchase necessary pre-Halving upgrades. Don’t expect a big move up for #Bitcoin  right after halving. Miners still have #Bitcoin  stacks to sell to prop up their revenue. Similar to previous halvings the supply shock comes in a few months. Likely Q4’23. — MioMind 💎 (@Mio_Mind) April 15, 2024   This can lead to temporary declines in the hash rate supplied to the Bitcoin network as inefficient miners go offline. It can also contribute to fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price. This year’s Halving event is considerably different to those of years gone by. This is because both Bitcoin and crypto in general have become a major part of the global financial system. The evolution is best reflected by the ever-growing, and newly approved, institutional-grade BTC products, such as spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These, potentially, help legitimize Bitcoin as a financial asset. The Bitcoin halving is just 4 days away. Institutions from all over the world are lining up to get a piece of the Bitcoin pie. A massive supply shock is brewing. A $100K BTC is programmed. Once that happens, altcoins will explode.… — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) April 15, 2024   As mentioned earlier, the recent rally around BTC and the overall crypto market has been significant. Although the price of BTC has retraced from the all-time high of over $73,000 to around $64,000 at time of writing (April 15), there appears to be no hint of a major decline in price ahead of the halving. This is in contrast to previous cycles. Holders and speculators are likely to trade on these recurring narratives. Despite some volatility in the overall crypto market, BTC is remaining particularly resilient in the lead-up to the fourth Halving. That said, supply shock can set in after the fact, and will likely reverberate across the entire market and its many participants. Optimistically, the resilience of BTC’s price ahead of the Halving suggests that supply shock may no longer be as impactful as it once was, especially for miners. Nevertheless, as is often the case with crypto, this could change at a moment’s notice."

Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin experienced notable weakness as Middle Eastern tensions led to volatility in the stock market. The global stock market, particularly the Asia-Pacific market, declined due to the potential for higher oil prices. However, while the stock market is recovering, Bitcoin trading volume is seeing a fall. On the other hand, though, BTC dominance has hit its highest level in three years. The Middle Eastern tensions led to a ripple effect across global stock markets. Iran’s military action against Israel reportedly involved over 300 missiles and drones. With new fears of an Israel retaliation, there is investor anxiety. Bloomberg’s EMEA index is currently down at least 1%. Meanwhile, the global stock market, particularly the Asia Pacific region, fell on the potential of oil price rise. A rise in oil prices is also generally linked to a fall in Bitcoin price. Kosovo joins allies around the world in condemning Iran's attack against Israel.  This major escalation is leading to unprecedented instability in the region and beyond, with innocent lives bearing the brunt of its devastating toll.  Peace efforts must prevail. — Vjosa Osmani (@VjosaOsmaniPRKS) April 14, 2024   Bitcoin‘s price has tumbled 10% after reaching its all-time high of over $73,700 in mid-March. CoinGecko data revealed that BTC is still performing slightly better than the overall crypto market despite the daily trading volume dropping by 35%. It was reported that crypto lost $200 billion in market cap minutes after the attack. A fall in trading activity could signal caution on the back of Israel-Iran tensions which escalated on April 13 and 14. At the time of writing (April 15 2024), the response of the global stock market was mixed.  The decline in Bitcoin’s price is close to 8% in the week before April 15. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance reached its highest level above 55% since April 2021. BTC dominance rose 2% in the last week as per TradingView  charts. According to CoinShares data , there were minor outflows from digital asset investment products totaling $126 million in the last week. While the report points at hesitancy among investors, this could deepen as a direct consequence of regional uncertainty impacting the financial markets. #bitcoin  dominance at 3 year high. pic.twitter.com/i8k9NBJr03  — Adam Back (@adam3us) April 12, 2024   Reports noted  Israel’s strong response to the attacks, promising to “exact a price” from Iran. It suggests further escalations which could continue to disturb crypto while the stock market noted some recovery at the time of writing. Chris Burniske, partner at Placeholder, hinted at positive outcomes for cryptocurrencies should the situation between Israel and Iran de-escalate. He suggests that reducing tensions could lead to a “leverage reset” and a “weak-hand flush,” setting up a favorable environment ahead of Bitcoin halving. If the Israel <> Iran situation de-escalates (tbd), crypto's leverage reset and weak-hand flush is a nice setup going into the halving. — Chris Burniske (@cburniske) April 15, 2024   Meanwhile, some crypto community members have started a conversation against US President Joe Biden. Crypto Lawyer called  Biden the “most anti-Israel President.” The US has assured of non-participation in offensive actions against Iran. In response, the Twitter has started to praise Trump, who recently said that the attack could have been defused if he were the President. As the situation in Israel and Iran unfolded, financial market stability took a hit before clocking some recovery. Meanwhile, political sentiments continue to evolve in the US based on its support of the Israeli ally. Bitcoin price could tumble if the tensions escalate but recovery is anticipated if the situation defuses. But the military actions have led to increased market volatility and investors should remain vigilant and prepared for fluctuations in both the crypto and broader financial markets."

Key Takeaways
 The last few days  marked a departure from the recent calm experienced in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin and altcoins have faced significant declines, likely influenced by recent statements from several United States Federal Reserve presidents and reports of escalating tensions between Iran and Israel.  As a result, BTC’s price  has seen a sharp drop, with altcoins experiencing even steeper losses. This market downturn could be seen as an ideal moment  for critics like Peter Schiff, known for his pessimistic views on cryptocurrencies, to renew their criticisms. However, it’s important to note that gold, often touted by Schiff as a safer investment, also experienced a price drop  when markets opened yesterday. Peter Schiff recently highlighted Bitcoin’s significant price drop. He pointed out that it has fallen to slightly above $61,000, or 26 ounces of gold. This is a 30% decline from two-and-a-half years ago when one Bitcoin was valued at 37 ounces of gold. Schiff’s comments suggest that Bitcoin, when measured against gold, is experiencing a bear market. Bitcoin just flash crashed to just above $61K. That's just 26 ounces of gold. At its peak 2.5 years ago one #Bitcoin  was worth 37 ounces of #gold . That's a decline of 30%. Digital Fool's Gold is clearly in a bear market when priced in real gold. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) April 13, 2024   According to Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, Bitcoin miners might sell off approximately $5 billion worth of BTC following the upcoming halving, an event anticipated to occur around April 20. Thielen’s analysis, shared in an April 13 analyst note, suggests that the impact of this potential liquidation could extend over four to six months, likely keeping Bitcoin prices stable without significant gains. This trend aligns with previous patterns observed after halvings, such as in 2020 when Bitcoin prices remained confined between $9,000 and $11,500 for five months post-halving. Thielen predicts a similar “summer lull” this year, indicating that the crypto market might not experience any major price increases until around October, based on historical trends. The total market capitalization  of all cryptocurrencies has taken a severe hit, plummeting by more than $400 billion in just over 24 hours, now standing at $2.350 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. This sharp decline from $2.8 trillion a day ago is down to several factors. Notably, a red Friday emerged following comments from the United States Federal Reserve officials indicating that interest rates would not be lowered in the near future. Adding to the market’s volatility, geopolitical tensions have escalated. Recent developments involve Israel and Iran, contributing to today’s market crash. A few weeks ago, reports surfaced  that Israel had eliminated a senior Iranian commander in Damascus, Syria. Following this, news broke of Iran preparing a counter-strike, including the seizure of an Israel-linked cargo ship by Iran’s navy. In response, Israel’s military has been on full alert, with certain operations suspended, indicating heightened preparedness for potential conflicts. The United States has heightened its alert status following President Biden’s unexpected early return from Delaware this weekend. The Pentagon has reported that US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is in direct contact with Israeli counterparts to address “urgent regional threats”. This development comes during escalating tensions and recent events involving Iran and Israel. The US government’s swift actions highlight the seriousness with which it is taking the potential risks in the region."

Key Takeaways
 Michael Saylor, founder and chairman of MicroStrategy, shared his opinion  on the social media platform X. He stated that “chaos benefits Bitcoin,” a statement that reverberated as the cryptocurrency’s value dipped to a little over $60,000, its lowest level in around a month. Despite facing significant market losses, Michael Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy, views the recent political turmoil as beneficial for Bitcoin. Chaos is good for #Bitcoin . — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) April 13, 2024   The technology firm, which holds a substantial Bitcoin portfolio of 214,245 BTC, recorded a staggering $1.5 billion loss in just 24 hours, with Bitcoin’s price swinging from a high of $67,900 to a low of $60,900. However, MicroStrategy still boasts a considerable overall gain, with profits exceeding $6.26 billion. This, in turn, is based on an average purchase price of $35,372 per Bitcoin. The only losses occurred in its two most recent purchases, when Bitcoin prices were above $67,000. In the context of Iran’s attack on Israel, some crypto market participants have criticized the MicroStrategy boss’ remarks as insensitive, given the broader context of the situation. However, some support Saylor’s perspective, including another user on Twitter who said : “Bitcoin is a hedge against chaos.” Well it's about to get very chaotic for Bitcoin ETF investors. But I doubt they will find anything good about it. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) April 14, 2024   In the space of 24 hours, Bitcoin has plummeted  more than 10%, dropping from around $68,000 to the $60,000 range. Experts link this sharp decline to rising international tensions, particularly between Iran and Israel. However, BTC has struggled somewhat since reaching an all-time high in March. The fall in Bitcoin’s value has particularly affected leverage traders who had opened long positions in BTC. According to data from WhaleWire, these traders saw over $1.2 billion in Bitcoin long positions liquidated within a single day. This was an event that did not have an equivalent in the last 15 years."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Bitcoin Cash Halving an Insight For BTC? BCH Price & Open Interest Down After Event,https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/bitcoin-cash-open-interest-declines-after-halving/,"
Key Takeaways
 More than a week after the Bitcoin Cash halving, the price of BCH has barely budged, having fallen back down from a 10% spike in the 24 hours immediately after the event.  Coinalyze data  shows that open interest in the cryptocurrency has also dropped from a high of $665 million on April 5 to just $340 million a week later. Often seen as a proxy for Bitcoin, BCH’s disappointing post-halving performance could foreshadow a similar downturn for BTC later this month.  Since Bitcoin Cash forked from Bitcoin in 2017, the two produced blocks at different rates, resulting in a growing gap between the dates at which rewards for each one are reduced by half. Due to small differences in block rate that add up over time, Bitcoin Cash printed block number 840,000 on April 3, while the main Bitcoin chain is on course to reach the same milestone on April 20. 🟢 Bitcoin Cash Undergoes Halving Event, Sets Stage for May Upgrade The latest block data reveals that the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network has undergone its anticipated reward-halving event. Consequently, BCH miners are now rewarded with half the amount they previously earned before… pic.twitter.com/tjz5ZsDAEB  — DefiLabs (@defilabs_farm) April 11, 2024   After the first Bitcoin Cash halving in 2020, the price of BCH fell by around 12% in the following week, from $252 to $222.  When Bitcoin underwent its own halving four weeks later, the pullback was even more stark, with the price of BTC retracing by as much as 17% in 7 days. From March 20, open interest in BCH derivatives climbed near-continuously until it reached $887 million on April 5, 2 days after its halving. But the figure has since retreated.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s open interest hit a local peak of $36.22 billion on April 1. While it has dropped back down since, there is still time for the BTC derivatives market to heat up between now and the upcoming halving next week.  If it follows the pattern of BCH, however, the days that follow will see BTC open interest decline. As a general rule, decreased open interest correlates with low price volatility.  Following the halvings of 2020, the price of Bitcoin didn’t start to rise again until October. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash remained flat until December. After all previous Bitcoin halvings, the cryptocurrency has made its most significant gains after an initial period of trading sideways (from a long-term perspective at least).  Halvings are widely recognized as catalysts for price growth, which is the logical result of the change in BTC supply. That being said, the timing of each bull run has differed, and there is no way to predict when the post-halving surge will come.  "
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Bitcoin DeFi Heats Up: Can BTCFi Challenge Ethereum’s Throne After Halving?,https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/bitcoin-defi-heats-up-btcfi-challenge-ethereum/,"
Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi), also known as BTCFi, represents an emerging trend aiming to extend DeFi functionalities to Bitcoin, the pioneering blockchain network. With its current trajectory of adoption, BTCFi is positioned to rival the innovation seen within Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem in the foreseeable future. The market’s growing demand is gravitating towards platforms that can handle increasing transaction volumes and heightened expectations. Within this context, DeFi emerges as a unique sector with the capacity to harness such a narrative, offering a resilient environment that supports Bitcoin’s diversified applications. This trend underscores the potential of Bitcoin DeFi to rival, and possibly surpass, the level of innovation and sophistication found in Ethereum’s DeFi space, signaling a significant shift towards more advanced and versatile financial solutions within the blockchain ecosystem. In a striking demonstration of the burgeoning interest in Bitcoin-native DeFi applications, recent reports highlight that a decentralized exchange (DEX) successfully raised an impressive 6,599 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $480 million, during its initial DEX offering (IDO) on April 5. This significant financial milestone attracted over 52,000 participants, setting a new precedent for IDOs and showcasing the strong market confidence in projects centered around Bitcoin’s DeFi capabilities. This fundraising event serves as a vivid illustration of the community’s readiness to participate in and propel the DeFi revolution using Bitcoin’s infrastructure. It marks a critical shift in the perspective towards the untapped potential of Bitcoin within the DeFi sector, accentuating a widespread demand for pioneering, decentralized financial solutions built upon the world’s foremost cryptocurrency, with the Bitcoin price reference sourced from CoinMarketCap . The context of this IDO’s success is further enriched by the evolving landscape of BTCFi (Bitcoin Finance), which has seen considerable growth following the introduction of the BRC-20 token standard. This development enabled the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain for the first time, giving rise to Bitcoin-native NFTs, or Ordinals. These Ordinals are inscribed directly onto satoshis (sats), ensuring their permanent placement on the Bitcoin network, a stark contrast to numerous NFT collections whose images and metadata reside on centralized servers, posing potential security vulnerabilities. Punk 3100 bought for 4,500 ETH ($16,032,959.47 USD) by 0x705876 from 0x7b8961. https://t.co/YMzLi5i8se  #cryptopunks  #ethereum  pic.twitter.com/FcdGF83uNc  — CryptoPunks Bot (@cryptopunksbot) March 4, 2024   The surging interest in Bitcoin-native NFTs is underscored by the network surpassing 64.1 million Ordinals inscriptions in less than a year and a half since the pioneering Ordinal was inscribed in December 2022. This trend highlights the expanding role of Bitcoin within the realms of DeFi and NFTs, indicating a deeper integration of Bitcoin across various decentralized finance aspects beyond its initial conception as digital gold. The advent of Bitcoin layer-2 technologies represents another critical milestone in the diversification of Bitcoin’s utility. Prior to these technological advancements, Bitcoin’s native assets were predominantly viewed as a digital store of value, with their practical applications being somewhat limited. However, the emergence of layer-2 solutions has fundamentally transformed the landscape, unlocking a plethora of new utilities for Bitcoin assets and introducing a wide array of use cases. This shift not only broadens the functional scope and applicability of Bitcoin but also signifies a substantial leap towards cultivating a more inclusive and versatile DeFi ecosystem, anchored by the robust security and foundational strength of the Bitcoin network."

Key Takeaways
 At the Paris Blockchain Week, notable venture capitalist Tim Draper shared his outlook on Bitcoin’s future, forecasting a significant surge in its value for the year 2024. He attributed this potential increase to the influx of investments into spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the anticipated Bitcoin halving event, but has previously said women and their spending habits could help. Draper’s optimistic projection  is based on a combination of these influential market factors, suggesting a tripling in Bitcoin’s valuation within the next year. Draper mentioned that, based on his assessment, the potential for Bitcoin to reach $250,000 by the year’s end looks promising, reflecting on his earlier prediction for 2022. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States has played a pivotal role in attracting new interest and investment into the Bitcoin space. Draper highlights  these investment vehicles as a key factor in drawing investors interested in Bitcoin but hesitant about the complexities of direct ownership and self-custody. Additionally, he views these ETFs as effective tools for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and protect their wealth from the depreciation of fiat currencies. He said : “I think that it gives people an opportunity to buy some Bitcoin and hold on to it so that they can take care of themselves when there’s a run on the dollar or the euro.” Investors seeking to diversify their investment portfolios without stepping away from traditional fund management now have the option through Bitcoin ETFs. This approach allows investors to stay with familiar fund managers at institutions like Fidelity or JPMorgan while incorporating the burgeoning asset class of Bitcoin into their broader investment strategy. Draper points to Bitcoin’s capped supply and its growing acceptance as a means of payment as key factors enhancing its attractiveness. He contrasts this with fiat currencies, which face inflation and diminishing buying power. Draper expresses a preference for Bitcoin over fiat currencies, which he perceives as losing value due to governmental actions and unchecked spending, seeing Bitcoin as a robust defense against inflationary pressures. He stated : “I think I’ve actually started to see the lines cross. People feel more comfortable with their Bitcoin than they do with their dollars.” Tim Draper has previously articulated his anticipation for a significant uptick in Bitcoin’s value, attributing the potential surge to its adoption among women. Fantastic podcast with @TheWolfofAllStreets. I recommend you listen to me at 2X speed. Slow speech day. Important points. #centralafricanrepublic  #elsalvador  #jeffbezos  #bitcoin  #freedom  #trust  https://t.co/nqXD3tLCZY  — Tim Draper (@TimDraper) May 28, 2022   He envisages a future where “All the women will have Bitcoin wallets, and they will be buying things with Bitcoin,” leading to a price escalation that surpasses his $250,000 prediction. This perspective underscores the impact of broadening Bitcoin’s user base and the potential for increased demand to drive up its market value. The upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April 20, is poised to significantly alter market dynamics, a development that Draper insists investors should pay close attention to. Drawing a parallel to stock market wisdom, Draper advises, “If you’re an investor in the stock market, they say don’t bet against the Fed. If you’re a Bitcoin buyer, don’t bet against the halving.” Venture capitalist Tim Draper predicts a $250K #Bitcoin  by 2024, driven by ETF inflows & the halving. With fiat currencies losing value, Bitcoin emerges as a vital hedge. ETFs make BTC accessible, while halving reduces supply, driving demand. Are you ready for the #crypto  surge? — BlockVoyager (@BlockVoyagerAIO) April 11, 2024   He highlights the basic principles of supply and demand to explain how the halving event, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin. In contrast, demand remains constant or increases, naturally leads to a price increase. Draper further advocates  for Bitcoin as a strategic hedge, suggesting that even minimal exposure to the cryptocurrency could serve as a safeguard against the backdrop of concerns over bank instability and the depreciation of sovereign currencies. This perspective underscores the increasing relevance of Bitcoin in diversifying investment portfolios amid uncertain economic conditions."

Key Takeaways
 During the Bitcoin Policy Summit held at the National Press Club in Washington, dialogues unfolded among lawmakers concerning the future of Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency legislation. Congressman Patrick McHenry emphasized the need for both Democrats and Republicans to grasp the core principles of Bitcoin. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Cynthia Lummis are on the brink of introducing new legislation aimed at stablecoins. Congressman Patrick McHenry highlighted the importance of understanding the foundational principles of Bitcoin as outlined in Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper for both Democrats and Republicans. He said, “That they just need to spend a little time to understand, and if they understand, I think they will come to light here.” He suggested that reading the whitepaper would facilitate more informed discussions. McHenry pointed out that a lack of basic understanding of Bitcoin and blockchain technology often leads individuals to fall prey to misinformation and subsequently propagate inaccuracies.  The Congressman added, “And I think that is that is the foundational problem.” He emphasized that misinformation is a significant issue, particularly when it fosters opposition to digital assets based on misconceptions rather than recognizing their potential benefits of enabling ownership and transactions without intermediaries. McHenry’s statement underscores the need for policymakers to educate themselves on the technology behind Bitcoin to counteract false narratives and appreciate the innovation and opportunities it represents, especially in terms of financial independence and efficiency.

Senator Cynthia Lummis believes that the current stance towards Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is largely influenced by fear among some high-ranking policymakers. She said, ” The state of play on Capitol Hill is, I think, best explained by what I see as the overarching motivations. And in this administration, there are a number of high-ranking policy positions that are held by people who are threatened by Bitcoin, because they know they can’t control it.” According to Forbes , Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Senator Cynthia Lummis are preparing to introduce new legislation focused on stablecoins in the coming days. They highlighted ongoing negotiations and indicated that the goal of this legislation is to align with Bitcoin’s foundational purpose as a payment method. By collaborating with major regulatory bodies like the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department, and the New York State Department of Financial Services, the proposed legislation aims to create a framework that would allow entities that do not hold customer deposits (non-depository institutions) to issue stablecoins. Congressman McHenry is of the view that the legislation could make a debut in 2024. As Congress returns this week and crypto returns to the convo, Sen. Warren is out with a letter to Reps.

Lummis believes these individuals view Bitcoin as a threat due to its decentralized nature and the inability of governments to exert direct control over it. The senator added, “They know its potential. And these are people that are so wedded to the government being in control of the money, how it’s spent, how it’s used, that they find it threatening, that something exists that they can’t control.” As we approach #bitcoin 's fourth halving, here's a relevant email from November 6th, 2008 responding to Satoshi's white paper.

According to Lummis, “We’re seeing things like a proposed 30% tax on Bitcoin mining…that was just egregious. And so these are the policy headwinds.” For Lummis, regulatory clampdown represents attempts to curb the growth and influence of Bitcoin due to its potential to operate outside traditional government-controlled financial mechanisms."
2024-04-15 13:21:00+00:00,Bitcoin Outflows Continue: How Are ETFs Affecting the Price of BTC?,https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/bitcoin-outflows-etfs-price-bitcoin/,"
Key Takeaways
 In recent weeks, the cryptocurrency market has observed notable outflows from Bitcoin ETFs, a movement that has coincided with fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price. As reported by CCN, there’s been a significant dip in Bitcoin’s price , with a 17.5% decrease as ETF outflows neared $500M​. Similarly, some reports highlighted the continued outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) following its conversion to an ETF, with net outflows totaling nearly $4 billion since the conversion​​. Net outflows from Bitcoin spot ETFs, were notably the over $300 million outflow from GBTC on a single day, contributing to a broader pattern of net outflows amounting to $85.84 million​​. 📉 On April 9, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a total net outflow of $19.48M. #Grayscale 's $GBTC  experienced a outflow of $154M, while #BlackRock 's $IBIT  had a net inflow of $128M. pic.twitter.com/w1wjcxH3HS  — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) April 10, 2024   The correlation between ETF outflows and Bitcoin price movements offers insights into market sentiment and investor behavior. The outflows, particularly from significant funds like GBTC, signal a cautious or bearish stance from investors, possibly in anticipation of market downturns or in response to macroeconomic factors. This caution is reflected in Bitcoin’s price, which has seen a decrease, dipping below key psychological thresholds like $67,000​. Conversely, despite these outflows and the price dip, there remains a sustained interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investment products. For instance, despite Grayscale’s significant outflows, it continues to be a dominant player in the space due to its longstanding presence and the trust it has built over years​. The current outflows and price corrections occur against the backdrop of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, a significant occurrence that historically influences Bitcoin’s price and market sentiment. The halving reduces the reward for mining new blocks, effectively decreasing the new Bitcoin supply entering the market. This event has, in past cycles, led to bullish market sentiment and price increases as the supply of new Bitcoins tightens. 🔶In simple terms let's use an example:Imagine you have a jar of cookies, and you and your friends enjoy them every day. Initially, you allow everyone to have ten cookies daily. But you have a rule where every month, the number of cookies each person can take is reduced by half. pic.twitter.com/XEqgMLX6XH  — OxeeTrades 🔮 (@OxeeTrades) April 9, 2024   Given the recent ETF outflows and price volatility, investors and market watchers will be keenly observing how these dynamics play out in the lead-up to and aftermath of the halving event. Whether the current outflows are a temporary realignment of investments or indicative of a more profound shift in market sentiment remains to be seen. However, the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, coupled with significant events like the halving, ensures that Bitcoin remains a focal point of investor interest and speculation. The ongoing developments underscore the complex interplay between market instruments like ETFs and the cryptocurrencies they represent. As the landscape evolves, understanding these dynamics will be crucial for both seasoned investors and newcomers to the cryptocurrency market."

Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin’s exchange reserves have hit a new low this April, dropping below 2 million BTC, which is less than 10% of its total circulating supply. This significant decrease in exchange reserves to 1.94 million BTC, accounting for approximately 9.8% of the total 19.67 million circulating Bitcoin, suggests a looming supply shock amid increasing demand, according to data  shared by CryptoQuant. Since hitting a high  in July 2021 of 2.85 million BTC, Bitcoin’s exchange reserves have seen a consistent decline as investors increasingly choose to hold their Bitcoin for the long term rather than trade it. #Bitcoin  exchange reserves have dropped to their lowest points since early 2021. This means growing preference among investors for long-term holding strategies. pic.twitter.com/pcddVlViq4  — Suresh Dholia (@SureshDholia) April 5, 2024   This trend toward holding indicates a growing preference for viewing Bitcoin as a long-term investment. A supply shock, which occurs when the available supply of Bitcoin on exchanges drops sharply while demand increases, often results in price spikes due to a higher volume of buy orders relative to sell orders. Significant withdrawals from exchanges, which reduce the available supply for trading, are a primary driver of such shocks, potentially leading to a rapid increase in Bitcoin’s price. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which reduces miner rewards by half every four years, is anticipated to significantly constrain the new supply of Bitcoin, thereby intensifying the effect of a supply shock. Some reports underscored the gravity of the situation, noting that only 1.7 million Bitcoins remain on exchanges. This scarcity, coupled with the nearing halving event, is expected to trigger a pronounced supply shock, potentially catalyzing a substantial increase in Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin Halving is an event that cuts Bitcoin mining rewards in half every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, as a way to control inflation. Halving is considered an important moment that can affect mining profits and market dynamics. countdown to Bitcoin Halving!!!💫🚀 — Based Studio (@Basedstudioo) April 5, 2024   This scenario highlights the delicate equilibrium between supply and demand in the cryptocurrency market, underscoring the strategic importance of holding and timing around significant market milestones like the Bitcoin halving. 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 80,000,000 #USDT  (79,961,600 USD) transferred from Tether Treasury to unknown wallethttps://t.co/gm19RS3gNJ  — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) April 2, 2024  "

Key Takeaways
 Leading Web3 infrastructure provider Metaplanet  has acquired $6.6 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC). The news boosted its Tokyo-listed stock by an astounding 90% surge in less than two trading sessions. The company positioned this acquisition as a strategic move to minimize exposure to the Japanese yen. But also aims to solidify its stance as a pioneer in digital asset adoption within Japan. And it now joined a large group of public companies – especially in the US – to buy BTC. Metaplanet , formerly known as Red Planet, initially operated as a budget hotel operator. Then, it transitioned into a Web3 software developer. The company has recently made a strategic move by acquiring Bitcoin. The decision, aimed at reducing exposure to the Japanese yen, reflects concerns over the yen’s vulnerability in Japan’s prolonged low-interest-rate environment. And it anticipates just of a few days the long-expected Bitcoin halving. In an update  to shareholders, the company highlighted the yen’s diminishing stature as a global currency amid Japan’s persistent low-interest-rate policy. Notably, the central bank’s first rate hike in 17 years, raising short-term interest rates from minus 0.1% to 0-0.1%, underscores this concern.

(@Metaplanet_JP) April 8, 2024   Metaplanet’s decision to integrate Bitcoin into its treasury activities stems from a nuanced understanding of its potential benefits. The move serves as a hedge against inflation, enhances macroeconomic resilience, and offers prospects for long-term capital appreciation. The initiative is demonstrating far-reaching impacts beyond its original scope. Moreover, Metaplanet’s acquisition of BTC was executed distinctively. It garnered support from prominent entities such as Sora Ventures, Morgan Creek Capital’s Mark Yusko, and others. For Metaplanet, Bitcoin represents not only a potential source of investment gains. However, it also has implications that extend to the broader cryptocurrency industry. This announcement underscores the growing significance of Bitcoin within the Asian region. By providing investors with a regulatory-compliant avenue to access BTC, Metaplanet is pioneering a path for public companies in the region to follow suit. Japanese firm #Metaplanet  invests $6.5M in #Bitcoin , following MicroStrategy's strategy, to use $BTC  as a core treasury asset.

As the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy boasts 214,246 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $15.0 billion. Based in Virginia, this intelligence software firm initiated its Bitcoin acquisitions in 2020, rapidly expanding its holdings to dwarf its peers. MicroStrategy’s stock surged over 350% in 2023, buoyed by its substantial Bitcoin reserves. Tesla ranks third among corporate Bitcoin holders, with holdings valued at $554.2 million. In 2021, the company invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin to bolster its financial performance and provide liquidity to customers who could purchase its products using the cryptocurrency. However, during the subsequent crypto market downturn, Tesla sold a significant portion of its Bitcoin holdings at a substantial loss. Additionally, two Canadian companies, Hut 8  and Hive Blockchain , stand out as prominent Bitcoin holders. These cryptocurrency mining firms have witnessed impressive share price increases of over 191% and 144%, respectively."

Key Takeaways
 With less than 2 weeks to go until the next Bitcoin halving, historical precedent suggests the cryptocurrency’s price could rise further in the next 12 days. But what will happen after the event? With many traders expecting a price peak around the time of the halving, selling pressure could cause the market to slump. Following the November 2012 halving, the price of Bitcoin remained flat for around a month after the event before rocketing to new heights in the spring.  Four years later, BTC peaked nearly 3 weeks before the halving, but then pulled back sharply, taking over 3 months to regain momentum and start rising again. Finally, Bitcoin traded sideways for around 2 months after the 2020 event, consolidating gains it had made in the previous 2 months. In a recent blog post , BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes acknowledged that the upcoming halving is bullish for crypto markets in the medium term. “However, the price action directly before and after could be negative,” he cautioned. “The narrative of the halving being positive for crypto prices is well entrenched. When most market participants agree on a certain outcome, the opposite usually occurs. That is why I believe Bitcoin and crypto prices in general will slump around the halving.” ""Heatwave"" is an essay on why I'm bearish despite the recent move higher in #crypto  markets.https://t.co/gZ8Vl1uC04  pic.twitter.com/fH6docB499  — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) April 9, 2024   Hayes said he has already offloaded his more speculative crypto assets, placing the profits into Ethena’s high-yield USDe. For traders who want to short crypto markets, he said the best time was between April 15 and May 1st, when tax payments will take liquidity from the system, creating precarious conditions for risky asset markets. For his part, Hayes has no plans to short anything. Instead, he will simply hold off from trading until May and then buy back in ahead of an anticipated bull market in the summer. Many analysts have compared the upcoming halving to those that went before. However, other events that affected the price of Bitcoin are also worth considering. If #BTC  repeats the pattern that it had going into the spot ETF as it goes into the halving, then it would look something like this.

 Bitcoin’s robust start to the second week of April saw its price surge past the $70,000 milestone, igniting widespread anticipation in the trading community for a potential test of all-time highs. This upswing comes after a period of consolidation, with traders and investors eyeing the critical block subsidy halving event due in just ten days, a factor that historically triggers volatility and market activity.

These metrics could influence the Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates and have a ripple effect on market expectations. Despite the mixed economic signals, Bitcoin’s resilience and the looming halving event keep market optimism alive, with traders speculating on the possibility of Bitcoin reaching new highs or retreating to close existing price gaps in the futures market.  Bitcoin’s recent climb to $73,800 prompted long-term holders (LTHs) to become active sellers, leveraging the increased market demand and liquidity.

Key Takeaways
 Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) finished the week on a positive note, attracting $203 million in inflows on Friday, according to the most recent figures . Following an initial dip with $84.7 million in net outflows on April 1, the ETFs made a strong recovery, amassing $569.4 million in net inflows since then. Following an initial drop on April 1, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen a continuous streak of net inflows over four days. The influx began modestly with $39.5 million on April 2, surged to $113.5 million the next day, and peaked at $213.4 million on April 4. The week concluded with an impressive $203 million inflow on Friday. Despite a positive trend in the overall market, Grayscale’s GBTC experienced the day’s most significant outflow among ETFs. Friday’s ETF trading volume totaled about $2.37 billion, a 31.5% drop from Thursday’s $3.46 billion. Nevertheless, Friday’s inflows were slightly down by 4.87% compared to Thursday. Following the outflow, GBTC holds 325,686.78 BTC.

Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin’s trading pattern has revealed that a 40% price increase has occurred outside of regular trading hours. This shift highlights the unique market dynamics of cryptocurrency trading, where after-hours movements can significantly impact overall price trends. Equity markets operate during set business hours, but the cryptocurrency market operates round the clock. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas  noted in a post the disparity between Bitcoin’s intra-day and after-hours price movements. BlackRock’s IBIT data indicates that much of Bitcoin’s price increase has happened when traditional markets are closed, with major gaps formed between the close and open prices in the US market. The vast majority of the 40% gains in bitcoin since ETF launch have been after hours with huge price gaps forming bt close and open.. great chart showing the intra-day vs after hours return for $IBIT  from @psarofagis  pic.twitter.com/3EVbyRpzra  — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 4, 2024   Generally, after-hours trading volumes are typically lower than regular trading hours in the traditional markets. In Bitcoin’s case, a smaller number of trades could be causing larger price swings, indicating the influence of institutional investors. Additionally, large volumes might be coming from non-US investors and/or non-ETF investors. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 marked the beginning of a bull run due to the influx of more liquidity. Since then, the price of Bitcoin has soared. At press time, Bitcoin flirts with the $67,000 mark suggesting some market weakness after the all-time high levels. According to CREBACO research shared with CCN, institutional investments have been strong, indicating a deep-seated trust in Bitcoin’s long-term value. The crypto research company emphasizes that while short-lived dips may occur, they are unlikely to derail Bitcoin’s bullish trajectory. For traders, this means maintaining a level head. As per CREBACO, institutional inflows surged to around $1 billion by mid-March. The report said: “As we analyze the data, it becomes evident that the overall trend in institutional investments for March was characterized by resilience and growth.”  CREBACO expects March optimism to remain steady in April. However, it finds some headwinds with open interest in BTC/USDT contracts decreasing. There has been a reduction of 10% since the start of April. The decline, coupled with minor liquidations and a dip in the funding rate, suggests a tilt toward sellers in Bitcoin perpetual contracts. However, Bitcoin halving is a positive. As per the report, further corrections are likely to remain within the 15% to 20% range. CREBACO research states that resilience is a bullish signal, indicating that Bitcoin is primed to explore fresh record highs. With after-hours trading spikes and institutional activity, the overarching narrative remains bullish for Bitcoin. The general consensus among long-term investors is one of optimism. As Bitcoin navigates through its upcoming halving, the anticipation of heightened market activity presents opportunities for strategic positioning in April."

Key Takeaways
 After trading between $68,000 and $72,000 for around a week, the price of BTC dropped sharply on Tuesday, March 2, plunging below $65,000 at the button of the dip. Against the backdrop of Tuesday’s crash, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US saw net inflows  of $39.5 million – a return to positive growth after ETF investors pulled out $85.8 million on Monday.  Although Bitcoin lost 5% of its value in a matter of minutes on Tuesday, there is no indication that the flash crash has caused any panic selling. The fact that ETFs still closed the day with positive net inflows suggests investors are confident the drop wasn’t the prelude to a more prolonged bearish spell. Stocklytics  analyst Neil Roarty told CCN: “The dip won’t overly concern investors after months of gains.” However, he noted that “it does serve as a reminder that the bullish sentiment around Bitcoin, which has seen the cryptocurrency more than double in price since the autumn, will not continue indefinitely.” Despite recent volatility, most analysts expect Bitcoin to continue on a general upward trajectory for at least the rest of the year. With many experts anticipating six figures before 2024 is over, a few bumps along the road aren’t enough to dampen the positive sentiment.

Key Takeaways
 In the midst of the burgeoning excitement around Bitcoin Spot ETFs, which have amassed nearly $12 billion in inflows and opened the gates to a fresh wave of investors, a shadow looms over the seemingly bright future of cryptocurrency investment. This shadow is cast by the centralized custody of the keys for 90% of these ETF. This brings with it the risk of monumental security breaches or internal errors that could potentially wipe out vast sums of investor capital. This would, furthermore, come without the safety net of FDIC/SIPC coverage or institutional guarantees. Jameson Lopp, aCTO at Casa , a bitcoin custody company, voices a critical perspective on the matter. It's possible to believe both that Bitcoin is the best asset in existence and that inferior assets have their uses. — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) March 31, 2024   Labeling reliance on these ETFs as a “worst practice,” Lopp draws from past banking and cryptocurrency catastrophes to underline a fundamental tenet. He says that true ownership is tied to holding your own keys. Against this, Lopp is poised to unveil what he says is one of the most secure inheritance products for major cryptocurrencies. It aims to mitigate the risks associated with ETF concentration and secure a pathway for Bitcoin’s safe transition to future generations. Speaking with CCN, Jameson Lopp delved into the growing allure of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, which have already drawn substantial investments. Lopp raised critical security alarms surrounding the centralized nature of custody services for these investments. He said the vast majority of Bitcoin Spot ETFs relied on a singular custody provider for safeguarding their keys. This arrangement, according to Lopp, introduces a significant vulnerability. Centralization in cryptocurrency custody can be a double-edged sword. While it may offer convenience and regulatory compliance, it also heightens the risk of losses due to potential security breaches or operational mishaps. Lopp said: “The problem is inherent to the fact that Bitcoin is quite easy to lose, and loss tends to be catastrophic. The more Bitcoin you put in one particular custody setup, the greater the incentive for it to be attacked, be that from internal or external parties.” Lopp’s insights shed light on the intricate balance between accessibility and the foundational principle of cryptocurrency: decentralization and the sovereign control of one’s assets. Bitcoin has been discussed on Twitter since the first week of the network's operation. The following is my attempt to cover major points in Bitcoin history as told by tweets. #repost  https://t.co/5sdpqPrEiX  — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) April 1, 2024   During an interview with CCN, Jameson Lopp critiqued the common practice of investing in Bitcoin through ETFs. He labeled it as “worst practice” for those seeking to engage with cryptocurrency. He elaborated on a crucial principle of cryptocurrency ownership – holding private keys means ownership of coins. Lopp acknowledged that ETFs offer a convenient route for financial exposure to Bitcoin, particularly within tax-advantaged retirement accounts. However, he pointed out that such investment methods sacrifice core Bitcoin properties like sovereignty and censorship resistance. Lopp also emphasized  that the Bitcoin network remains indifferent to one’s claims of ownership through ETFs, restricting transaction capabilities outside of traditional banking hours. Awesome article James! In regards to Bitcoin ETF market makers being allowed to sell more Bitcoin than they actually have in custody, are the limits for this “fractional reserve”defined somewhere? Are the same limits applied to all of the Bitcoin ETFs? I thought they were all… — Mike Haldas (@haldas) January 20, 2024   In contrast, direct holders of Bitcoin enjoy the liberty to transfer and use their assets at any time. This distinction highlights the trade-offs between convenience and the foundational principles of cryptocurrency. Lopp also talked about the potential repercussions of a major security breach in one of the Bitcoin ETFs and investor confidence. Lopp anticipates such an event would trigger a thorough forensic analysis of the custodian’s security measures and potentially usher in new regulatory requirements. Despite the existence of robust best practices developed by the CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium, he noted that regulators have yet to mandate these standards. The recent banking crises and collapses of cryptocurrency platforms underscore the opaque nature of custodians, which, despite assurances, may harbor undetected vulnerabilities.

Lopp also discussed the burgeoning sector of Bitcoin Spot ETFs and the regulatory measures necessary to bolster their security and integrity. He suggested an effective strategy for regulators would involve setting standards for storage and management of private key material by custodians. This would, he claimed, ensure adherence to established best practices. Additionally, he called for a diversified approach to custodianship by ETF providers. Lopp also emphasized the importance of spreading investments across reputable custodians to mitigate risks. This recommendation shows the need for a multifaceted approach to safeguarding investor assets in the cryptocurrency investment landscape.  "

Key Takeaways
 In a recent tweet , Edward Snowden commended Warren Buffett for his exceptional investment track record. The Russia-based whistleblower and fugitive pointed out the impressive average annual return of 20% on Berkshire Hathaway shares, juxtaposing this with the stock-selection skills of congressional members. Edward Snowden recently compared  the investment returns of Warren Buffett with those of various members of Congress. He highlighted the investment achievements of Rep. Dan Meuser (R-Pa.), former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif), Rep. Donald Beyer (D-Va.), and Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), with Meuser’s investments yielding an annual average return of 40.3%. In comparison, the investments of Pelosi, Beyer, and Gottheimer have seen returns of 21.8%, 20.3%, and 25.9%, respectively. ""Warren Buffett, the billionaire head of Berkshire Hathaway, will probably go down as the greatest investor in history… Berkshire shares have seen an average annual return of 20.0%…"" Meanwhile: pic.twitter.com/7PGgpZta63  — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) March 31, 2024   However, when these returns are put into perspective with broader market performance, a different picture emerges. The Invesco Trust Series, which mirrors the Nasdaq 100 index , has outperformed the investment returns mentioned by Snowden, with a one-year return rate of 50.74% and a start-of-the-year return of 7.36%. An early advocate for the cryptocurrency, Snowden used Bitcoin as early as 2013 to finance the servers used in the acquisition of some classified documents. Unpopular but true: Bitcoin is the most significant monetary advance since the creation of coinage. If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry. — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) February 18, 2024   Snowden humorously remarked on the exceptional trading performances of certain Congressional members. He suggested  politicians were outperforming even the most acclaimed investor in history. His ironic commendation hints at the investing prowess seemingly possessed by these representatives. The backdrop to Snowden’s commentary is a broader discourse on the stock trading activities of Congress members. The performance of an ETF that monitors the stock trades of Democratic members potentially highlights this. The ETF has outperformed the S&P 500 since its inception in 2023.

Key Takeaways
 Peter Schiff, known for his critical views on Bitcoin and advocacy for gold, has recently made remarks  that shed light on his perspective regarding the financial landscape. He particularly stressed the dynamics between Bitcoin, gold, and the broader economic environment. In his latest tweet , Schiff suggests that the rising interest and approval of Bitcoin ETFs might be inadvertently aiding central banks and large governments by diverting investor attention from gold, which he views as a significant threat to the fiat-based monetary system and the dominance of the US dollar. Bitcoin pumpers are making fun of tonight's ""meager"" $25 rise in the price of #gold . But following Friday's $39 rise, this 3% two-day gain equates to about $450 billion of total market capitalization. To match that dollar gain, #Bitcoin  would have to rise by about $23K to $94K. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) April 1, 2024   Schiff argues Bitcoin could be diluting the impact gold has on providing a counterweight to fiat currencies. This could, therefore, see it help maintain traditional financial systems​​. Schiff’s observations come amid a backdrop of increasing national debt in the US, which he highlights as a pressing concern. He points to the hyperinflation experienced by Germany  in the early 20th century as a cautionary tale. This suggests similar economic pressures could elevate Bitcoin’s value dramatically if America were to experience comparable financial turbulence. Again, this juxtaposition is made in the context of the US national debt’s alarming expansion , having more than doubled over the last 10 years. This has led to a cross-party consensus on the urgent need to reassess the viability of current fiscal policies. In 2010, the U.S. saw a groundswell rise in a movement called the “Tea Party” because the National Debt had climbed to a staggering $13.5 trillion dollars. “Unsustainable” many called it. In 14 years it’s ballooned to $35 trillion.In case you forgot. https://t.co/Z33rfF2wqM  pic.twitter.com/LshnwGv5St  — Mickey Holler (@MickeyHoller) April 1, 2024   Despite his skepticism towards Bitcoin’s utility and stability, particularly in comparison to gold, Schiff’s analysis acknowledges the complex interplay between digital currencies, traditional gold investment, and the broader economic indicators. His predictions for 2024 reflect a cautious stance on Bitcoin’s future, suggesting its recent price surge may be a bubble poised to burst. This contrasts sharply with gold’s more stable value proposition. It's very rare for #gold  to be trading over $30 higher on a Sunday night. Rarer still is for it to be doing so on no news. Something big is happening that very few investors are prepared for. More importantly, governments and central banks are not prepared for it either. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) April 1, 2024     These insights from Schiff offer a multifaceted view of the current economic landscape. They highlight the ongoing debate between digital and traditional stores of value, and potential implications for investors, central banks, and global financial stability."

Key Takeaways
 A U.K. judge has issued a global freezing order on £6 million of Craig Wright’s assets to thwart any attempt to move them offshore. This decision follows a court case that concluded Wright was not Satoshi Nakamoto, the alleged inventor of Bitcoin, as he had claimed. On March 14, Judge James Mellor, presiding over a lawsuit filed by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), ruled that Craig Wright was not the author of the Bitcoin white paper or the original versions of the Bitcoin software. Following this decision, Wright informed Companies House, the U.K.’s corporate registry, that shares in his company, RCJBR Holding, had been transferred  to DeMorgan, a firm incorporated in Singapore. A judgment published on the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund’s website on Wednesday states that the costs  incurred by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) are approximately £6.7 million. Judge James Mellor, in the judgment, highlighted serious concerns from COPA regarding Craig Wright’s actions to potentially evade the financial repercussions of his loss at trial, specifically pointing to the transfer of shares as a maneuver in this context. He stated : “Understandably, that gave rise to serious concerns on COPA’s part that Dr Wright was implementing measures to seek to evade the costs consequences of his loss at trial.” Mellor added : “Dr Wright has a history of default in relation to orders for the payment of money,” Mellor wrote, before detailing some examples. COPA has a very powerful claim to be awarded a very substantial sum in costs … I consider there is a very real risk of dissipation.” In 2023, Craig Wright initiated legal action against 13 Bitcoin Core developers and several companies, such as Blockstream, Coinbase, and Block, alleging copyright infringements connected to Bitcoin. March 29, 15 days from now, marks 5 years since I received the first legal letter from Craig Wright's lawyers, via DM on twitter. They demanded I apologize, and that I recognize Craig as Satoshi.

 The malware database vx-underground has issued a warning  about a new wave of information-stealing malware targeting video gamers, particularly those utilizing cheating software. This emerging threat has been specifically draining the Bitcoin wallets of gamers as part of a new campaign aimed at individuals seeking an unfair advantage in games. The malware information hub vx-underground disclosed  in a March 28 social media post its discovery of an unknown threat actor deploying malware to steal credentials from users of pay-to-cheat video game software. This cyber assault has impacted players, including those purchasing cheating software, leading to over 4.9 million compromised accounts associated with Activision Blizzard and its Battle.net game store, as well as the game-focused trading platform Elite PVPers and cheat software markets PhantomOverlay and UnknownCheats.

PhantomOverlay labeled this incident as “the largest info-stealer malware campaign in the history of the gaming and cheating community.” In another message,  PhantomOverlay mentioned having a solid suspicion about the malware’s source, although the group behind the malware is aware of these suspicions and has significantly obscured any evidence, making it difficult to confirm. PhantomOverlay reported  that Activision Blizzard reached out to the cheat-selling website, offering support to assist millions of users affected by the malware. Vx-underground mentioned in its post that PhantomOverlay became aware of fraudulent activities when users’ accounts started making unauthorized purchases. After contacting the initial victim, PhantomOverlay has since identified more affected individuals. In a statement, Activision Blizzard said : “There have been claims that some player credentials across the broader industry could be compromised from malware from downloading or using unauthorized software. Activision Blizzard servers remain secure and uncompromised. Our priority is always player account security. If players believe they may have clicked on a suspicious link or if they want to ensure their account is protected, they can change their password and follow recommended best practices here such as adding two factor authentication.” For years, individuals exploiting game cheaters have been a persistent issue. In 2018, a malware  disguised as a cheat tool for the widely acclaimed video game Fortnite was aimed at stealing Bitcoin wallet login information. In a subsequent event in 2019, Fortnite players became victims when hackers employed tactics that restricted users from accessing data on their computers.

Key Takeaways
 BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink is undeterred by the possibility of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classifying Ethereum’s Ether as a security. He suggested  that the creation of an Ether-based Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) remains feasible, despite the increased regulatory measures that would accompany such a designation for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. In a recent interview , Fink addressed the potential of listing an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) that includes Ethereum’s ETH, even amid speculation about its classification as a security by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Even if Ethereum is classified as a security, Ethereum ETF trading could still happen according to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. — sheila abigail (@sheilaabigail7) March 28, 2024   Fink expressed optimism, stating : “I think so.” This follows BlackRock’s introduction of a Bitcoin ETF earlier in the year, marking a significant move into the crypto space by the world’s largest asset manager. The SEC is scrutinizing Ethereum to determine if it should be classified as a security. This regulatory uncertainty has sparked debate over the feasibility of an Ethereum ETF in the US. However, Larry Fink’s optimism stands out amid this backdrop. Despite the regulatory ambiguity, eight potential issuers, including BlackRock, have moved forward with SEC filings for a spot Ethereum ETF. #WATCH : Chairman @PatrickMcHenry  demands Chair Gensler share his views on #ETH .

The firm’s iShares Bitcoin Fund (IBIT) has seen remarkable success, amassing over $15 billion in assets within just two and a half months of its launch. Larry Fink heralded IBIT as the “fastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs” during an interview.

Key Takeaways
 This year, Bitcoin has seen a notable journey with a dramatic rise and minor corrections. The approval of 11 Spot Bitcoin ETFs injected unprecedented excitement into the market, driving BTC’s price to a record $73,000 and setting expectations for future growth. Geoff Kendrick , from Standard Chartered, highlights this transformative period. He notes its impact on fueling optimism within the financial sector for Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency landscape. In an exclusive interview with CCN, Geoff Kendrick, the Head of Crypto Research and Emerging Markets (EM) FX Strategy at Standard Chartered, shares his expert insights into the remarkable journey of Bitcoin in 2024. Standard Chartered, under Kendrick’s leadership in crypto research, has made a bold revision to its Bitcoin price prediction. First predicting a year-end price of $100,000 in November 2023, the bank has since adjusted its forecast, saying BTC should hit $150,000 in 2024. ❖ BITCOIN TO RALLY TO $150,000 THIS YEAR AND COULD TOUCH $250,000 IN 2025, STANDARD CHARTERED SAYS — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) March 18, 2024   Looking further, Kendrick and Standard Chartered see an even brighter future for Bitcoin. With expectations for the cryptocurrency to potentially reach $250,000 by 2025, the bank underscores its view of Bitcoin as a rapidly evolving asset class. This projection is partly based on the forthcoming Bitcoin halving event, which is expected to bolster the asset’s price further. Kendrick’s insights reveal a comprehensive analysis of the cryptocurrency market. It showcases Standard Chartered’s thorough research and strong belief in Bitcoin. Kendrick told CCN everything regarding his bullish forecast for Bitcoin, proposing a potential rise to $200,000. He attributed this projection to a triad of considerations. Initially, he highlighted the correlation between the cryptocurrency’s price and the influx of investments into exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This, Kendrick implied, was especially true after the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States on January 11. Kendrick also pointed out the $11 billion net inflow into these ETFs and the resultant $25,000 increase in Bitcoin’s price. His analysis suggested that, as the ETF market matures, it could potentially accumulate between $50 billion and $100 billion. This could, in turn, drive the Bitcoin price upwards to about $250,000, possibly as soon as 2025. Furthermore, Geoff Kendrick drew parallels between the growth trajectories of Bitcoin and gold ETFs. Noting the historical performance of gold following the introduction of its ETFs in the US, he suggested a similar multiplier effect could apply to Bitcoin. Additionally, he discussed an asset allocation model comparing gold and Bitcoin. Kendrick suggested that current market dynamics indicate a potential for Bitcoin’s value to align more closely with gold, further supporting his target price. He said: “Part of the cycle has been downturns for Bitcoin. That says that right now you should have around 80% gold, 20% Bitcoin. The total gold value above ground is about $15 trillion. So, to get to 80:20, you can work out roughly where the Bitcoin value should be as well. “Right now, the mix in total value is about 91% gold, 9% Bitcoin. So, obviously the Bitcoin price needs to go up to make up the difference there. If you assume gold prices go broadly sideways, that again gets you to about $200,000 on Bitcoin. “For me, to have a few metrics that are pointing to something like $200,000 as being the medium term level, that tells me I should have that as my forecast for 2025.” Kendrick’s comprehensive analysis considers various metrics and historical precedents. It culminates in a medium-term forecast that not only anticipates a significant rise in Bitcoin’s price but also suggests a stabilization period afterwards. He says that, after reaching a peak, possibly even overshooting to $250,000, Bitcoin’s price might enter a phase of less volatility, akin to gold’s price movements. This would see it establishing a new normal trading range around the $200,000 mark. This scenario reflects his expectation of a more mature and stable Bitcoin market post-2025. Speaking with CCN, Geoff Kendrick addressed the recent decline in Bitcoin’s price, which fell from above $70,000 to around $60,500. Kendrick interpreted this movement as significant but reasonable volatility for Bitcoin, characterized by an 80% pullback level. The downturn coincided with three consecutive days of net outflows from Bitcoin ETFs, a notable shift after a period of consistent inflows, highlighting a momentary shift in investor behavior. Moreover, Geoff Kendrick commented on the broader market dynamics influenced by the Federal Reserve’s recent dovish stance , suggesting a potential boost for risk assets, including Bitcoin. Despite the volatility and outflows, he expressed confidence that Bitcoin would not fall below $60,000. Furthermore, he anticipated a recovery and the setting of new highs in forthcoming weeks. Kendrick characterized the observed 10% price fluctuations as typical for Bitcoin, suggesting an expectation of continued, albeit choppy, upward momentum in the near term. Bitcoin shrugged off its recent losses after yesterday's FOMC decision and press conference, with the Fed seemingly more dovish in the face of rising inflation than the market had expected. pic.twitter.com/4NXSizVPSw  — Markets & Mayhem (@Mayhem4Markets) March 21, 2024   Inquiring about the differences in Bitcoin’s current price  surge compared to its first all-time high (ATH) in 2021 , CCN queried Kendrick. He explained that the primary distinction lies in the composition of asset holders. He highlighted a significant influx of approximately $11 billion into spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since January 10, suggesting that this capital is likely to remain stable compared to leveraged futures positions. Additionally, there has been substantial growth in open interest in both futures and options markets since the same date, indicating a potentially bullish sentiment. Although the exact composition of these positions is uncertain, Kendrick assumed that most are long positions. Notably, the options market is deeper in this cycle compared to 2021. Moreover, he noted the absence of a spot ETF in the US during the previous ATH, suggesting that the current market mix is less risky. He elaborated: “In 2021, you got to a similar level in open interest in futures as we are just now, and the options market is deeper this cycle. So there’s more open interest in the options market.  In 2021, there was no spot ETF in the US, and so I’d say, on average, the mix now is less risky compared to where we were in 2021. So, because of that, I think we can keep pushing high.” Despite anticipated pullbacks due to Bitcoin’s high volatility, Kendrick expressed confidence that such dips would be bought into, particularly following dovish remarks from the Federal Reserve. Kendrick also shared his insights on the topic of altcoins in the current bull market. In particular, he focused memecoins and their relationship to underlying blockchain technologies. Kendrick noted that the phenomenon of altcoins, which gained significant attention during the 2021 cycle, marked the first instance of such widespread interest in these cryptocurrencies. He observed that Bitcoin’s rise typically precedes that of Ethereum and subsequently altcoins. This pattern has been consistent with the current market trends.  Kendrick saidthat altcoins have accelerated more quickly in this cycle compared to the last. He attributed this difference to a deeper market and greater awareness of altcoins. He commented: “You can certainly argue that the memecoins that are on Ethereum, for example, if they trade well, then that talks to the underlying confidence in the Ethereum network. In the same way, some of the new memecoins that have been very popular on Solana presumably talk to the confidence in the Solana network as well. “So, I think in that case, the memecoin story makes some sense outside of that, given there’s no particular use case for the meme coins, as you could also argue for the likes of Bitcoin. “It’s more speculative, if you like, for me, but so long as everything goes higher, they probably keep going higher.” Kendrick expressed a nuanced view on memecoins, acknowledging the difficulty in assessing their fundamentals. However, he also suggested that the success of memecoins could reflect market optimism and confidence in their blockchain platforms.

This is similar to how memecoins on Solana could signal trust in the Solana ecosystem. Despite the lack of specific use cases, Kendrick implied that, as long as the broader market sentiment remains positive, meme coins are likely to continue their upward trajectory. Kendrick talked about the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announcing a new legal strategy to potentially classify Ethereum as a security. He discussed the potential ramifications this move could have on the cryptocurrency ETF market. He also highlighted that the SEC’s classification of Ethereum as a security was not a foregone conclusion. Kendrick referred to the SEC’s previous attempt to classify 67 cryptos as securities during the Ripple case, noting that Ethereum was not among them. The uncertainty around Ethereum’s classification has led to mixed reactions, including pushback from the Senate regarding the approval of an Ethereum ETF. Geoff Kendrick observed a noticeable shift in market sentiment, illustrated by the change in the discount to net asset value for the Grayscale fund, which reflects decreased market optimism about the approval of an Ethereum ETF by the specified date of May 23. However, he speculated that prospects for an Ethereum ETF could improve significantly after the American Presidential election, especially if there’s a change in the executive.  Donald Trump’s potential return could lead to changes within the SEC that might favor the approval of an Ethereum ETF. Kendrick’s perspective underscores the fluid nature of the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and suggests that timing plays a crucial role. The Standard Chartered crypto boss weighed in on the complexities introduced by Ethereum’s proof-of-stake mechanism and its implications for other cryptocurrencies utilizing similar consensus mechanisms. He said that Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, shares similarities with various asset classes due to its proof of stake model. This, as a result, complicates its regulatory assessment. According to Kendrick, Bitcoin’s straightforward characteristics have led the SEC to compare it to commodities. This is because of its lack of yield, staking returns, and tangible real-world applications, akin to gold. Kendrick elaborated that the inclusion of staking returns in Ethereum presents a regulatory challenge. He also suggested these might best be managed within actively managed portfolios or funds that broadly trade digital assets, akin to those managed by firms like BlackRock. He noted the existence of an ETF in Europe that incorporates Ethereum’s staking returns. On the other hand, he also mentioned that the fees associated with this ETF nearly cancel out the staking yields for the end user. Despite this, the concept of combining spot value with yield from staking presents a potential model for regulatory treatment, drawing a parallel with equity ETFs that include dividends. Geoff Kendrick went on to elaborate on his price targets for Ethereum, sharing his perspective on its performance relative to Bitcoin in the coming years. He projected that Ethereum is likely to keep pace with Bitcoin through 2024, maintaining its price ratio even in the absence of an ETF approval on the speculated date of May 23. He anticipated Ethereum could reach a valuation of around $8,000 by the end of this year, assuming Bitcoin hits his forecast of $150,000. Looking ahead to 2025, Kendrick identified real-world applications for Ethereum, particularly in the gaming sector. He pointed out that popular games like Minecraft, currently owned by mega-corporations such as Microsoft, represent a market ripe for disruption by Web3 technologies. Therefore, he suggests, Ethereum is poised as a key platform for next-generation games. This shift could tap into the gaming industry’s substantial revenue, which stands at about $300 billion. This could, therefore, be a first major use case for Ethereum beyond speculative trading. Standard Chartered has updated its forecast for #Bitcoin  and #Ethereum   The bank's analysts see the price of BTC at the level of $150 thousand by the end of this year and at the level of $200-250 thousand – in 2025. For ETH, the targets are $8 and $14 thousand, respectively. pic.twitter.com/CUEESOVu9N  — Nero the Banker (@nerothebanker) March 18, 2024   Kendrick also mentioned the potential for tokenization of real-world assets on the Ethereum blockchain. Although this movement has begun, it still remains in its early stages. He predicted positive developments there could elevate Ethereum’s price ratio relative to Bitcoin to about 7%, a level last seen in 2021, by 2025. Based on his Bitcoin forecast of $200,000 for the next year, this adjustment could see Ethereum’s value soar to approximately $14,000. This, in turn, underscores the significant impact expected from the adoption of blockchain in gaming and asset tokenization."

Key Takeaways
 Over the years, Jim Cramer’s crypto journey has been a rollercoaster. After utterly condemning the entire asset class in the immediate aftermath of the FTX scandal, Cramer has since warmed to Bitcoin, reflecting a general mood shift among the investing public.  From saying that he “would not touch crypto in a million years” Cramer has now done a complete reversal, stating that “we are big fans of Bitcoin” in a recent interview with Block CFO Amrita Ahuja. While Cramer is known to have invested in BTC in the past, in 2021, the CNBC investment pundit said  he sold most of his holdings in response to the Chinese government’s crackdown on crypto mining. A year later, he made some of his most anti-crypto comments in the immediate aftermath of the FTX scandal, when he said : “I would not touch crypto in a million years.” After one of the world’s largest centralized cryptocurrency exchanges came crashing down, Cramer berated the lack of regulation, which meant that using third-party custodians required “a lot of blind faith”. By December 2023, when Cramer was asked about the Bitcoin mining company Cleanspark on an episode  of Lighting Round, his position was less stark. He told viewers that “if you like Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin”. He also told viewers he liked BTC “for a while” but that he had since taken his profits. Unlikely that Bitcoin finds its footing — Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) January 22, 2024   Two months later, a Lighting Round viewer asked about Marathon Digital, to which Cramer responded , “I think I want to stay away from Bitcoin.” However, he added that he has “nothing bad to say” to those who choose to hold the cryptocurrency. Looking back at Cramer’s statements on Bitcoin, from “not in a million years” to being a “big fan,” the stock picker’s attitude to crypto has moved in lock step with the general market sentiment. When he condemned the entire crypto space in 2022, Sam Bankman-Fried had cast a dark cloud over the entire market. Fast-forward a year and Cramer’s remarks on Lightning Round reflected a cautious move toward acceptance by mainstream investors as Bitcoin ETFs edged closer to approval. Post-approval, with institutional Bitcoin investment surging, Cramer told Block’s Amrita Ahuja: “We are big fans of Bitcoin. We are not against it. We think it is a great store hold of value.” The store of value narrative has become central to Bitcoin’s institutional appeal. The cryptocurrency’s guaranteed scarcity has helped drive billions of dollars into BTC investment products since the start of the year. However, if history repeats itself, the price of Bitcoin may well come crashing back down in 2025. Perhaps it is even an inevitable part of the crypto market’s four-year boom and bust cycle. Conventional wisdom suggests billions of dollars of institutional money could help steady the ship. Therefore, things might not be as bad this time around. But if they are, expect Cramer to reign back his endorsement and warn against crypto investing once again."

 A British computer specialist, who accidentally lost a hard drive with 7,500 Bitcoin on it, has launched a legal bid  to persuade a local authority to let him excavate the landfill believed to house the misplaced computer. With the crypto expected to keep rising, James Howells said he wanted the chance to recover the lost coins. Howells former partner mistakenly threw away a hard drive containing 7,500 Bitcoin (BTC). Now, he has begun legal proceedings  to force Newport City Council to let him excavate a tip where, he believes, the lost cryptocurrency is buried. 📌📢In a remarkable turn of events, an early UK cryptocurrency investor, James Howells, has taken legal action in the British High Court in a bid to retrieve a hard drive containing 8,000 Bitcoins, now valued at an astonishing $538 million. — ✌𝓐𝓵𝓲𝓬𝓮✌ (@alice_chen01) March 18, 2024   A group of hedge fund investors  is reportedly backing Howells’ potentially costly legal battle. They will, as a result, receive a share of the recovered BTC if Howells is successful in his quest. Besides funding the lawsuit, the investors have also put together a team of search experts and data recovery specialists. For the past decade, Howells has been in a dispute with the Welsh local authority, seeking permission to access land to retrieve the drive. However, the authorities have consistently denied his requests. His legal representatives issued an ultimatum  last year, insisting the council let Howells start operations on the site by September 18. The cryptocurrency investor is gearing up for a legal showdown to stop the council proceeding with other projects on the land. He is also claiming damages of $557 million, which represents the highest valuation yet of the lost Bitcoin. Furthermore, he is pursuing a judicial review of the council’s decision to deny him entry to the landfill.

Howells added : “After trying everything possible for 10 years without their cooperation, the only option left is the legal path.” He expressed frustration  over the council’s refusal to seriously consider the recovery of the buried assets. He added it was “irrational” to not even discuss the matter, regardless of whether buried treasure is Bitcoin, gold, or diamonds. At the current market prices  the 7,500 BTC stored on the hard drive are worth over $525 million. However, Howells, in an interview with the Daily Mail, said he thought the value of these Bitcoins will eventually surpass a billion dollars. His main goal, he emphasized, is simply to have the chance to retrieve the lost coins. Howells stated : “Some experts believe that by the end of the year the price will rise to $25,000[0] per coin. That would make my hard drive worth £1.5 billion. The council may be happy to leave that in a landfill but I’m not. They want me to go away and forget about it but how could anyone? Why should I back down? All I want is a chance to get my property back.” Newport Council previously rejected a request  to conduct an excavation, pointing to potential adverse environmental consequences. The council has chosen not to provide additional comments on the matter."

Key Takeaways
 Over the past weekend, Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, experienced a surge, climbing 5% to $67,500. With the Bitcoin halving event just three weeks away, investors are beginning to accumulate their positions in anticipation. Famed investor and writer Robert Kiyosaki has expressed his plans to expand his Bitcoin portfolio by an additional 10 Bitcoin before April, motivated by the forthcoming halving event. Highlighting the importance of the Halving, Kiyosaki has shown  a positive stance on Bitcoin’s future potential. The author behind “Rich Dad Poor Dad” has advised those unable to afford a whole Bitcoin to buy fractions of the cryptocurrency, like 1/10 of a coin, via Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) or Satoshis. His advice reflects his conviction that even minor Bitcoin investments could lead to substantial gains over time. Kiyosaki is optimistic about Bitcoin’s structural benefits, suggesting that investors could amass an entire Bitcoin by year’s end, provided the cryptocurrency’s mechanisms function as expected. ‘Fractional investing’ allows investors to buy small portions of assets, such as stocks and ETFs, making it accessible to invest in high-priced assets without needing to purchase them outright. This concept is particularly familiar to those who have traded cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional investments, where whole units are often bought, in the crypto world, it’s common to purchase fractions of a digital currency. For instance, instead of buying an entire Bitcoin, investors can buy a quarter of a Bitcoin or even invest a specific amount, like EUR 100, to own a corresponding fraction of Bitcoin. This approach to investment democratizes access to financial markets, enabling broader participation by allowing investment in assets that might otherwise be out of reach due to high unit prices. Beyond his short-term strategy to boost his Bitcoin portfolio, Robert Kiyosaki has shared  a bullish long-term price prediction, anticipating that Bitcoin will hit $100,000 by September 2024. Moreover, Kiyosaki encourages his followers not only to invest in Bitcoin but also to diversify their investments by increasing their holdings in gold and silver, advocating for a broader approach to safeguarding their wealth. I am buying 10 more Bitcoin before April. Why? The “Having.” If you can’t afford a whole Bitcoin you may want to consider buying 1/10 of a coin, via the new ETFs or Satoshi’s. If the Bitcoin process works as designed you may own a whole Bitcoin by the end of this year.  I… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) March 25, 2024   Kiyosaki recently stated  that the 66 Bitcoin he holds will significantly increase in value, particularly as retirement funds begin to invest in spot market Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This optimistic outlook followed the approval of such ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this month, marking a significant milestone for cryptocurrency investment. The endorsement of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC is anticipated to bring a wave of institutional and retirement fund investments into Bitcoin, potentially boosting its price and market stability. Bitcoin has recently eclipsed its previous all-time high (ATH), now stabilizing near this pinnacle in a key phase for its price development. Analysts stress the critical nature of this period, advising patience as Bitcoin forms a support base around the ATH area, potentially setting the stage for an upcoming super cycle. Experts anticipate that Bitcoin will hover around the ATH for several weeks, establishing a foundation for prolonged growth and the beginning of a super cycle. This prediction is consistent with the patterns observed in past ATH breakouts, which generally see periods of lateral movement and consolidation before a major price rally. Alongside growing enthusiasm for Bitcoin, the mining difficulty has also reached its highest level ever, underscoring the increasing momentum and participation in the Bitcoin ecosystem. #Bitcoin  – What's Next?

Despite the emphasis on patience during this consolidation phase, the overall market sentiment continues to be strongly positive, bolstered by Bitcoin’s enduring resilience and sustained interest from institutional investors. Yet, investors are advised to stay alert to the market’s dynamics, as there have been instances of selling pressure from notable institutional players, such as Grayscale. This activity underscores the importance of cautious optimism and vigilance in navigating the cryptocurrency market’s complexities and potential volatility."

Key Takeaways
 As Bitcoin approaches its halving event in April 2024, investors are monitoring to see if the market will act any differently. Analyses suggest that Bitcoin has entered a critical phase which could have major implications for the year ahead. According to Rekt Capital , Bitcoin has officially entered the “Danger Zone,” characterized by historical pre-halving retracements. These retracements typically occur 14 to 28 days before the halving event. Notably, past markets have reportedly seen a 20% retracement in 2020 and a deeper 40% one in 2016. #BTC   Despite the recent bounce… Bitcoin remains firmly in the ""Danger Zone"" where historical Pre-Halving Retraces occur (orange) As a result – when it comes to downside, anything can still happen over the coming 26 days or so until the Halving$BTC  #Crypto  #Bitcoin  pic.twitter.com/tkCv8521km  — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) March 22, 2024   Bitcoin has seen some pullback after reaching an all-time high in March. Sidharth Sogani, CEO of crypto research platform CREBACO Global told CCN: “Bitcoin halving happens every 4 years, before the halving there is always a slight 20-30% correction in BTC Prices. We have witnessed 2 corrections of 15-20% each this time. There has been solid buying by ETFs. About $65 billion has been pumped into the markets by ETFs in the last 60 days.” Sumit Gupta, the co-founder of crypto exchange CoinDCX, previously told CCN that with the halving event, his company expects a potential supply shock due to increasing demand. He anticipates a combination of reduced supply and growing interest which could lead to significant momentum in the market. Meanwhile, Sogani is also bullish. He said: “Most likely in either May or June onwards Bitcoin prices will go parabolic.. and the end of the year target (before elections) is $100,000.” Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe recently drew halving parallels with the 2016/17 cycle. He noted similarities in price action, highlighting a peak occurring four weeks before the halving, followed by consolidation and a subsequent correction. Van de Poppe anticipated a gradual upward trajectory in the months following the correction, moving in accelerated growth six months later. In some way, the price action of #Bitcoin  is comparable to the 2016-2017 cycle. Peak four weeks before the halving takes place. Consolidation and another correction, after which a slow upward grind happens until acceleration 6 months later. pic.twitter.com/s68C70W76G  — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) March 22, 2024   Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures told CCN: “The cyclical nature of macro markets impacts all asset classes including crypto, and the peaking of interest rates, with a possible reduction in Fed rates in 2024, bodes well for ‘risk-on’ assets.  “Particularly for Bitcoin, there are a couple of additional forces at play, both from its inherent supply dynamics and an ongoing surge in demand from mainstream institutions via the newly launched spot BTC ETFs.” Chaturvedi emphasized that while history doesn’t always repeat itself exactly, there are often similarities. He explained that Bitcoin operates on a predetermined supply schedule, where the rewards for miners are halved after every 210,000 blocks. The upcoming halving will reduce block rewards to 3.125 BTC. Previous halving events have typically triggered bull markets because of the sudden decrease in supply.  However, this time, the halving coincides with a significant increase in institutional demand, particularly driven by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as per the investment lead. Chaturvedi added: “These demand and supply factors, coupled with decreasing interest rates, could send BTC prices higher. The markets already seem to be reacting in anticipation of the same. Spring seems to have arrived early.” Bitcoin is close to its 2024 halving event. Market observers are vigilant but bullish. Some pre-halving retracements have been recorded but, historical data explain that with a future uptrend. While there are varying commentaries on BTC price projections, the 2024 one would be a unique one due to increased institutional interest."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Luke Dashjr and the Hard Fork That Could Have Split Bitcoin,https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/luke-dashjr-hard-fork-that-could-have-split-bitcoin/,"
Key Takeaways
 In the vibrant world of Bitcoin development, where passion and outspoken opinions are commonplace, Luke Dashjr stands out as one of the most fervent figures. Recently, Dashjr has been vocal about his concerns, taking issue with memecoins and BRC-20 ordinals growing popularity. This demonstrates the clash between traditional Bitcoin values and new trends within cryptocurrency. Luke Dashjr’s personal life remains shrouded in mystery. However, some details have surfaced, notably surrounding his marital status and fatherhood. On his Twitter profile, he mentions being married and having seven children. However, he has divulged little else. His date of birth, family background, educational history, and even the identities of his spouse and offspring remain undisclosed. Dashjr fiercely protects his privacy. What is evident about Dashjr is his prolific involvement in the realm of Bitcoin and a multitude of projects throughout his time as a developer. Luke Dashjr’s career began in 2001, where he embarked on a journey of significant contributions across various projects. That year, Dashjr assumed the role of Development Leader for Kye 3.0,  a classic puzzle game originally released in 1992. He undertook a substantial rewrite, revitalizing the game for contemporary audiences. In 2002, Dashjr further demonstrated his prowess by designing a bot tailored for the XMPP distributed communications protocol. This creation garnered widespread acclaim within the community, catalyzing the development of more bots within XMPP. Transitioning into 2003, Dashjr joined the ranks of Gentoo Linux  as a developer. There, he contributed as a maintainer and ebuild writer, crafting scripts for software installation and configuration—a role he continues to perform within the Gentoo ecosystem. Beyond these endeavors, Dashjr’s footprint extends across various projects, including OpenZaurus (2005), Utopios (2003-2011), GammaMOO (2004-2012), and the House Control Automation Framework (HCAF) (2007-2012), where his contributions played pivotal roles in the evolution of these platforms. In 2010, Luke Dashjr discovered Bitcoin.  Soon afterwards, he joined its development team. His expertise allowed him to become a key developer, contributing significantly to Bitcoin’s advance during its early years. Dashjr’s initial efforts in Bitcoin were primarily directed at addressing issues related to security, performance, and the implementation of sophisticated features in Bitcoin Core. In 2011, Luke Dashjr pioneered the establishment of one of the first Bitcoin mining pools, Eligius. Remarkably, Eligius mined more than 300,000 BTC, operating without imposing any fees on its users. This meant it set a precedent in the Bitcoin mining community for its user-friendly approach. In 2012, Dashjr voiced opposition to Bitcoin’s first significant soft fork. As a result, the project’s lead developer asked him to step away. Despite this, he continued his involvement in Bitcoin development. Since 2011, he has served  as an official Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) Editor. This means he volunteers his time to scrutinize and vet proposals developers submit for evaluating modifications to Bitcoin. His role is crucial in ensuring changes to Bitcoin are thoroughly reviewed and assessed for both impact and viability. In 2013, Dashjr was among the first people to fund a critical hard fork threat  that could have split Bitcoin into two separate chains. During the contentious period known as the Block Size Wars, Dashjr devised a method to implement Segregated Witness (SegWit)  as a means to increase block size. This innovation is a key factor enabling Bitcoin to process blocks up to 4MB in size today, significantly enhancing capacity and efficiency. By 2016, Dashjr’s relentless dedication and contributions to the Bitcoin project had established him as one of the top 20 contributors worldwide, underscoring his pivotal role in the development and evolution of Bitcoin. 7/ By 2016, Luke was one of the top 20 contributors to #Bitcoin  in the world 👑 pic.twitter.com/aULIZ1aDIq  — Rizzo (@pete_rizzo_) March 21, 2024   In 2017, Luke Dashjr stood out as one of the few Bitcoin core contributors who supported the User Activated Soft Fork (UASF), a pivotal movement that led to the activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit). The success of the UASF showed, therefore, that the consensus on upgrades within the Bitcoin network is driven by its users. spot on @LukeDashjr . people who want to corporate take-over Bitcoin are anti-Bitcoin ethos and anti-Bitcoin; they are *enemies* of Bitcoin. https://t.co/wHvNjBHpbg  — Adam Back (@adam3us) October 3, 2017   Today, Dashjr continues to contribute to the Bitcoin ecosystem through his development of Bitcoin Knots , a notable alternative software implementation of Bitcoin. This highlights the importance of having multiple implementations for the Bitcoin network, which enhances the network’s decentralization and resilience. An interesting anecdote about Dashjr involves the loss of his account on Twitter. In a remarkable turn of events, after one of Dashjr’s friends found bugs in Tesla’s software, it is rumored that Elon Musk personally intervened to restore his account. In 2023, Dashjr embarked on a new venture by launching a mining pool named Ocean Mining, successfully raising $7 million. Ocean Mining distinguishes itself by minimizing its custody of funds and decentralizing mining operations. Perhaps most notably, it pays users directly, further aligning with the decentralized principles of Bitcoin.  "

Key Takeaways
 The “Mining for Power” report  by Greenpeace USA, aimed at shedding light on the connections between the Bitcoin mining industry and fossil fuel companies, has sparked considerable controversy across social media platforms. Critics of the report have leveraged community notes to highlight what they perceive as significant inaccuracies within the document. Neither Greenpeace nor Ripple responded immediately to a request for comment. Among the primary concerns raised are the allegations that the report relies on outdated information. Critics say it presents a skewed portrayal of Bitcoin mining activities. Social network users have detailed these purported factual errors, suggesting the report does not accurately reflect the current state or practices of the Bitcoin mining industry. The report claims to expose the connections  between Bitcoin mining, fossil fuel companies, and conservative lobbies. However, critics argue the 36-page document offers a misleading view. They say it claims most of the power for Bitcoin mining comes from fossil fuels. The report also says the network’s carbon footprint has grown over time. Furthermore, the report says Bitcoin’s energy demand is exerting pressure on electrical grids and driving up costs for consumers. The report by Greenpeace highlighted a “revolving door” phenomenon. It showcased connections between This depiction, however, was strongly criticized  by Daniel Batten, a managing partner at CH4 Capital and an analyst focused on the energy consumption of Bitcoin.

The crypto community has raised concerns and began scrutiny following a recent report by GreenpeaceUSA, particularly spotlighting a $5 million funding contribution from Ripple. Critics argue this was aimed at fostering fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) around Bitcoin. Ripple, known for its XRPL blockchain network, has historically not taken a direct stance against Bitcoin. It has, however, occaisionally highlighted facts favoring its own cryptocurrency , XRP, over Bitcoin. as a Bitcoin Node Operator and member of the Bitcoin High Priesthood that Controls the Protocol, I have duly considered Ripple's and Greenpeace's request to eliminate PoW from Bitcoin, and I hereby… deny it. pic.twitter.com/6QYziI2QYW  — nic 🌠 carter (@nic__carter) March 29, 2022   In a significant move in March 2022, Ripple became a part of the “Change the Code Not Bitcoin” campaign.

The primary objective of this campaign was ambitious. It sought to rally the entire Bitcoin community  behind a proposal to alter Bitcoin’s underlying code. Dear @bruneski  @chrislarsensf  @greenpeaceusa , We haven't heard back regarding collaboration. Understandable; it can feel overwhelming. I hereby offer to change the PoW code for a consultation fee of 10 BTC, thus saving 95% of your budget. P.S.

However, Daniel Batten wasn’t the only one to dispute the findings and claims made in Greenpeace’s report. Another critic, submitted a community note  challenging the report’s assertions and suggesting Greenpeace was being influenced by Ripple.

In future, the project anticipates third-party developers building their own Anduro chains too. Explaining the approach in an interview with CCN, Anduro product lead Jullian Duran emphasized that “you’re not a multichain network if you don’t go to market multichain”. He added: “We didn’t want to just release a single chain and everybody think “oh, they’re building another sidechain and it’s exactly like Liquid or Rootstock.” I want, from the get-gom everybody to understand that we want a multi-chain Layer 2 network where every kind of sidechain is accepted.” The goal, he continued, is to create a network of blockchains that all use Bitcoin as a consensus layer while remaining “experimental with the application side of things”.  ALYS is launching as Bitcoin experiences a surge of institutional interest after a prolonged crypto winter kept many corporations away. Duran said the success of spot bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) proves that large institutions want to adopt Bitcoin. However, he argued “the ecosystem doesn’t exist at a level where they can use it beyond a store of value.” As a tokenization platform that uses Bitcoin for its underlying security, ALYS creates a new institutional use case for the world’s most prominent blockchain.  While there are dozens of existing real-world asset tokenization solutions spanning every major blockchain, the world’s largest financial institutions have been slow to adopt the technology. ✴️𝐁𝐈𝐆 𝐍𝐄𝐖𝐒✴️ BOB partners with Anduro by @MarathonDH  to unveil Alys, a new institutional #Bitcoin  L2.

Jian Wen, 42, has been found guilty on one count of money laundering. She amassed a fortune of 61,000 BTC, or roughly £3 billion at its current value. This makes it the biggest cryptocurrency seizure of its kind in UK history. Reports say that, according to Wen’s declared earnings for 2017, the year alleged co-conspirator Yadi Zhang arrived in London, she had just £5,979 to her name. Within week’s of Zhang’s arrival in September that year, Wen, who was living in a flat above a Chinese restaurant in Leeds, swiftly moved into a £5 million six-bedroom house in North London. Somehow, she was suddenly able to pay £17,000 a month in rent, with six months paid upfront alongside a deposit exceeding £40,000. According to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the pair claimed to work for a prestigious international jewelry business trading diamonds and antiques across the world in countries such as Japan and Thailand, which also saw Wen purchasing properties worth more than £500,000 in Dubai in 2019. Wen had adopted a lavish lifestyle, buying luxury cars and paying for her son to attend a £6,000-a-term private school. But in typical fraudster fashion, she seemingly couldn’t stop spending. Finally, her attempts to purchase some of the most expensive properties in London, including a £23.5 million mansion, caught the attention of the authorities. After Wen tried to buy these multi-million pound properties in London, anti-money laundering (AML) checks kicked into high alert. As a result, none of the purchases were able to go ahead. Jian Wen who was found with around 61,000 Bitcoin believed to be linked to an investment fraud in China https://t.co/3yQ8UvPSfT  — Telegraph Breaking News (@TelegraphNews) March 21, 2024   Wen reportedly claimed she had earned the crypto through mining. She also said the 3,000 BTC she held was a “love present” from Zhang, who remains at large. According to reports , Zhang had fled to the UK from China using a false passport after duping some 130,000 Chinese investors out of around £5 billion with a fraudulent scheme between 2014 and 2017. Wen, however, is not alleged to have anything to do with the underlying fraud. Prosecutors say Wen was the acting “front person” to disguise the source of the funds. Wen, in her defense, said that she was “duped” and was “badly used”. Wen claimed she didn’t know the funds were the proceeds of fraud. The news arrives in a timely fashion. The UK is currently is trying to ramp up regulation efforts in a bid to prevent crypto-related crimes, frauds, or illegal and illicit usage. This includes new powers that allow authorities to seize crypto from suspect wallets without any criminal conviction. The UK Government is now on Arkham.

At the same time, it carried out a civil recovery investigation that could see the Bitcoin forfeited to authorities. The CPS said “new civil powers to recover, forfeit and convert cryptoassets are not available to the CPS”. It noted that only police and other law enforcement could use the new powers. A spokesperson said: “We can therefore not comment on how these may be used in individual cases.” The Metropolitan Police’s five-year investigation resulting in the largest cryptocurrency seizure in UK history. Detective Chief Superintendent Jason Prins, who led the investigation, said it “demonstrates how international criminals seek to exploit cryptocurrency for illegal purposes”."

Key Takeaways
 Are video platforms legally culpable when they host illegal content? The answer inevitably depends on context. But a recent San Jose appeals court ruling served a major blow to YouTube’s attempts to duck responsibility for hosting doctored videos that scammed people out of Bitcoin. The decision will give Steve Wozniak  and his co-plaintiffs a second chance to sue YouTube owner Google over videos that used his image to defraud victims using the so-called “Bitcoin giveaway” scam. Wozniak argued he suffered reputational damage because of YouTube’s failure to remove videos that used his name and image.  The scam has also used the likeness of Bill Gates and Elon Musk to convince victims to send Bitcoin with the promise that they will receive double in return.  After the Apple co-founder and 17 fraud victims initially brought their complaint against Google, a lower court ruled that the platform operator had protection under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA). But now, the court of appeals has found that YouTube may have contributed to the scam by providing verification badges to fraudulent video channels. Now, it has kicked the case back to the lower courts for reconsideration. According to Google “if a channel is verified, it’s the official channel of a creator, artist, company, or public figure”. However, Wosniak’s lawsuit alleges that channels operated by scammers received verification badges. Many of Wozniak’s arguments were dismissed on the grounds that the CDA gives Google immunity from prosecution for illegal YouTube content. However, the latest ruling suggests there is a limit to Section 230 protections. Section 230 was designed to protect internet companies from liability for content hosted on their platforms. How Section 230 protects your online freedom Section 230, part of the Telecommunications Decency Act of 1996, may sound like just any obscure piece of legislation, but it plays a crucial role in protecting your online freedom. Back in February 1996, when Section 230 became law,… pic.twitter.com/sptxyqByA2  — Students For Liberty (@sfliberty) March 19, 2024   So far, courts have interpreted the federal law as providing platform operators broad indemnity against suits for defamation, libel and other legal claims seeking to hold them responsible for what appears on their sites. However, the latest appeals court ruling acknowledges verification is a form of content moderation. This, therefore, gives it its own set of liabilities."
2024-04-15 13:21:00+00:00,Bitcoin in Japan: Will Largest Pension Fund in the World Invest in BTC?,https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/bitcoin-japan-world-largest-pension-fund-invest-btc/,"The Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) of Japan, the largest in the world, is eyeing information  on “illiquidity assets” such as Bitcoin as it looks into new investment avenues. As part of a new long-term directive to research, discover, and adopt new investment policies and diversification strategies, the fund with approximately $1.5 trillion in holdings could soon be adding crypto assets to its portfolio. As per the release  from the GPIF, the fund is looking to conduct a major research effort in response to major global changes economically, socially, and technologically. Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund is considering buying Bitcoin for diversification. It is the world's largest pension fund, with $1.5 trillion under management. Better buy it early while it's still dipping. — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) March 20, 2024   A five-year research plan is now underway with hopes of uncovering new opportunities and preparing for future changes. This includes soliciting information on low-liquid and illiquid assets currently absent from its portfolio. These include precious metals like gold and silver, as well as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The news comes as the price of BTC slumps amid what many believe to be a pre-Halving market correction. As a result, it could be an opportune entry point for investors. There is no clear indication of whether or not the GPIF will invest in Bitcoin. However, the news follows some interesting developments. Recently, a proposal  to allow institutional investors to directly hold crypto in their portfolios made its way through the government. Now, it is now up to the Japanese parliament to approve it. Though it doesn’t consider crypto to be a legitimate currency, Japan was one of the earliest to recognize the likes of Bitcoin as a means of payment and establish robust stablecoin regulations, seemingly regulating the sector without too much trouble. Most recently in February 2024, a recent push  by the Japanese government to revise economic reforms could see venture capital firms and investment funds be allowed to directly hold crypto assets. This means that the GPIF could do so. The GPIF is a government-established but independent public pension fund, as well as being the largest pension fund in the world. Therefore, it is only natural for there to be skepticism, or at least a very cautious approach when it comes to investing in volatile crypto assets. However, should the bill  pass in Parliament, crypto and Web3 overall will see a huge boost in Japan. It will also increase the potential of institutional-grade crypto investment products being created in the country. Not only that, but it should also pave the way for the GPIF to gain exposure to crypto in one way or another. A few weeks ago, known investor Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano recently took to social media to explain the current situation of public pension funds in the US, and how many have missed out on a tenfold increase. The First Public Pension Funds To Allocate To Bitcoin Are Up 10x Now I spoke this weekend at a conference focused on the intersection of economics and American leadership. Those two topics rarely go together. Economics is reserved for the nerds and politics is reserved for the… pic.twitter.com/wh3tRbUuwo  — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) March 4, 2024   In a 2018 blog post , Pomp outlined that if a fund allocated 1% of investments to Bitcoin at $4,000 per BTC, the pension’s total assets would see a 25% increase if BTC hit $100,000. Referring back to this, he highlighted  two pension plans that listened. He claimed they were the first US-based public pension funds to do so. Having reportedly bought in early 2019 for under $6,000 a piece, those funds now have 10 times their investment. The GPIF’s interest in digital assets is timely. Institutional interest is on the rise following the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. This new precedent of crypto approval is seeing a domino effect. For example, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) which is now accepting applications for institutional crypto investment products while regulators ease restrictions on institutions."

Key Takeaways
 MicroStrategy, the largest public holder of Bitcoin, has again made substantial investment in the crypto. The company has added 9,245 BTC to its portfolio, shortly after releasing an $800 million convertible offer. However, Bitcoin’s price weakness is leading MSTR stocks to trade in the red. Neverthelesss, experts predict the current bull cycle could peak by February 2025. Can MicroStrategy leverage it? MicroStrategy announced on March 19 that it has added 9,245 BTC to its portfolio. The company reportedly spent around $623 million, at an average price of roughly $67,382 per BTC. This acquisition raises MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 214,246, bought at an average price of $35,160 per coin, for a total of around $7.53 billion. The company is utilizing funds raised through convertible notes and excess cash reserves, following the announcement  of an $800 million convertible offer. MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 9,245 BTC for ~$623.0M using proceeds from convertible notes & excess cash for ~$67,382 per #bitcoin . As of 3/18/24, $MSTR  hodls 214,246 $BTC  acquired for ~$7.53B at average price of $35,160 per bitcoin. https://t.co/oeYJGgiuy0  — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) March 19, 2024   MicroStrategy’s strategy is a high-stakes bet on the future price of Bitcoin. The company’s recent acquisition, financed through convertible notes, has integrated Bitcoin into its long-term investment strategy. Convertible notes are bonds the holder can convert into a specified number of shares, in this case, of MicroStrategy. While it is a flexible financing option, will it bear fruit for the company? To put MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin gamble into perspective, consider its current holdings. It has 214,246 BTC valued at about $13.59 billion, according to data  from Bitcoin Treasuries. It also has a market capitalization of $24.05 billion at the time of writing (March 20 2024). This positions MicroStrategy’s investment at 1.8 times its net gain, occupying 56.51% of the market cap. #BTC  When Could Bitcoin Peak In This Bull Market?

In the week leading up to March 20, BTC fell by around 13%. MSTR shares are also in the red as a result. This comes weeks after MSTR stocks hit a one-year high. Analysis by Rekt Capital  suggests Bitcoin’s price could peak in the current bull market between 518 and 546 days after the halving, which is scheduled for April. However, signs of an accelerated cycle could see this timeframe halved, predicting a market peak between December 2024 and February 2025. The prediction also hinges on the trend of Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs. Bitcoin’s last peak was over $73,000, reached on March 14. MicroStrategy has positioned itself as a Bitcoin bull. So much so that the company’s market capitalization is closely tied to the crypto trajectory. While its stock remains under pressure due to Bitcoin’s recent drop below $65,000, the company could benefit from the upcoming peak. MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy is a high-risk, high-reward play. As the market looks toward the end of 2024 and early 2025 for potential peaks, MicroStrategy will be in focus."
2024-04-15 13:21:00+00:00,Bitcoin Halving: Azteco CMO David Bailey Sets the Record Straight,https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/bitcoin-halving-azteco-cmo-david-bailey-sets-record-straight/,"
Key Takeaways
 As the Bitcoin halving event approaches in mid-April, David Bailey, CMO of Azteco, stands ready to shed light on its implications from a global perspective. CCN spoke with Bailey, who offered insights into how the halving might affect market reactions, supply dynamics, price trends, adoption, the mining community, payment processing, marketplace impacts, and network security. In a discussion with CCN, Bailey shared insights on the market’s reaction to the upcoming Bitcoin halving. He noted that, similar to previous significant events like ETF approvals in the US, the halving doesn’t alter Bitcoin’s fundamental operation or long-term potential. It raises awareness and may cause a short-term price increase but doesn’t change Bitcoin’s core functionality. Bailey explained that halving affects miner rewards, potentially leading to higher network fees as block rewards decrease. He emphasized the principle of supply and demand. Bailey also suggested that Bitcoin’s price was likely to increase as new supply diminishes while demand rises. He explained: “The law of supply and demand means that since there is less new Bitcoin coming on to the market and the number of people who want it is going up, the price of Bitcoin in dollars in a rational market must go up. One of bitcoin’s super powers is that people can’t ignore supply and demand; halvings are an interesting test of the market and how efficiently it functions.” Aditionally, Bailey discussed his expectations for Bitcoin’s post-halving price movements and market reactions. He observed a significant price increase leading up to the halving. Bailey attributed this to anticipatory consumer demand rather than fundamental changes. He maintains a long-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin, emphasizing its potential for everyday payments. Bailey believes the real market movers will be broader adoption by retailers, citing the example of Pick ‘n’ Pay in South Africa accepting Bitcoin, which could have a substantial impact if mirrored by retailers in the US or Europe. Bitcoin mining will be profitable above $38k post halving. pic.twitter.com/3bIywsTwQR  — Tom Dunleavy (@dunleavy89) January 12, 2024   Bailey explored how Bitcoin’s supply dynamics and the halving might influence its price and adoption. He emphasized that the fixed long-term supply and increasing short-term demand would naturally drive the price up. He clarified that the halving would not directly affect supply or demand but would change miners’ compensation. This could, he said, leading to more expensive on-chain transactions. This shift could encourage a move towards lightning transactions, though he expects the total number of Bitcoin payments to rise, regardless of the transaction method. The number of up-to-date merchants accepting BTC cataloged by @btcmap  increased 174% in 2023. pic.twitter.com/EVHXHdmqkK  — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) January 7, 2024   Bailey went on to discuss how miners are well-prepared for the Bitcoin halving, an integral part of Bitcoin’s design. He expects no sudden changes in their business models due to the predictable nature of halving events. Over time, miners’ income will increasingly come from network fees rather than block rewards, with market dynamics balancing the supply and demand for on-chain payment processing. Bailey doesn’t foresee any significant changes to the overall network hash rate that would affect Bitcoin’s security, noting that hash rate adjustments occur every two weeks, with the effects of halving unfolding over years. He said: “The overall network hash rate is not likely to change in any way that compromises the security of the network. In fact, the hash rate for Bitcoin payment processing is already adjusted every 2 weeks or so. The impact of halving events is seen over years, not weeks.” Bailey also discussed the impact of the Bitcoin halving on payment processing, particularly for everyday transactions. He pointed out that the halving primarily affects fees for on-chain transactions. However, he noted a significant shift towards the use of the Lightning Network by consumers for its near-instant transaction speeds and minimal fees. The Azteco CMO believes that for Bitcoin to succeed long-term, it must be widely adopted for small, daily payments. As a result, he predicted an increase in transactions processed through the Lightning Network. Institutions eyeing Lightning Network for earning yield by staking Bitcoin as liquidity.

He predicts a shift towards convenient, small-scale Bitcoin purchases. Perhaps understandably, he promoted Azteco’s voucher system, which facilitates easy acquisition without the need for accounts or apps. Bailey also foresees an increase in smartphone wallet apps utilizing biometric security, enhancing user management of Bitcoin, and mentioned Bitkey’s pairing  of wallet apps with specialized fingerprint scanners. He added: “The overall network hash rate is not likely to change in any way that compromises the security of the network. In fact, the hash rate for Bitcoin payment processing is already adjusted every two weeks or so. The impact of halving events is seen over years, not weeks.”"

Key Takeaways
 Late Monday, Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a sudden crash  to $8,900 on the cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX. Meanwhile, its price on other exchanges remained stable, well above $60,000. The downturn  started at 22:40 UTC, leading to Bitcoin prices plummeting to $8,900 within two minutes, marking the lowest level since early 2020. By 22:50 UTC, the price had swiftly recovered to $67,000. Despite this dramatic fluctuation on BitMEX, Bitcoin’s global average price hovered around $67,400 during the entire episode. Observers on Twitter have suggested the price crash was triggered by significant selling by a whale. A user, @syq , reported that an individual sold more than 850 BTC (valued at around $55.49 million) on BitMEX. As a result, the XBT/USDT spot pair to plummeted to $8,900.

This pullback, one of the most substantial since the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early January, coincides with a period of unprecedented inflows into these ETFs, including a record-breaking day of over a billion dollars last week. However, a recent stabilization in these inflows has prompted a moment of reflection in the market. There’s anticipation for a phase of seeking equilibrium following the initial wave of enthusiasm, with the forthcoming week’s flow data poised to reveal traditional finance investors’ sentiment towards Bitcoin, especially in response to the recent sharp downturns.

Key Takeaways
 Standard Chartered has significantly raised its Bitcoin price forecast , now projecting that BTC could reach $150,000 in 2024. This optimistic target suggests a potential bullish outlook for Bitcoin in the coming year. This indicates the bank has confidence in its  growth. 2024 has emerged as a remarkable year for Bitcoin so far, despite experiencing a recent price correction. The excitement surrounding the approval of 11 Spot Bitcoin ETFs has been a pivotal factor, propelling the cryptocurrency to reach new heights with a record-setting price of $73,000. This development has fueled expectations for further price increases. In light of this news, Standard Chartered Bank has revised its forecast for Bitcoin. The bank now thinks it will hit $150,000 by the end of 2024. This represents a significant elevation from their previous $100,000 prediction made in November last year. Following this upward trajectory, the bank also anticipates a further increase in Bitcoin’s value in the subsequent year, underscoring a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency’s future. 🚨 BREAKING 🚨 STANDARD CHARTERED BANK HAVE RAISED ITS #BITCOIN   TARGET TO $150,000 THIS YEAR AND $250,000FOR 2025.

New #Bitcoin  price prediction in from Standard Chartered: ""For 2024, given the sharper-than-expected price gains year-to-date, we now see potential for the price to reach the $150,000 level by year-end, up from our previous estimate of $100,000."" Possible? — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) March 18, 2024   Additionally, the bank says it expects the forthcoming Bitcoin Halving event to bolster the asset’s price further. In an investor note sent via email on Monday, Standard Chartered analysts, under the guidance of Geoffrey Kendrick , revised their forecast for Bitcoin. They suggested that 2025 could see Bitcoin reach as high as $250,000, with expectations for the cryptocurrency to surpass the $200,000 threshold at various points throughout the year. This ambitious prediction is based on a comparison with gold, drawing parallels between Bitcoin’s trajectory and gold’s price movement following the US approval of gold ETFs. Kendrick and his team argue that their target price for Bitcoin is “correct” by examining the historical price dynamics of gold in relation to the introduction of gold ETFs. After that, they consider the adjustments investors might make when balancing gold and Bitcoin within their portfolios. According to the note: “We think the gold analogy – in terms of both ETF impact and the optimal portfolio mix – remains a good starting point for estimating the ‘correct’ BTC price level medium-term.” Monday – The Bitcoin vs Gold divide.

Key Takeaways
 Dave Ramsey, a personal finance expert and best-selling author, has agreed with Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett’s skeptical views on Bitcoin. Labeling the cryptocurrency as a having a value is derived from “thin air,” Ramsey addressed a question about Bitcoin on The Dave Ramsey Show. An eight-time national best-selling author with over 11 million copies sold, Ramsey, who dubs himself “America’s trusted voice on money,” took a query from a Jason in Connecticut. 🚨 🚨 Dave Ramsey sounds the alarm on #Bitcoin 's $1 Trillion market cap, deeming it ""thin air."" — Following Warren Buffett's lead, he pledges 0% investment in this realm of ""mist, smoke & mirrors""! 💥📉  🌐 With $BTC  Spot Products, The Landscape Is Rapidly Changing Companies… pic.twitter.com/GdRR2qDGWo  — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) March 14, 2024   Jason’s question was: “Can we start treating Bitcoin the same way you would treat single stocks?” Highlighting Bitcoin’s market capitalization of one trillion dollars, he argued against the notion that Bitcoin is akin to a Beanie Baby, suggesting instead that it represents a sufficiently reliable asset to justify allocating five percent of an investment portfolio to it. While Ramsey acknowledged the significant market capitalization of Bitcoin, he maintained his stance with several critical remarks. Regarding the inclusion of Bitcoin (BTC) in investment portfolios, Ramsey was quick to dismiss the idea, asserting: “No, it’s not.” He then went on to explain how gold derives its value, drawing parallels to broader concepts of value in economics. He said: “But it’s still thin air. Ask people like Warren Buffett who says if he doubled the amount he had put in Bitcoin, he would still have zero, because that’s the amount he’s put in bitcoin. I’m going with Warren on this one.” Ramsey explained that the only reason gold has value is two people agree to that value and they fought over it. According to him, that’s the only reason, the same reason that green paper has value. Therefore, commodities are exactly the same way as currencies, highlighting the fundamental agreement and conflict that underpin the valuation of commodities and currencies alike. He added: “Bitcoin … someday it may level out and become a thing, but, Jason, it’s not there. I wouldn’t wish bitcoin investments on somebody I really dislike.” Regarding the question of treating Bitcoin like a single stock, Ramsey offered his perspective. He elaborated: “No, Bitcoin is a currency. Currencies have no value except for their track record that indicates that two people are willing to fight over them.” Ramsey clarified that the value of any currency hinges on the collective belief in its worth. He also claimed that Bitcoin garnered the least confidence among currencies. He stated his investment philosophy is to avoid assets lacking a solid history of trust. Furthermore, Ramsey mentioned that he does not typically invest in currencies but would rather use them as intended. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has consistently voiced skepticism towards Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, especially against the backdrop of what some perceive as the US’s “battle” against Bitcoin. This video really puts into perspective of why we have 2 year bear markets. Like stocks, the people with 90% of the money in crypto want to buy the coins low, and lower the next year. Then it rips.

Nubank stands out as a fintech enterprise that favors Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This, in turn, marks an interesting point of contrast within Buffett’s investment landscape."

Key Takeaways
 Max Keiser, the RT host, has recently revised his Bitcoin price forecast  to $220,000, $400,000, and even $750,000  marking another adjustment since 2012. Keiser, who has been advocating for Bitcoin purchases since its price was merely $1, informed the controversial host Alex Jones that his initial estimate of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 was now considerably understated. Back in 2020, in his discussion, Keiser said: “For the first time in eight years, I am updating my Bitcoin target. Initially, when Bitcoin was at $1, I predicted it could reach $100,000. Now, I’m adjusting my target to $400,000.” Keiser, who hosted The Keiser Report on RT, made these comments as the outbreak COVID-19 loomed over global markets. On the same day, Bitcoin’s value dipped below $10,000. Despite the immediate market fluctuations, Keiser expressed unwavering confidence in Bitcoin, stating that the premier cryptocurrency remains as compelling an investment now as it was at the time of his original prediction. He said : “Bitcoin is just as appealing now at $10,000 or $9,300 as it was when it was at $100.” After that, he made a few more premonitions. The last one  was “$220,000 still in play”, positioning Keiser as one of the most bullish proponents in the Bitcoin community. But how Max Keiser became a Bitcoin legend and what ‘long and winding road’ preceded him becoming a Bitcoin millionaire? Max Keiser has been a notable figure in the Bitcoin community, known for his early advocacy and bold predictions regarding the cryptocurrency’s value. Back in 2011, just a few years after Bitcoin’s creation, Keiser’s investment in Bitcoin led to a reported gain of over 20,000,000% as the cryptocurrency surged from around $0.30 to its all-time highs​​. His long-term bullish stance on Bitcoin has been characterized by his belief in its capacity to disrupt traditional financial systems and act as a form of “resistance money” against the perceived failings of fiat currency. In a presentation in Uruguay, Keiser emphasized Bitcoin’s role in challenging and potentially replacing the inherent violence of fiat money with its peaceful nature​​ Keiser’s early coverage of Bitcoin  on mainstream media platforms and his continuous engagement with the cryptocurrency’s community have played a significant role in bringing attention to Bitcoin’s potential as both an investment and a revolutionary financial technology. His activities and predictions have been followed closely by both supporters and skeptics within the crypto space. 3/ By 2011, Max was openly discussing why #Bitcoin  was a threat to government currencies 👏 pic.twitter.com/OGw47leBN8  — Rizzo (@pete_rizzo_) March 12, 2024   Back in 2011, when Bitcoin was trading at around $1, Max Keiser made a memorable recommendation  to renowned gold investor Peter Schiff: to buy Bitcoin. Schiff, however, chose not to follow Keiser’s advice, a decision that Keiser has not let him forget, often playfully trolling him for missing out on Bitcoin’s meteoric rise. I first told @peterschiff  to buy #Bitcoin  in 2011 at $1  Then I told him again at $10 $100… https://t.co/fbDN86TXs2  pic.twitter.com/1FwZUY99Bz  — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) January 2, 2021   At the same time, Keiser boldly declared  Bitcoin “the biggest story of the decade”. This proclamation that has proven prescient as Bitcoin has indeed emerged as a major financial and technological phenomenon. 5/ In 2011, Max declared #Bitcoin  ""the biggest story of the decade."" He was right 🔥 pic.twitter.com/5Wl5SfMJaz  — Rizzo (@pete_rizzo_) March 12, 2024   This exchange and prediction underscore the dynamic debates within investment communities about the value and future of cryptocurrencies versus traditional assets like gold. In 2012, Max Keiser took the initiative to advise Tim Pool, a well-known journalist and YouTuber, to invest in Bitcoin. Heeding Keiser’s advice, Pool became not just an investor but also a staunch advocate for the cryptocurrency. By 2013, as Bitcoin’s value soared to $30, Keiser himself became one of the first Bitcoin millionaires globally. This marked a significant milestone in the digital currency’s journey. Further showcasing his belief in Bitcoin’s potential, in 2014, Keiser gifted Russell Brand , a comedian, podcaster and alleged  sex abuser, 1,000 Bitcoins. Unfortunately, Brand misplaced them, a decision that, in hindsight, cost him dearly. Those Bitcoins would be valued at approximately $70 million today. This demonstrates the volatile and unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency investments and the immense wealth generated for early adopters who held onto their assets. 8/ In 2014, Max gave podcaster Russell Brand 1,000 #Bitcoin  for free.

He further showcased his dedication to the Bitcoin cause at a conference.

Key Takeaways
 Bernstein analysts expressed  increased confidence in their forecast for Bitcoin (BTC) to reach $150,000 by mid-2025. This follows the cryptocurrency’s rally to a new all-time high earlier this week. They anticipate  that Bitcoin will experience a significant ‘breakout’ following the upcoming halving event. They also anticipate a positive outlook on the future of some Bitcoin miners, despite declining share prices. Bernstein analysts have reaffirmed  their $150,000 price target for Bitcoin, anticipating significant growth by 2025. This optimism is partly due to the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). ❖ Bernstein increasingly convinced Bitcoin price is heading towards $150,000 Bernstein sees Bitcoin's price hitting $150,000. In a note to clients this week, the firm told investors to buy Bitcoin miners as the recent underperformance ""is probably the last window before… — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) March 12, 2024   This move is expected to allow traditional investors to gain direct exposure to Bitcoin through their investment portfolios. This distinguishes it from other investment vehicles, like Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) which currently holds about 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Furthermore, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in April 2024 is predicted to favor remaining miners by reducing competition. This is because rewards for mining will be halved, thereby potentially increasing the value of Bitcoin. Despite the bullish outlook for Bitcoin, Bernstein also notes the current downtrend in mining stocks. Companies like CleanSpark, Marathon Digital, and Riot Platforms have experienced significant drops in early trading. This decline in share prices contrasts with the optimistic view of Bitcoin’s future. As a result, this suggests that mining stocks might offer a good opportunity for investors looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin. The SEC approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF is seen as a turning point that could attract substantial investment into Bitcoin, enhancing its price and consolidating its position in the market. Analysts from both Bernstein and AllianceBernstein Holding LP suggest  that this approval led to a significant inflow of funds into the Bitcoin market, driving its price to unprecedented levels. Analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra from Bernstein have highlighted  that Bitcoin mining stocks have predominantly been the domain of retail investors. Meanwhile, institutional investors have shown hesitancy towards such crypto-related investments. This because of a possible cautious and retrospective view of the cryptocurrency market. However, with Bitcoin’s price reaching new heights of $72,000 , they anticipate a shift in institutional interest towards bitcoin equities, particularly benefiting Bitcoin miners. Everyone wants to pump Bitcoin mining stocks at the end of the cycle. $MARA  about $20 and $RIOT  $11. If they go higher it's on short covering and pumps. The mcap doesn't support the Bitcoin they own at this level. It assumes already Bitcoin at much higher levels! — 🔋Readytogo123🔋🐇 (@Readytogo1231) March 12, 2024   They argue that the uptrend in Bitcoin’s value and transaction fees will offer substantial support to miners heading into the next halving event. Specifically, Riot Platforms and CleanSpark could achieve gross margins of approximately 70% and 60%, necessitating patience from investors betting on Bitcoin miners. As Bitcoin’s rally continues, mining stocks have not seen the same level of performance. Currently, investors seem to prefer to “long bitcoin and short miners”. The strategy reflects a preference for spot ETFs as a safer investment option compared to mining stocks, which carry increased risks due to the anticipated impact of the upcoming halving event on their profitability. On Tuesday, Bitcoin’s price was mostly flat , reaching approximately $72,160. This divergence shows the cautious approach of investors who aim to mitigate uncertainties associated with halving by opting for more direct exposure to Bitcoin through ETFs. While the approval of Bitcoin ETFs has generated significant excitement, it’s essential to acknowledge the persistent regulatory challenges and macroeconomic pressures facing the cryptocurrency industry. The sector continues to operate in a regulatory grey area, striving to strike a balance between innovating and protecting customers. High-profile legal actions by the SEC against leading crypto exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, underscore the regulatory hurdles that remain. Furthermore, the broader economic environment, characterized by rising interest rates and ongoing inflation, poses challenges to all asset classes. These factors could deter new investment and influence the crypto market’s growth trajectory, as potential investors might seek perceived safer assets. Volume trends and investor sentiment point towards a cautious approach, as Bitcoin navigates critical resistance levels amidst varying macroeconomic pressures. Technical analysis suggests the upcoming sessions could be pivotal in establishing short to mid-term trajectory. — FireAccount (@_fireaccount_) January 16, 2024   Despite the growth and positive developments in the digital asset space in recent months, investors should remain vigilant and informed about the evolving investment landscape, considering both the opportunities and the risks involved."
2024-04-11 14:24:00+00:00,Oil Prices Climb: Finding the Bitcoin Connection,https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/oil-prices-bitcoin/,"
Key Takeaways
 Crude oil prices hit a four-month high but the ripple effects are being felt far beyond the energy markets. The recent surge in oil prices is down to a range of factors including market predictions, inventory shifts, and geopolitical tensions. Meanwhile, studies have shown that it has a connection to the crypto market as well, specifically to Bitcoin. Oil prices have ascended  to their highest in four months, driven by many factors. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has revised its oil demand growth forecast for 2024 upwards. The EIA predicts that in 2024, people around the world will need 1.3m more barrels of oil every day compared to now. This is a bit more – 110,000 barrels daily – than what they thought last month. The US is now the largest producer of crude oil and that changes geopolitics forever. No need to secure oil elsewhere, less appetite to be the global police patrolling the oceans. Source: https://t.co/VgzLBEjmyy  pic.twitter.com/1J4HWBHMqG  — Simon Kuestenmacher (@simongerman600) March 15, 2024   Additionally, unexpected drops in US crude and gasoline inventories, coupled with the impact of Ukrainian attacks on Russian refineries, which reduced Russia’s refinery capacity by 12%  in a single day, have all contributed to the price hike. The complex interplay of supply, demand, and geopolitical dynamics is pushing oil prices up. Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell, a global leader in oil, gas, and petrochemicals, has warned  of potential global energy shortages if investments in oil and gas drilling don’t rise. The energy giant also highlighted that current global investment in low-carbon energy sources is only half of what is necessary, suggesting the risk of future energy shortages unless alternative sources are further developed. Interestingly, this surge in oil prices has implications for the Bitcoin market. A study  previously highlighted how higher oil prices increase the cost of Bitcoin production, thereby potentially lowering its returns and increasing volatility. This is because Bitcoin mining, the process by which new Bitcoins are created, is energy-intensive. Also, rising oil prices can make it more expensive to operate the massive computer networks needed for mining. After operating flawlessly for 15 years and appreciating millions of percent in dollar terms, Bitcoin is down $5,000 from 36 hours ago and several sources on X are now saying it’s “over” and “dead”. Can anyone confirm? I haven’t always found influencers on X to be super reliable — Mike Alfred (@mikealfred) March 15, 2024   The study also points out investors who consider oil price movements in Bitcoin investment strategies may achieve higher gains. Therefore, there is a link between the traditional energy sector and the emerging digital currency market. Bitcoin’s price has seen a decline of 4% on March 15 aligning with the study’s findings that rising oil prices can have a dampening effect on Bitcoin returns. As pointed out by the study, investors who keep an eye on oil prices while making decisions about Bitcoin investments are likely to see better outcomes than those who don’t pay attention to oil price changes. When the price of oil rises, it can lead to higher overall costs and inflation. This reduces people’s real income and, as a result, decreases confidence in the economy. This situation could also make Bitcoin more attractive as an investment, as people look for ways to protect their money against the instability caused by rising oil prices. With a BTC price under $70,000 the global Bitcoin network hashrate stands  at 555.85 EH/s and a mining difficulty of 83.95. The energy market’s fluctuations have far-reaching implications. Therefore, people who make investment strategies can the rise in oil to to Bitcoin. This is especially the case now that Bitcoin has gained a mainstream status by receiving institutional backing."

Key Takeaways
 President Nayib Bukele announced  on Thursday that El Salvador plans to move “a substantial portion” of its Bitcoin holdings offline. A device will be securely stored in a physical vault located within the Central American nation’s borders. On Thursday, President Nayib Bukele revealed that El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio is worth around $407 million. El Salvador still needs to completely reveal the exact size of its holdings. However, the recent surge in Bitcoin’s value has renewed global interest in the cryptocurrency. We've decided to transfer a big chunk of our #Bitcoin  to a cold wallet, and store that cold wallet in a physical vault within our national territory. You can call it our first #Bitcoin  piggy bank 🇸🇻 It's not much, but it's honest work 😂 pic.twitter.com/dqzedykxT1  — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) March 14, 2024   According to Bitcoin explorer Mempool , the wallet presently displays a Bitcoin balance valued at $388 million. Nevertheless, just a few hours following El Salvador’s declaration, Bitcoin enthusiast filled the wallet with “rare sats” and Ordinals. According to Ordiscan , the wallet now holds a minimum of 67 Ordinals donations. These contributions include BRC-20 tokens and text inscriptions, images, a 3D “runestone,” and notably, a copy of the “Cypherpunk Manifesto .” Written by Eric Hughes in March 1993, this advocates for the protection of privacy through encryption. The wallet has also received around $700 in donations in the form of satoshis, some of which are “pizza” and “vintage” sats. Pizza sats trace back by early Bitcoin contributor Laszlo Hanyecz. In May 22, 2010, he used 10,000 BTC to buy two Papa John’s pepperoni pizzas, the first ever BTC real-world transaction. Vintage sats, meanwhile, are those mined within the first 1,000 blocks of Bitcoin’s existence. In total, El Salvador’s new wallet address has had 56 transactions, with the bulk of these transactions being of small value. Gerson Martínez, a strategist at the Salvadoran Bitcoin mining project Volcano Energy, expressed admiration  for the Bitcoin community on a March 15 post on X, noting the influx of donations to El Salvador’s cold wallet. Gotta love bitcoiners. Donations rolling in to El Salvador's cold wallet 🔥🔥🔥. https://t.co/kniA1T6TGH  pic.twitter.com/mpQxtOGpHU  — Gerson Martínez 🟧 ⛏️ (@gersonmartinez) March 15, 2024   The wallet accumlated its balance of 5,689 BTC through multiple transactions. Initially, 1,120 BTC valued at $76.5 million were transferred on March 13, authorized by a 3/5 multisignature mechanism, with the approval of four signatories as reported by Mempool . The most significant transaction involved the transfer of 4,000 BTC, equivalent to $273 million, which took place at 9:38 pm UTC on March 14, roughly two hours following President Bukele’s announcement. In September 2021, El Salvador made history by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin  as legal tender, placing it on equal footing with the US dollar. Regarding the initiative to transfer a significant portion of the country’s Bitcoin assets to an offline wallet, President Nayib Bukele remarked, “It’s not much, but it’s honest work.” This week, Bitcoin’s value briefly soared above $73,000 before experiencing a pullback. This surge followed American authorities’ decision to make access to the cryptocurrency easier for investors. Alongside Bitcoin, other digital currencies, like Ethereum, have also seen their prices climb. Despite this, a January survey by Central American University (UCA) revealed  88% of Salvadorans did not use Bitcoin in 2023. Bukele’s administration has promoted the use of Bitcoin, aiming to cut the cost of overseas remittances and increasing financial inclusion among Salvadorans, 70% of whom are unbanked."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Bitcoin Price Drops – But What Next?,https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/bitcoin-price-drops-what-next/,"
Key Takeaways
 During the Asian trading session on Friday, March 15, Bitcoin’s value  dropped to a low of $67,000, marking a 7% decrease, before it climbed back up to approximately $68,500. According to CoinGlass , there hass been a significant impact on the market. More than $100 million in long positions were erased in the past 12 hours. Meanwhile, longs worth $167 million were liquidated over the course of the last 24 hours. Bitcoin is one of many cryptocurrencies that slipped. This week has also seen pressure on other assets, including gold  and the Nasdaq,  Wall Street’s technology-centric index. So far this year, enthusiasts bullish on Bitcoin have been relieved from closely monitoring economic indicators and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies, thanks to the strong demand for the cryptocurrency spurred by new spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). However, this trend is beginning to shift. Th eUS Producer Price Index  (PPI) for February, released on Thursday morning, offered further evidence that inflation remains more persistent than anticipated. According to the American government’s report, the PPI increased by 0.6% last month, a rate that not only doubled January’s pace but also exceeded economists’ predictions by twice the amount. The core PPI, which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy, saw a rise of 0.3% in February. While this represents a deceleration from January’s 0.5% increase, it still surpassed the expected 0.2%. “It has been a trying January & February when it comes to the inflation numbers,” says #CNBC ’s @steveliesman  after the latest PPI report came in a bit hotter-than-expected. pic.twitter.com/Dmq85jyI7Q  — CNBC's Closing Bell (@CNBCClosingBell) March 14, 2024   At the beginning of this week, the US Consumer Price Index  (CPI) also reported higher-than-expected figures, indicating an acceleration in inflation to an annual rate of 3.2%. Moreover, the core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy prices, climbed to 3.8%. After nearly falling below the 4% mark earlier in the month, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has now increased  to 4.30%. Concurrently, the US dollar has reversed a downward trend that started in mid-February, gaining about 1% over the last week, which includes a 0.5% increase on Thursday. Generally, higher interest rates and a strengthening dollar are considered unfavorable for risk assets such as Bitcoin (BTC). Expectations for a significantly more lenient monetary policy in 2024 are being steadily scaled back. At the start of the year, the markets anticipated up to 150 basis points in rate reductions from the Federal Reserve in 2024, with the first cut expected to occur at the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting next week. However, analysts have now adjusted their expectations, with no rate cut anticipated at next week’s meeting or even in May. Looking towards June, the likelihood of a rate decrease has dwindled to approximately 50%, as per the CME FedWatch Tool.  Following a surge of approximately 70% in 2024, reaching a new all-time high just below $74,000, Bitcoin inevitably faced a potential correction. The recent developments concerning inflation, interest rates, and the strength of the dollar may have provided traders with a reason to reduce their positions. After reaching a peak of $73,800 earlier on Thursday, Bitcoin’s value declined  to as low as $70,650 following the release of economic data. At the time of writing (March 15 2024), it was trading at $68,439, marking a decrease of more than 6.6% over the past 24 hours. #BTC  : High $73830 so far and now some pull back. Support now at $66590 & $64900 and if hold then once again price will cross $69970 and towards $76500. #Bitcoin  pic.twitter.com/zFms7fH3y0  — Mind Trader (@mindandtrading) March 15, 2024   Some Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that Bitcoin’s scarcity contributes to its value. The principle is straightforward. If the supply of a commodity decreases, then, assuming all else remains constant, its price should increase as demand continues. Therefore, a reduction in Bitcoin’s supply should, potentially, elevate its price, according to some analysts and traders. This logic is, however, contested by others who argue that its current price would already reflect any such impact. Crypto miners significantly influence the availability of Bitcoin in the market. However, this sector remains shadowy, with limited data on inventory and supply levels. Should miners decide to liquidate their reserves, this could exert downward pressure on Bitcoin prices. ❓ What's the reason for #BTC 's sharp price drop? The reason for the decline on the #BTC  side was associated with the sales pressure created by miners. The fact that #Bitcoin  halving'll take place next month makes #miners  uneasy.#binance  #ETF  1/2: — Tutunamayanlar (@Tutunamay4nlar) March 15, 2024   Understanding the drivers behind a cryptocurrency rally is challenging, especially given the lack of transparency in the crypto market about who is buying and why, a stark contrast to more traditional markets. The primary catalyst for this year’s Bitcoin surge is almost certainly the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January. However, the anticipation of interest rate cuts by central banks is also a factor. However, in the speculative realm of cryptocurrency trading, analysts’ explanations for fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price can quickly morph into market narratives. These narratives, in turn, may become self-fulfilling, influencing the market’s direction and investor behavior. After #halving , network difficulty'll increase and block rewards will be halved. Therefore, #miners 'll go through difficult processes. Miners who don't want to make a loss or want to create cash capital have started to sell the #BTC  they scraped.#binance  #bitcoin  2/2: — Tutunamayanlar (@Tutunamay4nlar) March 15, 2024   There is no conclusive evidence  to suggest that previous Bitcoin halvings have directly led to an increase in Bitcoin’s price. However, traders and miners have analyzed historical halving events in an attempt to gain a strategic advantage. Following the most recent halving on May 11, 2020 , Bitcoin’s price saw an approximate 12% increase in the subsequent week. Later in the year, Bitcoin embarked on a significant rally, attributed to various factors such as relaxed monetary policies and an influx of retail investors driven by pandemic-induced lockdowns, rather than the halving itself. Similarly, a halving in July 2016  resulted in a modest 1.3% price increase in the week that followed. Nevertheless, the price dropped a few weeks later. Determining the exact influence of halvings on Bitcoin’s price is challenging. This, in turn, makes it difficult to predict the outcomes of future halvings. Regulatory bodies have consistently cautioned that Bitcoin operates within a speculative market, susceptible to hype and the “Fear Of Missing Out” (FOMO), posing significant risks to investors. Despite these warnings, regulators continue to authorize Bitcoin trading products."

Key Takeaways
 Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, has reignited discussions about financial stability and discipline in the context of the United States’ escalating national debt. Armstrong notes that the adoption of Bitcoin could represent a contemporary return to the gold standard by injecting a much-needed sense of financial restraint. With upcoming presidential elections in the US, fiscal deficit has become a bipartisan issue. Armstrong draws a comparison on the historical precedent of the gold standard. The US abandoned the standard, where the value of currency was backed by a specific amount of gold, in 1971. Its supporters claimed the standard provided a check on rampant government spending and printing of money. According to the Coinbase CEO, Bitcoin offers a modern parallel to the concept with its fixed supply and decentralized nature. According to Armstrong, embracing Bitcoin could serve as an “important check and balance on excessive deficit spending,” essential for maintaining the strength of the US economy. This is (in part) why Bitcoin matters. It’s a return to the gold standard that we left fully in 1971. A return to financial discipline. Bitcoin will be an important check and balance on excessive deficit spending which is essential to the U.S. and the dollar remaining strong. https://t.co/u4mN5SgPTX  — Brian Armstrong 🛡️ (@brian_armstrong) March 12, 2024   The national debt represents the total amount of money the government owes, accumulated over decades of spending. Investor Robert Sterling’s analysis paints a vivid picture of the debt’s exponential growth. He claimed the problem was not down to a single party but was a result of actions taken by multiple administrations. Also, he said that debt had grown more rapidly in recent years. According to the Bank of America, the US is adding approximately $1 trillion to its total every 100 days, signaling an unsustainable fiscal trajectory. Sterling claimed national debt was “not slowing down”. He added: “Biden has another 300 or so days in office this term. When either he or Trump enters their second respective term in office in 2025, the debt will likely be above $37 trillion.” At the time of writing, the total US national debt is standing at  $34.5 trillion. It represents the cumulative borrowing by the Federal Government of the United States throughout its history. The surge in national debt is attributed to a variety of factors, including military expenditures and efforts to stimulate the economy during crises such as the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. With the upcoming elections, there’s increased scrutiny on how both Joe Biden and Donald Trump plan to address the national debt. Bloomberg quoted  Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard University, who warned that both candidates are pushing US debt to risky levels. “Omega candles aren’t possible.” US national debt is rising by $1 trillion dollars every 100 days. That’s 100 Omega candles a day. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) March 14, 2024   Rogoff told Bloomberg TV: “Washington has a very relaxed attitude towards debt that I think they’re going to be sorry about.” Furthermore, government spending, particularly on the military and overseas aid, has reached  9.3% of GDP in the last four years. Meanwhile, BoA data indicates higher expenditures than ever before. Brian Armstrong’s comments spark a crucial conversation on how the US might tackle its growing debt crisis.By drawing parallels to the gold standard, Armstrong suggests a pathway to restraint through Bitcoin. Regardless, anything that counters the current trajectory of unchecked fiscal expansion in the US could help matters. But as the national debt continues to rise, the concept of a digital gold standard in the form of Bitcoin presents an argument."

Key Takeaways
 El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, has enacted a significant reform to its tax legislation. The country’s Legislative Assembly has passed a measure to cut income tax  on foreign investments and remittances from 30% to 0% without imposing any restrictions on the amount involved. On March 12, President Nayib Bukele announced  that Congress had amended the country’s income tax law. Congress has reformed our income tax law, for international investments and money transfers, dropping the rate from 30% to 0%.

The post said : “With 69 votes in favor, we reform the Income Tax Law so that family remittances or any capital from abroad is introduced into the country free of payment of this tax, regardless of the amount.” #Plenaria148 ✍🏻 Con 69 votos a favor, reformamos la Ley del Impuesto Sobre la Renta para que las remesas familiares o cualquier capital proveniente del extranjero sea introducido al país libre del pago de este tributo, sin importar el monto. pic.twitter.com/7dZf5IyZJg  — Asamblea Legislativa 🇸🇻 (@AsambleaSV) March 13, 2024   Since Nayib Bukele’s election in 2019, El Salvador has undergone a significant transformation. In 2021, Bukele made Bitcoin legal tender  and added 200 BTC to the national treasury. Following these changes, El Salvador’s economy has grown. According to the World Data Bank , its gross domestic product (GDP) was $24.9 billion in 2019. This rose to $32.4 billion by 2022, with projections showing a 2.8% growth in 2023. Recent reports from CCN highlight that El Salvador’s 2021 Bitcoin investment has yielded an $85 million profit since Bitcoin’s price broke past the $72,000 mark in the week of March 10. Bukele secured reelection on February 4, winning more than 85% of the vote. El Salvador’s recent tax code adjustment is yet another new economic policy from the Central American country, following a move in April 2023. This earlier initiative saw El Salvador removing all taxes  related to technological innovation, including income, property, capital gains, and import duties taxes, for a period of 15 years. The Law for the Promotion of Innovation and Technology Manufacturing aims to to foster an environment conducive to the tech sector’s growth. The legislation covers such areas as software and application programming, artificial intelligence (AI), and computer and communication hardware manufacturing​​​​. ‼️🇸🇻 El Salvador’s President, Nayib Bukele :  “Your TAX money is NOT funding your government.  Your government is funded by printing money out of thin air.  So, if your central bank is printing money to fund the government, then WHY do we need to pay taxes?"" 🤔 pic.twitter.com/0JTRuFmqBD  — Radar🚨 (@RadarHits) March 13, 2024   This shift aims to attract global talent and investment. As a result, there is speculation El Salvador could become a potential hub for technology on the international stage. El Salvador’s tax-free status seeks to revolutionize its local tech industry and expand job opportunities for its citizens. For instance, this approach has already begun to draw interest from major companies and startup incubators looking to invest."

Key Takeaways
 On March 12, Canadian rapper Drake shared MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor’s optimistic remarks  about Bitcoin to his 146 million Instagram followers. The post included Saylor’s prediction that Bitcoin will overtake gold as the leading store of value. In the 2021 bull market, endorsements and promotions by celebrities played a key role in attracting new people to cryptocurrencies. A notable instance involved comedian Larry David starring in a Super Bowl advertisement for FTX, where he encouraged viewers to adopt cryptocurrency. However, following the collapse of FTX in 2022, he later expressed regret over his broad support for the platform. This week, on Instagram, Drake reshared a clip from the account “bitcoin_memes_daily,” featuring a video  captioned “Michael Saylor on Bitcoin.” Drake is posting Bitcoin memes on Instagram Retail is officially back pic.twitter.com/6cmVbRQ19A  — LilMoonLambo (@LilMoonLambo) March 12, 2024   Drake sharing Saylor’s remarks suggests the involvement of celebrities could once again heighten interest in cryptocurrencies. During a Monday interview with CNBC, Saylor advocated for Bitcoin, asserting its qualities surpass gold’s as a store of value. Saylor said Bitcoin was digital, easily transferable, and more securely protectable than precious metals. He commented: “The world needs a perfect store of value; Bitcoin is the perfect store of value.” Though Drake’s post didn’t explicitly endorse investing, his choice to share Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin remarks with his vast following suggests a favorable outlook for the cryptocurrency sector. On March 11, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, exceeding $70,000, positioning the digital currency on track to become the world’s most valuable asset. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy has reinforced its Bitcoin investment. The organisation purchased an additional 12,000 BTC for approximately $821.7 million, at an average price of $68,477 per coin. MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 12,000 BTC for ~$821.7M using proceeds from convertible notes & excess cash for ~$68,477 per #bitcoin . As of 3/10/24, $MSTR  hodls 205,000 $BTC  acquired for ~$6.91B at average price of $33,706 per bitcoin. https://t.co/YayyKtpz8d  — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) March 11, 2024   By March 12, 2024, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin portfolio had grown to BTC, valued at more than $6.91 billion. The company paid an average of $33,706 per BTC. The pattern of increased celebrity endorsements in the crypto world often signals the onset of bull market cycles. This trend has not only captivated a broad audience but has also attracted regulatory attention due to the potential for misleading promotions. Notably, celebrities like Lindsay Lohan, Floyd Mayweather, Jake Paul, and Matt Damon have faced regulatory scrutiny  after promoting various cryptocurrency projects. Such promotional activities have occasionally led to controversies, exemplified by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) taking action against eight celebrities for endorsing cryptocurrencies like Tronix (TRX) and BitTorrent (BTT) without revealing the compensation received. The SEC is charging a handful of celebrities for boosting crypto assets without disclosing their endorsements. (@latimes ) Names include:  – Lindsay Lohan– Jake Paul– Soulja Boy – Lil Yachty– Ne-Yo– Akon pic.twitter.com/hSyUzRFehh  — Morning Brew ☕️ (@MorningBrew) March 22, 2023   One notable incident involved Kim Kardashian. The reality TV star settled with the SEC  for over $1.2 million after illegally promoting EthereumMax’s crypto security on social media without disclosing her payment. Despite these incidents, prominent personalities such as Elon Musk and Paris Hilton have openly shared their Bitcoin investments. Drake’s recent emphasis on Saylor’s view of Bitcoin could potentially act as an indicator for both new investors to consider entering the market. His influence suggests that retail investor enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies might be reigniting, potentially heralding a new phase of market activity."

Key Takeaways
 Following a historic $1 billion influx  into US-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on March 12, Bitcoin’s price sustained its recent surge. The leading digital currency reached a new peak  of $73,750.07 on March 14, causing substantial losses exceeding $100 million for traders who speculated on its price in the last 24 hours. BitMEX Research data  reveals that net inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs exceeded $1 billion on March 12. Specifically, the inflow amount recorded that day reached $1.04 billion, setting a record for the largest single-day inflows since these investment products began trading on January 11.

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the pack with the most significant inflow, attracting $849 million. This surge increased the total assets under management (AUM) in the IBIT fund to $15.42 billion, positioning it second only to Grayscale Investments’ Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), which has $27.68 billion in assets. 🚨 BTC #ETF  Net Inflow Mar 13, 2024: +$684M • The net inflow dropped by 38.3% compared to the previous day but remains the second-largest inflow per day since ETF inception. • The cumulative total net inflow after 43 trading days is $11.82B. • BlackRock ($IBIT) now holds… https://t.co/hziFc5Uy4v  pic.twitter.com/DGsnfVecZF  — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) March 14, 2024   Following IBIT, the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) also experienced substantial inflows. ARKB received $93 million, while HODL recorded an inflow of $82.9 million. VanEck’s ETF emerged as the third most popular option after the firm announced a sponsor fee waiver of 0.20%  until March 31, 2025, or until the fund reaches its first $1.5 billion in assets under management (AUM). Currently, the fund’s AUM stands at $515 million. Fidelity’s FBTC was the fourth Bitcoin ETF to experience significant inflows, attracting $51.6 million and bringing its total AUM to around $9.2 billion. Despite the overall trend of inflows, Grayscale Investments’ Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) continued to see funds leaving, albeit at a reduced rate. On March 12, GBTC experienced an outflow of $79 million, which was significantly lower than the record $494 million outflow witnessed the previous day. The remarkable increase in ETF inflows coincides with Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Following the break above its 2021 ATH, Bitcoin has set new records in the past eight days. The most recent ATH, recorded on March 13, stands at $73,637. Despite the upcoming halving being just a few weeks away, Bitcoin has continued to soar to new all-time highs. Amid this impressive performance, crypto enthusiast Samson Mow has stated that Bitcoin’s price run has yet to truly begin. In a recent discussion, Mow told CCN: “I would say there’s a massive amount of growth. If you look at the state of Bitcoins infrastructure today with lightning, with liquid. We have a very robust ecosystem of different and unique ways to scale Bitcoin and if you look at it from a monetary perspective of Bitcoin and as an asset class, we have the ETFs now that have billions of dollars in AUM and I would say overall everything is very healthy.”"

Key Takeaways
 In a recent episode  of the Impact Theory podcast, listeners were treated to a discussion that delved into finance and digital currencies. Economists and investment experts Raoul Pal and Peter Schiff engaged in a head-to-head discussion . The pair discussed Bitcoin, the state of the economy, and the prospective future of financial systems. Raoul Pal, a former hedge fund manager who retired at 36, was matched against Peter Schiff, a Wall Street veteran known for his accurate predictions regarding market performance. The conversation covered a wide array of topics, reflecting on the fundamental debate over value versus price, the ominous possibility of a currency collapse, and Bitcoin’s enticing allure compared to the traditional gold standard. Discussions also ventured into how the upcoming 2024 election could influence market dynamics, the potential of AI to solve economic challenges, and various strategies for preparing for hyperinflation or financial repression. Additionally, the debate touched on the impact of volatile markets on asset values. It also considered the looming issue of national debt and possible hyperinflation, historical instances of financial repression, the innovative potential of blockchain technology, and the uncertain future of Social Security. Pal said he would reconsider his stance if Bitcoin’s network activity and adoption decreased, signaling a loss in value. Schiff remained skeptical. His opinions remain unchanged, despite Bitcoin’s price fluctuations and lack of widespread transactional use. Pal says a significant decline in Bitcoin’s network activity and interest could signal its failure as a store of value, similar to gold’s challenges in the digital era. He emphasized that if Bitcoin’s usage, transaction volume, and new adopter rates fall persistently, it might indicate inherent issues with the network’s viability, despite increasing adoption during market downturns, which suggests resilience against short-term price fluctuations. He talked about significant downturns in the cryptocurrency market. Onr downturn prompted him to question whether it signaled a cessation in adoption or was merely a part of the natural business cycle. Despite these substantial losses, Pal remains optimistic about the future, suggesting that the digital and blockchain adoption trends would continue to grow, underscoring his belief in the enduring appeal and utility of digital currencies and blockchain technology in the years ahead. 🎯 RAOUL PAL ➡️ "" WE ARE REALLY, REALLY EARLY STILL"" #BITCOIN  @RaoulGMI   ➡️ ""THIS NEXT WAVE IS WAY BIGGER […]""➡️ IT´S LIKE A SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLE OF #RIA  ALLOCATIONS ➡️THESE GUYS ARE NETWORKS AND THEY CONVINCE THEIR CLIENTS ABOUT AN X-PERCENT ALLOCATION➡️ THEY START WITH… https://t.co/yNMotR3HuL  pic.twitter.com/4GxqOoindD  — XRP DROPZ (@DROPZXRP) March 12, 2024   Schiff, on the other hand, remains skeptical about Bitcoin’s practical use and widespread adoption, despite its price fluctuation from a few dollars to $60,000. He notes minimal real-world transaction use within his business and recalls the fade of initial corporate interest in Bitcoin transactions. Schiff contrasted Bitcoin’s volatility and speculative nature with its initial promise of banking system independence and privacy. Dan Tapiero’s view of Bitcoin as a “security truth machine” and a solution to trust issues in financial systems offers a different perspective, however. Schiff highlighted the speculative nature of Bitcoin, expressing concern over its volatility and questioning the sustainability of its value. He pointed out the possibility of Bitcoin’s price fluctuating significantly, noting that it could rise from $60,000 to $100,000, $1 million, or fall to $10,000 or lower. True #Bitcoin  believers didn't wait over a decade to buy Bitcoin through an ETF. In fact, they don't even want a third party holding their keys. That means the next crypto winter will be an ice age, as those ETF speculators who came late to the party refuse to ride out the storm. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) March 13, 2024   He noted the uncertainty of Bitcoin’s future performance despite its history of recovery. it with speculative investments in gold stocks, which he considers based on their perceived undervaluation. Peter Schiff criticized the government’s method of indirectly taking money from its citizens by creating money out of thin air, which he equated to a form of taxation that reduces purchasing power​​. He said: “Instead of taking your money by taxing you openly and directly or even indirectly through a sales tax, [the government] surreptitiously robs you of your purchasing power by just creating money out of thin air, usually with a complicit central bank.” Raoul Pal talked about the diminishing performance of gold  against the backdrop of global currency debasement. Schiff also expressed skepticism towards Bitcoin as an alternative to traditional currencies. Meanwhile, Pal questioned the future economic value in a world increasingly dominated by AI and automation. @PeterSchiff  You're not thinking about the consequences of this clearly. Why would the AI companies offer their services to us to use? We wouldn't be able to offer anything of value in return that their AI couldn't do for them. They also wouldn't simply allow us to be either… pic.twitter.com/twZUY4ZLhW  — Trevor Wood (@trevorwood222) March 13, 2024   Pal said: “What’s harder is to say, what the hell does an economy mean after 2030, when you’ve got endless AI and robots and AGI? What what value do you provide in that world?” Schiff further highlighted the tension between government-induced inflation  and the market tendency toward price reduction through productivity gains, particularly from advancements in AI and robotics. He critiqued the reliance on quantitative easing and inflationary policies. Schiff also warned of a financial reality check once it becomes clear these measures cannot be sustained indefinitely. He commented: “Our ability to stimulate with QE, with inflation is predicated on the false belief that the fed could shrink the balance sheet, withdraw the liquidity, normalize interest rates, we can pay off the debt. When the markets come to the unfortunate realization that that’s not true, then the bottom drops out and we can’t kick the can down the road anymore because there’s no more road.” Pal, on the other hand, emphasized the importance of adapting our mental models to the evolving world. He went on to acknowledge the potential for both success and error in our predictions. He added: “I just urge all of us to just make sure that we don’t get obsessed by our own mental models. They will change, and the world changes. Sometimes we can be dead wrong, and sometimes we can be dead right.”  "

But that’s not to say that the nation will be launching domestic crypto ETFs. Instead, it will only allow institutional and “ultra-high-net-worth” entities to invest in spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs on US exchanges. According to  the Bangkok Post , Thailand’s SEC has adjusted its rules. As a result, Thai asset management firms can now launch private funds and invest in spot Bitcoin ETFs. 🇹🇭Thailand's SEC has updated its regulations, allowing investment in spot #Bitcoin  ETFs traded on U.S. exchanges.  This move, initially available to institutional and high net worth investors, marks a significant shift in Thailand's approach to #cryptocurrencies . — Satoshi Talks (@Satoshi_Talks) March 12, 2024   Following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, the investment product became defined as a security instead of a digital asset, allowing Thai securities firms to invest. Coupled with the accelerating price in BTC, Thai investors were urging regulators to give them access to digital assets. SEC secretary-general, Pornanong Budsaratragoon said: “Asset management firms asked the SEC for them to have exposure in digital assets, especially Bitcoin and spot Bitcoin ETFs.” Emphasizing the diligence undertaken by the SEC, he added: “We need to consider carefully whether to allow asset management firms to allow asset management firms to invest in digital assets directly due to the high risk.” In short, the decision enables a select group of sophisticated Thailand-based investors to invest in BTC through regulated channels. This, in turn, could be the beginnings of a bustling crypto sector in the country. There appears to be some intention to create clarity around crypto, as well as enable its growth in Thailand. This is timely, given that BTC is breaking records once again. $71,924.80#Bitcoin  #BTC  $BTC  $USD  — Bitcoin (@Bitcoin) March 12, 2024   Other rule changes from the SEC come just a few months after Thailand’s Finance Ministry decided to remove value-added tax  (VAT) from digital asset trading. The new tax exemption, which removes a 7% VAT obligation from crypto trading, is a move that furthers Thailand’s ambitions of becoming a regional crypto hub. This change came into effect on January 1, 2024. Following Binance Thailand’s launch in January , Thailand has seemingly been working in the background to increase its global presence as a crypto-friendly nation through favorable regulations. Also in January this year, Thailand’s SEC posted another update  to its crypto frameworks, with a notable one being a lift on retail investors’ limits on tokens backed by real-world assets (RWAs), which was previously set to 300,000 baht (or approximately $4500). These exemptions and other pro-crypto legislation appear to have arrived in a timely manner, potentially setting the stage for an interesting crypto industry breakout in Thailand this year."

Draper believes the country could become one of the wealthiest nations within the next three decades as a result of its Bitcoin adoption. Venture capitalists and financial experts are beginning to align with the early adopters of Bitcoin. Among them, investor Tim Draper,  has reflected on El Salvador’s move to embrace Bitcoin as legal tender. Speaking on the Web3 Deep Dive podcast  with host Rachel Wolfson, Draper expressed his belief that Bitcoin is contributing to El Salvador’s development and improvement. He also predicted that the cryptocurrency will play a crucial role in shaping the nation’s future in the years ahead. He said : “They will have within maybe 30 or 40 years gone from the poorest most crime-ridden country to maybe one of the richest most innovative countries in the world just in that period of time and just because they embraced Bitcoin.” Tim Draper argued that the Bitcoin investments made under President Nayib Bukele’s leadership could help El Salvador settle its debts with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and sever future financial dependency.

 During a recent interview , MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor said Bitcoin would significantly outperform gold soon. Saylor claimed BTC was a superior asset in all aspects. Saylor claimed  that Bitcoin’s advantages were greater than gold’s. He even suggested it could eclipse traditional investments, like real estate and stocks. The MicroStrategy boss argued that Bitcoin transcends its role as a digital version of gold. He said it possessed all of gold’s favorable qualities and none of its shortcomings. He argued that  Bitcoin’s digital transferability was a unique advantage. Saylor went so far as to liken it to the hypothetical ability to instantly teleport gold across continents.

He said it had an unparalleled speed of transactions—up to a million times faster than conventional assets. He stated : “Bitcoin is competing with gold. It’s going to eat it.” Saylor also said Bitcoin’s around-the-clock availability for transactions was another benefit. He said : “If you want to buy a house on Saturday in Africa … if you want to buy a car on Sunday morning, [Bitcoin] is the way to do it.” He illustrated this point by revealing that MicroStrategy capitalized on this advantage, conducting most of its recent $820 million Bitcoin acquisition on a Saturday. Saylor claimed the company would not have been able to do that with traditional assets. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted  the rapid growth of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which could overtake gold ETFs in the near future.

Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin reached yet another all-time high, even as US President Joe Biden unveiled a range of proposals about crypto. BTC is in a notable bullish phase, trading at a record $72,850.71 on March 12, buoyed by increased trading accessibility and a weaker dollar. Meanwhile, Biden announced plans to reintroduce a wash trading rule, a tax on crypto mining, and other regulatory measures in his proposed budget  for the upcoming year. The administration estimates these taxes could yield close to $10 billion in 2025 and exceed $42 billion over the next decade. Bitcoin soared to a record high  of $72,850 on March 12. The overall market capitalization of cryptocurrencies increased by 4.6% to approximately $2.72 trillion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $166 billion, marking a 41.3% rise. Stablecoins accounted for $149.9 billion, or 90.3%, of the total crypto market’s 24-hour volume, according to CoinMarketCap  data. Bitcoin’s recent surge past $72,500 highlights its dominance in the market, supported by bullish technical signals. It faces resistance at $73,824, $76,749, and $79,904, but finds support at $67,154, $64,861, and $62,192, safeguarding against declines. Although there is some evidence of overbuying, Bitcoin’s push beyond $70,000 suggests a continued upward movement. Indeed, the coin is aiming to reach over $73,800. The 50-day EMA, positioned at $66,860, further underscores the bullish outlook. The president’s budget proposal  for the next fiscal year, unveiled on Monday, outlines key initiatives targeting the cryptocurrency sector. These include the application of wash sale rules to digital assets, mandatory information reporting for financial institutions and crypto brokers, foreign account reporting for crypto, the inclusion of crypto in mark-to-market taxation, and the introduction of an excise tax on cryptocurrency mining operations.

They aim to eliminate tax loopholes that primarily target wealthy individuals and major corporations. These measures  include The budget proposal  seeks to address a loophole exploited in the cryptocurrency market, particularly with non-fungible tokens (NFTs), by extending traditional market wash trading rules to crypto assets. Currently, unlike stock or bond investors, crypto investors can sell a cryptocurrency at a loss to claim a significant tax deduction and then repurchase the same cryptocurrency the next day. The budget aims to close this gap by updating the tax code to ensure that anti-abuse rules applicable to stocks and other securities also apply to cryptocurrencies, as detailed in a fact sheet  released alongside the budget. The administration’s summary table reveals an ambitious revenue projection from tightening regulations on digital asset transactions. By incorporating digital asset transactions into wash sale rules, the administration anticipates generating over $1 billion in fiscal year 2025, with the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in mark-to-market rules expected to bring in upwards of $8 billion. 🇺🇸 President Joe Biden's 2025 budget proposal revives a 30% tax on electricity for crypto miners, aiming to address digital asset taxation gaps.  Set to phase in over 3 years, the tax targets both purchased and self-generated electricity costs in mining operations. — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) March 12, 2024   Over the next ten years, these measures could yield $25 billion from wash sale rules and $7.3 billion from mark-to-market rules. However, the latter should contribute to the national deficit after 2025. Additionally, an excise tax on cryptocurrency mining could, potentially, cut around $7 billion from the national deficit. The latest budget proposal  from the Biden administration marks a repeated effort to implement a mining excise tax and address the wash sales trading loophole, echoing initiatives from last year’s budget that Congress did not incorporate into the final budget bills. This proposal follows President Biden’s State of the Union address, where digital assets were not mentioned. Both President Biden and former President Donald Trump appeared to clinch their respective parties’ nominations for the upcoming 2024 general election in November. Indeed, in comparison to the seemingly-crypto sceptic Biden, Trump appears to be warming to Bitcoin. He recently claimed BTC was “an additional form of currency”."

Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin trading volumes have reached an all-time high as people and institutions continue to buy BTC, pushing it past $70,000. 24-hour spot BTC trading volumes are now above $1.3 billion on Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges. With a fresh influx of investor capital and avid trading activity, what could this all mean for the crypto market? As markets continue to rally, Coinbase’s 24-hour spot Bitcoin trading volumes have exceeded $1.3 billion, according to CoinPaprika . Following the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in January 2024, a brief market correction shed some price gains from the BTC market. It wasn’t long, however, until BTC started to rally and push for a new ATH. In the weeks leading up to its record BTC trading volumes, both the  Coinbase app and website were gaining noticeable traction ,. Interestingly, Bitcoin spot trading volumes were spiking upwards just as BTC bulls set their sights on breaking past its record once again. $BTC  haven't even broken all-time highs and the #Bitcoin  spot trading volumes going through the roof on Coinbase.

The significance of this heightened activity and interest would suggest that not only major investors, i.e. whales, are making big moves on Coinbase. Multiple posts from whale tracking bot, Whale Alert , have reported large sums of BTC moving through the exchange. 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 1,965 #BTC  (141,852,439 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to Coinbase Institutionalhttps://t.co/196L9kSOaY  — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) March 11, 2024   Heightened trading volumes caused by whales are typically followed by significant price movements. As they accumulate BTC, they increase market liquidity. As a result, this attracts more institutional players to enter the space, reinforcing upward momentum and drawing in fresh retail investors. Bitcoin is likely to continue dominating headlines and investor interest in the run-up to the Halving, set to take place in April 2024. Indeed, the same may be said for Coinbase. Market sentiment towards crypto and Coinbase is increasingly positive. Data from The Block  shows that, by the end of 2023, Coinbase had approximately seven million monthly transacting users. Also, by the end of February 2024, North American users had recorded over $113 billion, with March figures on track to top that number. One of the most popular centralized cryptocurrency exchanges in the Western market, Coinbase serves as a major fiat on-ramp. Therefore, its total daily trading activity is an important indicator when it comes to evaluating market sentiment."

Ex-President Called it “Scam”, Now an “Additional Form of Currency”",https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/donald-trump-bitcoin-president-additional-currency/,"U.S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump appears to now be rather fond of cryptocurrency as he has stated that he’s “having fun” with crypto, going as far as to describe it as “an additional form of currency.” In addition, the former U.S. President has stated that if he’s re-elected, he will not be bringing regulatory authority down on Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. This comes in stark contrast to his comments in 2021 when he described Bitcoin as “a disaster waiting to happen.” Speaking with CNBC’s “Squawk Box”, Presidential hopeful Donald Trump appears to have softened his stance on cryptocurrencies, and now appears to be in favor of what he calls “crazy new currencies.” ""If you think of it, it's an additional form of currency. We did a limited edition sneaker run of 1,000 sneakers. And you could go through crazy new currencies,"" says @realDonaldTrump  on #crypto . ""I like staying with the dollar.

I want one currency, I want the dollar I don’t want people leaving the dollar. I feel that way, but I will tell you it has taken on a life,” Though he says he doesn’t hold any himself, Trump noted that some of his limited-edition “Never Surrender” sneakers we purchased with crypto. “And I noticed so many of them were paid for with the new currency. It’s a new cryptocurrency. I couldn’t believe the amount.” While Trump didn’t specify the frequency or how he accepts Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, his words are yet another signal that crypto has gone completely mainstream in America.

Despite the numerous and ongoing legal battles between crypto firms and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), crypto is on the up in America. Trump’s words come at a time when major institutions and investors in the U.S. are now latching on to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the first time in America, and as the price of BTC skyrockets.

Key Takeaways
 MicroStrategy’s strategic accumulation of Bitcoin has positively impacted the crypto market confidence, profiting the company before the digital asset hit an all-time high. The company reportedly purchased 12,000 BTC between February 26, and March 10, 2024. It invested around $821.7 million in cash, according to a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The acquisition is possibly a key factor behind Bitcoin’s remarkable surge past the $72,000 mark. MicroStrategy, the largest public company in terms of Bitcoin holdings, recently announced the completion of a private offering of 0.625% convertible senior notes, due in 2030.Investors could turn their loans to the company into MicroStrategy’s stock at a later time. As per the filing , the company managed to sell these bonds for a total of $800 million. MicroStrategy largely allocated the proceeds from this offering, totaling approximately $782 million, to fund the acquisition of 12,000 BTC. MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 12,000 BTC for ~$821.7M using proceeds from convertible notes & excess cash for ~$68,477 per #bitcoin . As of 3/10/24, $MSTR  hodls 205,000 $BTC  acquired for ~$6.91B at average price of $33,706 per bitcoin. https://t.co/YayyKtpz8d  — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) March 11, 2024   The company’s decision to purchase BTC using the proceeds from the offering, coupled with an additional $40.6 million of excess cash, was executed at an average price of approximately $68,477 per Bitcoin. This strategic acquisition increased MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to about 205,000 BTC. It has spent about $6.91 billion to buy BTC over time, at an average cost of about $33,706 per Bitcoin. The crypto’s price experienced a significant uptick after the announcement, reflecting the impact of large-scale institutional investments. Bitcoin’s price, influenced by MicroStrategy’s acquisition, briefly surpassed the $72,000 level on March 11 before stabilizing under it. Additionally, the overall market sentiment was further buoyed by Michael Saylor’s advocacy for Bitcoin as a superior investment compared to traditional assets like gold, equity, or real estate. MicroStrategy’s founder said in an interview with CNBC that BTC is digital property. #Bitcoin  is Digital Property. It is superior to other investments such as Gold, Equity, or Real Estate because it is digital, available, global, ethical, & useful to millions of companies and billions of people. pic.twitter.com/738dblB0Zt  — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) March 11, 2024   Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s senior analyst Eric Balchunas also highlighted that within just the first two months of the year, the 10 ETFs have collectively surpassed $55 billion in assets, with trading volume reaching $110 billion. First two months officially in the books (it's felt like six) and the ten bitcoin ETFs now have over $55b in assets with exactly double that in volume at $110b. If these were the numbers at the end of year I'd call them a success. To do it in eight weeks is simply absurd. pic.twitter.com/8YvzQZdYyJ  — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) March 11, 2024   Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures told CCN: “In just over two months of going live, Blackrock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC have already accumulated more than $12b and $7.5b in AUM. Even though most experts were predicting such flows for the entire year of 2024, the speed of accumulation and subsequent price rise were unexpected.” While the price surge on the back of institutions is noteworthy, Chaturvedi noted that retail participation is still nowhere close to the mania seen in 2021. MicroStrategy’s aggressive accumulation notes a bullish stance on its future trajectory. Meanwhile, the broader trend of institutional interest in cryptocurrencies is positive. Bitcoin price is currently a response to substantial investments by institutions while retail investors could continue to underline growing acceptance, with more upside expected."

Key Takeaways
 JPMorgan argues that the idea of Bitcoin’s market cap reaching $3.3 trillion, matching gold’s presence in portfolios and potentially doubling its price, fails to consider the associated risks. According to  a JPMorgan strategist, expecting Bitcoin to equate to gold in investor portfolios in terms of notional value is not realistic. The strategist emphasized  investors typically factor in risk and volatility when diversifying investments across different asset classes. Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a global market strategist at JPMorgan, shared  insights into Bitcoin’s prospects within the investment landscape. To gauge the possible allocation towards Bitcoin by registered investment advisors (RIAs), Panigirtzoglou drew a comparison between Bitcoin and gold, highlighting Bitcoin’s reputation as the digital counterpart of gold. Within the extensive $235 trillion market encompassing traditional and alternative asset classes (excluding bank and foreign exchange reserves), Panigirtzoglou pointed out that investment-grade gold represents approximately $3.3 trillion. This figure translates to a gold allocation of about 1.4%. I think people assume that extremely high priced gold also means extremely high priced everything else. But a bubble isn't driven by fundamentals it's driven by emotion. Did $70,000 bitcoin equate to $100 bread? Yes I think inflation will be high but the last several years of… — Gary Savage (@garysavage1) March 3, 2024   Interestingly, he noted that only 7% of this gold, equating to $230 billion, is invested through funds. Primarily, he said, they were in  physical gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The majority of gold investments come in the form of bars and coins, according to Panigirtzoglou’s observations. He said : “One could argue that if Bitcoin matches gold in investors’ portfolios, its market cap should rise to $3.3 trillion from $1.3 trillion currently, implying more than doubling in price. However, this calculation misses an important factor which is risk.” Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a strategist at JPMorgan, emphasized the importance of considering risk and volatility when diversifying investments across various asset classes. He noted that Bitcoin’s volatility was approximately 3.7 times higher than that of gold, making it expecting Bitcoin to occupy a similar position as gold in investors’ portfolios in terms of notional values unrealistic. Panigirtzoglou elaborated further. He said equating Bitcoin with gold in terms of risk capital would significantly adjust the implied allocation. This, he said, would move to about $0.9 trillion from $3.3 trillion. This shows a more tempered perspective on Bitcoin’s potential market capitalization. He explained : “This implies a bitcoin price of $45,000, significantly lower from current levels. In other words, with the bitcoin price at $68,000 currently, the implied allocation to bitcoin within investors’ portfolios has already surpassed that of gold in volatility adjusted terms.” Panigirtzoglou has provided insights  into the future composition of Bitcoin investments, particularly in ETFs. Drawing parallels with gold, where approximately $230 billion is invested through ETFs, and applying the volatility ratio, Panigirtzoglou claims Bitcoin ETFs could realistically reach about $62 billion. He believes Bitcoin ETFs could reach this target in somewhere between two and three years. This suggests much of the inflow into Bitcoin ETFs might come from a shift from existing investment instruments and platforms. Dropped this in the weekly free newsletter.

The bank predicted a drop to $42,000 following the April halving event. According to Panigirtzoglou, current market prices reflect both the halving and the significant upcoming Ethereum upgrade. As a result, this suggests they will have a limited impact on future price movements."

Key Takeaways
 ARK Invest has revised its projections for Bitcoin, anticipating it will reach the $1 million mark before the year 2030. This adjustment in the forecast came as Bitcoin demonstrated robust price performance , nearing a series of all-time highs. According to the CEO of ARK Invest, Bitcoin’s milestone achievement is expected sooner than previously anticipated. During an interview  with the New Zealand Herald on March 7, ARK boss Cathie Wood shared insights on “revised projections for institutional participation” in the growth of Bitcoin’s price. Cathie Wood has acknowledged the impact of the United States launching its first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In her remarks, the prominent supporter of Bitcoin reaffirmed her strong belief in the cryptocurrency’s future prospects. Wood pointed out the remarkable enthusiasm and momentum generated by the spot ETFs, compelling ARK Invest to reassess its optimistic stance on Bitcoin. While the firm previously set a price target of $1 million for Bitcoin by 2030, the introduction of spot ETFs has prompted a revision of this forecast, indicating a more bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency’s trajectory. Wood explained  that the previous price target for Bitcoin was set before the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  granted its approval, a move she considers a significant milestone that has accelerated the cryptocurrency’s timeline. Despite the absence of major financial institutions like Morgan Stanley, Merryl Lynch, or Bank of America from the institutional adoption of Bitcoin, the market has already witnessed substantial price movements. Wood pointed out  that these developments have occurred even before any major platform has officially endorsed Bitcoin, suggesting that the real momentum is yet to kick in. Given these factors, she believes that the initial projection of Bitcoin reaching $1 million by 2030 now appears too modest. Good Morning Everyone! Bitcoin was less than $300 away from hitting RECORD high in the last 24 hours. Remember, Cathie Wood said her base case is $600,00 by 2030 and her bull case is $1.5 million.

Milestones such as the public listing  of the cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase, setting new price records, and receiving endorsements from regulators and policymakers underscore the growing recognition and potential of cryptocurrency in the financial landscape. The most straightforward method for making purchases with Bitcoin is through the use of a crypto debit card. These cards can be preloaded with the cryptocurrency of your choice, allowing for easy spending. When you use crypto to make a purchase, the retailer receives fiat currency as payment. Crypto debit cards collaborate with major payment processors such as Mastercard and Visa, guaranteeing smooth and hassle-free transactions. There are a wide range of items you can buy with one BTC. Let’s take a look at some of them. The automotive sector has embraced Bitcoin, with luxury brands like Lamborghini and the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla enabling car purchases via cryptocurrency. Although you may not be able to buy a Lambo, you can afford premium SUVs like the Toyota Fortuner, Jeep Compass, MG Gloster and Ford Endeavour.

This landmark decision acknowledged the growing demand for more flexible and modern payment solutions. Metromile, an insurance company offering “pay-per-mile” auto insurance policies, has also integrated Bitcoin into its payment options.

 On Friday, March 8, 2024, Bitcoin reached a new peak, surging to the milestone of $70,000 for the first time in its history. The king of cryptocurrencies had already set a new record just three days before. It surpassed its previous high and broke the $70,000 barrier on March 8. What lies ahead for BTC?

As shown in the graph below, BTC reached this level and then retraced slightly. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC reached $70,083.05 around 1530 GMT. Bitcoin then dropped slightly, and on CoinMarketCap, it is currently valued at $68,414.32 at the time of writing. On Tuesday, March 5, 2024, Bitcoin surged to another milestone, reaching an all-time high.

Beginning the year 2024 on a positive trajectory, Bitcoin was bolstered by a series of significant developments that buoyed trader sentiment and confidence. Since its dip below $20,000 in 2022, Bitcoin has defied expectations with a staggering surge of over 300%. This remarkable ascent, which began in November 2022, has surpassed previous records, including the one set in November 2021 when Bitcoin came tantalizingly close to hitting $68,790. The resurgence of interest from both seasoned investors and newcomers alike, coupled with a thriving crypto market environment, has fueled Bitcoin’s remarkable journey to its latest peak According to our technical analysis, Bitcoin is teetering on the edge of its record highs, yet the Relative Strength Index at 88% signals it as overbought, warranting caution. History suggests that sharp increases in value often precede corrections, and if this pattern holds true, Bitcoin could be poised for a significant downturn, potentially retracting by 40% or more. The outcome of this surge remains uncertain, as March could either propel Bitcoin to new peaks or usher in a notable pullback. Despite the prospect of scaling new all-time highs, the probability of Bitcoin maintaining its upward trajectory appears slender. It momentarily breached the $70,000 mark without immediate signs of weakness."

El Salvador’s bonds have witnessed a remarkable increase over the past year, with debt securities maturing in 2052 now trading above 80 cents on the dollar, as reported by FactSet data. Aged 42, Nayib Bukele boasts one of the highest approval ratings worldwide, largely because of his aggressive crackdown on gangs. This approach has significantly reduced homicide rates, following the detainment of more than 76,000 individuals. Last month, an independent exit poll by CID Gallup  indicated even greater approval for Nayib Bukele, with an estimated 87% of Salvadorans supporting the incumbent.

This potential re-election comes after a contentious decision by judges associated with his party to repeal a ban on consecutive terms, raising alarms about the state of democracy in the country."

Key Takeaways
 Billionaire investor Mark Cuban anticipates  an increase in Bitcoin’s price. The co-owner of the Dallas Mavericks NBA franchise attributes this to a supply-demand dynamic. He reasons the demand will surpass the number of sellers, and also he views Bitcoin (BTC) as an excellent store of value. During a CNBC appearance on Monday, the billionaire investor and “Shark Tank” star opened up  about his cryptocurrency investments. Cuban, was asked about the extent of his portfolio dedicated to cryptocurrency. He replied that, while he wasn’t sure of the exact amount, he was content with his holdings, especially in Bitcoin and, to a lesser extent, Ethereum. 🦈💰🔗 ""Shark Tank"" billionaire investor Mark Cuban has made his stance clear on Bitcoin, favoring it over gold ""all day, every day."" As Bitcoin soared past $68,000, nearing its all-time high, more funds poured into the leading cryptocurrency by market value. 💼📈💡 In an… — Rose Crypto News (@Rose52187038266) March 5, 2024   He attributed his investment rationale to the supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin. Cuban said the cryptocurrency’s limited supply of 21 million coins was a key factor driving his interest. He explained : “The more people that buy and the fewer people that sell, that means the price is going to go up. That’s just the nature of it. It’s a great store of value. That’s why I have an investment in it, because I do feel that the demand is going to exceed the number of people selling.” Discussing the possibility of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Mark Cuban shared his perspective, noting the unique characteristics of Ethereum. He highlighted Ethereum’s utility-driven nature and the increasing number of applications leveraging its utility, suggesting these factors could influence the SEC’s decision on an Ethereum ETF approval. The financial community is eagerly awaiting the SEC’s decision on a spot Ethereum ETF, expected in May. The biggest Altcoinseason in history is about to come. And here is why: The Spot #Ethereum  ETF will get accepted in 76 days. Institutional liquidity will flow into $ETH . And this will cause the biggest Altcoin season ever seen in history. pic.twitter.com/dM9eiByLtt  — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) March 7, 2024   Analysts are split on the outcome. On one hand Standard Chartered Bank is optimistic about an approval, whereas JPMorgan adopts a more cautious stance. This reflects the varying perspectives on the potential impact and acceptance of this cryptocurrency investment product. Mark Cuban expressed  that the most significant letdown in the cryptocurrency world has been the absence of a standout application capable of capturing widespread mainstream attention, akin to Instagram’s impact during the app revolution. He emphasized the need for a “transitional application” that would make cryptocurrency universally adopted, underlining the gap between current crypto applications and the potential for broader, mainstream appeal. Cuban said : “But, until then, just from an investment perspective, I’m investing in Bitcoin over gold all day every day, and I have said that for years.”"

Key Takeaways
 The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has deferred its decision  on approving options trading for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This decision holds the potential to usher more institutional capital into the Bitcoin market. The SEC has postponed its decision to allow Cboe Exchange  and the Miami International Securities Exchange  to offer options on Bitcoin ETFs, as per a March 6 filing. Additionally, it has delayed  its decision regarding Nasdaq’s proposal to offer options on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The regulator says the extension will provide “sufficient time to consider” the requests. All exchanges had initially filed for listing Bitcoin ETF options on January 25. The was then SEC facing its first decision deadline on March 10. This is because of US securities laws which grant a 45-day period to make or defer a decision. The deferral grants the SEC an additional 45 days, reaching the maximum allowed 90 days under the law, to make a final decision. The SEC has marked April 24 as its new deadline. Options trading allows traders to leverage their positions and place bets on market directions with less capital. For example, by purchasing a “call option,” a trader can agree to buy one BTC at today’s price in a month. The trader can then profit, if Bitcoin’s value rises—risking only the premium paid if the market declines. Advocates like Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein have urged for the approval of options trading for Bitcoin ETFs, arguing they enhance market robustness. SEC defers decision on spot bitcoin ETF options trading https://t.co/xajPYzY1SF  via @business  — Yahoo Finance (@YahooFinance) March 7, 2024   Analyst Dave Nadig of VettaFi suggested  that the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options could attract hedge funds and other investors who have previously avoided direct cryptocurrency speculation. As a result, he suggested, there could be new opportunities for market engagement. On January 11, the SEC approved ten spot Bitcoin ETFs for trading, marking the end of a prolonged period of deliberation. These ETFs, excluding Grayscale’s conversion to an ETF, have collectively amassed $25.87 billion in assets under management as of March 6, according to BitMEX Research .

Key Takeaways
 The crypto community is once again buzzing about Tesla’s Bitcoin holdings  following the addition of a wallet tracking feature to Arkham Intelligence’s dashboard. Speculation abounds, with some users suggesting that Tesla may be acquiring Bitcoin, potentially unveiling details during its upcoming earnings call , while others ponder the possibility of an accounting discrepancy. As of the latest update, Tesla’s Bitcoin holdings have increased  to approximately 11,509 BTC. This marks a significant uptick of 1,789 BTC from the 9,720 BTC disclosed in its previous earnings announcement. Elon Musk’s company made a substantial investment in Bitcoin, purchasing $1.5 billion  of the cryptocurrency in February 2021 during the height of the previous market surge. Additionally, the company has revealed intentions to accept Bitcoin as payment for its vehicles. Be it as it may, Tesla’s foray into Bitcoin adoption experienced a brief tenure . It initially sold roughly 10% of its Bitcoin holdings in March 2021. By the second quarter of 2022, the electric vehicle giant had divested approximately 75% of its Bitcoin investments. Here’s a concise timeline detailing Tesla’s interactions with Bitcoin. Elon Musk’s relationship with Bitcoin has been a rollercoaster. In 2021, he showcased a bullish outlook on BTC, revealing Tesla’s strategy to hold Bitcoin in on-chain wallets. Yet, mere weeks after this announcement, Musk reversed his decision to accept Bitcoin as payment for Tesla vehicles, attributing the change to environmental worries surrounding the energy-intensive process of Bitcoin mining. On Twitter, there’s speculation among users regarding the recent increase in Tesla’s Bitcoin holdings. One user pondered  whether Tesla has recommenced buying Bitcoin, or if the alteration in numbers could be attributed to an accounting mistake.

Elon Musk’s venture, SpaceX, has added Bitcoin to its balance sheet, following a suggestion from MicroStrategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor . This move places SpaceX alongside Tesla in Musk’s portfolio of companies that hold Bitcoin. MicroStrategy itself is a major player in the Bitcoin space, with 193,000 BTC in its holdings, making it the world’s largest institutional investor in Bitcoin. Whatever sins this platform may have, being boring is not one of them — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 17, 2023   At the Bitcoin Atlantis conference  on March 1, during a panel discussion, Saylor advocated for a bright future for Bitcoin.

Key Takeaways
 Pantera Capital Portfolio Manager and Crypto Asset Manager Cosmo Jiang thinks there is a potential crypto market shift, favoring altcoins over Bitcoin. Jiang highlighted the potential of the broader cryptocurrency market, while the industry is focused on Bitcoin’s price rally. Despite BTC being the largest crypto by market cap, let’s understand where altcoins can outpace Bitcoin in market performance. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Cosmo Jiang brought attention to the vast universe of digital assets.  He said: “It’s important to realize that digital assets are a lot more than just [Bitcoin]. There are 400 tokens with more than a $100 million market cap.” Pantera Capital portfolio manager @cosmo_jiang  joins Yahoo Finance to discuss how investors can account for the recent bitcoin rally: pic.twitter.com/StHqARzFk8  — Yahoo Finance (@YahooFinance) March 6, 2024   Notably, diversity indicates a maturing market where investors are looking beyond Bitcoin to find value and potential in other cryptocurrencies. Pantera Capital manager explained: “As the next cycle gets underway, we believe that – and we’ve seen over the last few cycles – that the other coins, outside of Bitcoin, really can outperform by many multiples during the different phases of the bull market.” Jiang also emphasized a long-term commitment to the cryptocurrency market. He believes that tokens represent a new approach to capital formation, diverging from traditional pathways, such as listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Bitcoin’s dominance—a metric that compares its market cap with the total cryptocurrency market cap—serves as a key indicator of broader market strength against BTC. Currently, Bitcoin accounts for more than half of the market. Ideally, a declining dominance with Bitcoin’s price rise could signal a shift towards altcoins. Crypto analyst Jelle noted on Twitter that the altcoin market cap has broken out from a prolonged accumulation phase. Recent trends could also show a shift in market sentiment towards altcoins. The Fear & Greed index has hit  90, suggesting a peak in investor interest. Trading volumes illustrate that investors could be looking for alternative avenues, with altcoins such as Ethereum, Tether, and other rivals logging in positive activity. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe hints at a significant cycle for cryptocurrencies, with altcoins expected to outperform in the upcoming months. He tweeted: “The pre-halving high for Bitcoin is likely in.” Big macro-economic events on the horizon, I'm expecting that we're likely going to take the liquidity above the highs and fall back for #Bitcoin . In the meantime: Altcoins firing up! pic.twitter.com/6yN6VwumSR  — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) March 7, 2024   Meanwhile, there is a broader interest in meme coins and other significant altcoin categories. The interest is also reflected in the trading volumes as  Ethereum, BNB, Solana, and Cardano are showing strong performance metrics. This has been especially the case since the focus has shifted to the decision on ETH ETF, making way for subsequent approvals. Tether also managed to touch $100 billion in volume recently. The collective market cap of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tokens has moved beyond $25 billion, according to CoinGecko data. Bitcoin’s price reaching an all-time high has made altcoins take center stage. Despite BTC’s strong dominance, altcoin trading volumes suggest the sector is gaining traction. While some analysts expect the next few months to potentially usher in an altcoin season, diversification across token categories might be the key."

Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin surpassed an all-time high price level of $69K on March 4 before tumbling lower. The non-fungible token (NFT) trading volume for Bitcoin Ordinals also showed a resurgence around the time. With sales in major Ordinals marketplaces surpassing billions, is the trend coinciding with Bitcoin’s next halving? Data from a Dune  dashboard indicates a significant jump in Ordinals trading volume. So far, the marketplace volumes have surpassed $2.5b with more than 2m transactions. The sector remained relatively quiet until the recent price rally in Bitcoin. According to CryptoSlam , sales volume for these unique digital assets involves over 371,900 buyers and 322,000 sellers at press time. The total sales transactions for March till now have crossed $161.25m. The figure was under $870m in December 2023 but lower in the adjacent months. Recently, Bitcoin Ordinals-based NFTs known as NodeMonkes became the third most valuable NFT in terms of market capitalization. At press time, it has dropped to the fourth spot With Ethereum-based BAYC and MAYC NFTs taking over the place on CoinGecko charts . Bitcoin Puppets is next on the charts on spot 10. The spike in Ordinals trading came with Bitcoin’s price recovery, supported by BTC ETF inflows and the pre-halving rally. This price momentum has not only rejuvenated interest in Bitcoin NFTs but also impacted the broader NFT market, as seen with a CryptoPunk selling for 4,500 ether, approximately $16 million. Punk 3100 bought for 4,500 ETH ($16,032,959.47 USD) by 0x705876 from 0x7b8961. https://t.co/YMzLi5i8se  #cryptopunks  #ethereum  pic.twitter.com/FcdGF83uNc  — CryptoPunks Bot (@cryptopunksbot) March 4, 2024     Ordinals embed unique identifiers and additional data onto individual satoshis, facilitating the creation and trade of NFT-like assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. The resurgence of Bitcoin NFTs could present a challenge to Ethereum’s dominance in the future. Over 30 days, Ethereum accounted for 52.2% of NFT sales volume, with Bitcoin closely following at 47.8% as per the Dune dashboard. Despite the positive price action, the cost to transact on the Bitcoin network has not seen much change. Data from BitInfoCharts  highlights that the average transaction fee on the Bitcoin network is currently close to $15 on March 6, higher than the February average but lower than the $37 peak recorded in December 2023. At the same time, CoinGecko’s price floor charts show an increase in the market capitalization of Bitcoin NFTs, accompanied by a surge in volume and overall market cap across all blockchain networks at press time. The resurgence in trading volume for NFTs and the positive Bitcoin price can signal market improvement. With the Bitcoin halving event approaching in April and rising BTC prices, accompanied by increased interest in NFTs, can pull up Ordinals transcriptions in 2024. However, the sentiments around the broader NFT market will play a role. "

Key Takeaways
 New revelations about the elusive Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, have emerged from an email analysis. It shed light on his operational patterns and potential whereabouts during Bitcoin’s early development. The analysis comes due to the legal dispute around the true identity of Bitcoin’s founder. On March 1, Wright answered a line of questions against evidence tempering raised by COPA. The email  exchange between Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti Malmi, a key developer in the early Bitcoin project, revolve around feature development, user interface, and strategies to increase daily user engagement, revealing the project’s nascent stage and search for a solid use case. The analysis of 260 messages submitted in the COPA vs. CSW court case indicates that Satoshi likely began Bitcoin development in January 2008 and was probably based in the US, masquerading as operating from the UK. Analysis of the timestamps from the 145 emails sent from Satoshi Nakamoto to @marttimalmi  shows that they line up perfectly with the existing temporal activity pattern from Satoshi's public posts and code commits. pic.twitter.com/1VxkA9yRiu  — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) February 25, 2024     The use of Anglicisms alongside American slang, and system time settings, were part of a strategy to obscure his true location. Satoshi’s departure in 2011 is in the background of the recent legal disputes between Craig Wright and Bitcoin community members who disagree with the claim that Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto The legal disputes have seen Craig Wright defend his claim to being Satoshi Nakamoto amid defamation lawsuits against the community who disgreed. The 2024 COPA vs. CSW court case intellectual property litigation alleges fabricated evidence by Wright to support his claim. Wright’s legal team, led by his counsel, is contending with allegations that the documents they submitted, which include a series of emails between Wright and his former solicitors from Ontier LLP, were potentially doctored. Jonathan Hough, representing COPA, has highlighted discrepancies in the timestamps and content of these emails, suggesting another attempt at deception by Wright. The court case started after Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) members rejected a settlement offer from Wright as a ‘hard pass.’ Wright’s cross-examination and the scrutiny over alleged backdated financial documents have got digital forensics experts involved. Wright’s credibility suffered a blow when the UK Supreme Court denied his final appeal in a defamation case against cryptocurrency podcast host Peter McCormack. Meanwhile, the COPA case outcome could have significant implications for Bitcoin, particularly regarding copyright claims on the asset. Recent court sessions have involved intense examination of evidence, with Patrick Madden, COPA’s expert witness, presenting a new report on the contentious emails. COPA vs CSW Trial We created the below diagram, which we believe help explains what Craig is claiming with respect to the @OntierLLP  email mess.

The email analysis has narrowed down the operational details of Bitcoin’s mysterious founder, suggesting Satoshi Nakamoto was the sole actor based in the US.  The outcome of the COPA legal battle, which is scheduled to close in mid-March 2024, will have far-reaching consequences for the Bitcoin community. It will possibly give more insights about its creator if not revealing the identity altogether."

Key Takeaways
 The Bitcoin price started to emerge from a prolonged “crypto winter” in the fourth quarter of 2023. Now, experts anticipate it could soar to $100,000 by the end of 2024. Standard Chartered previously predicted that the surge to six figures would be down to a combination of factors. Although Bitcoin reached a new all-time high on March 5, it went on the downturn. Can the top crypto jump to new heights in the year of the halving? In 2023, Standard Chartered announced  an optimistic forecast for Bitcoin, stating it could reach $100,000 in 2024. The prediction was based on banking sector turmoil and an expected stabilization of risk assets from monetary policies. Bitcoin’s recovery from its 2023 lows and its current stabilization above $65,000 makes the market optimistic about it reaching $100,000. Meanwhile, developments such as Bitcoin ETF approvals by the United States Securities & Exchange Commission have been instrumental in drawing more investment into Bitcoin. Bitcoin ETF gross inflows hit all-time high high thanks to record surge in Fidelity's FBTC. GBTC outflows ease for 3rd day pic.twitter.com/X7HQpU5FeG  — zerohedge (@zerohedge) March 5, 2024   According to Lyn Alden of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy, around $8 billion in net inflows moved into Bitcoin ETFs. Since their inception, the inflows contributed to the rise in Bitcoin’s market capitalization by $300 billion. Therefore, even if the BTC ETF approval is already priced in by the market, the record inflows are giving Bitcoin a constant push. The limited supply of Bitcoin, capped at 21 million coins, coupled with its halving event — a mechanism that reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are created — is set to further squeeze the supply. Financial analysts, including Rajat Soni, CFA, underlined  the importance of these factors. About $8 billion in cumulative net ETF inflows (along with some other opaque exchange inflows) contributed to bitcoin rising in market cap by well over $300 billion. This is because during bear markets, coins rotate into long-term hands with a low propensity to sell. pic.twitter.com/M7tjikBfFP  — Lyn Alden (@LynAldenContact) March 5, 2024     Alden points out the bear market has led to Bitcoin holders being less likely to sell, setting the stage for a significant price rally with even a slight increase in demand. Soni further elaborates on Bitcoin’s appeal as a store of value, emphasizing how the decreasing supply against a backdrop of increasing demand should push its price upwards. Soni’s analysis extends beyond just the supply-demand dynamics. He foresees a pattern where the price of Bitcoin will climb in the next 12 to 18 months, due to April’s halving. However, he cautions against a potential price drop in 2026, predicting market volatility and the emergence of scams as retail investors chase gains, mirroring past cycles. The consensus among financial experts is that Bitcoin is on the brink of a fresh price milestone after its March rally. The next price rise should be propelled by a combination of regulatory approvals, supply constraints, and its growing appeal. While the path to $100,000 might be fraught with volatility, the overarching trend is positive. Bitcoin seems to be gradually absorbing economic value from traditional systems, making the $100,000 price target the next possibility."

Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen record inflows, pointing towards a brighter future for Bitcoin’s price. The BTC price reached an all-time high before tumbling down due to profit-taking. But, with 10 Bitcoin ETFs collectively reaching a $10 billion trading volume, surpassing previous benchmarks is a positive. The 10 Bitcoin ETFs, including notable names such as $IBIT, $FBTC, $BITB, and $ARKB, achieved a collective trading volume of $10 billion on March 5. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas called it a significant milestone during their relatively short existence of under two months. Bitcoin ETF volumes today pic.twitter.com/j0SXwVcIvN  — zerohedge (@zerohedge) March 5, 2024   Despite the relative price weakness in BTC, the inflows are indicative of a continued interest in crypto through traditional financial vehicles. March 5 marked net inflows worth $648m, the highest since the ETFs’ January inception. BlackRock emerged as the frontrunner, recording an $788.3m inflow. Fidelity garnered $125.6m while Ark Invest received $63.7 million. The influx of capital suggests demand for Bitcoin exposure, with Grayscale and Invesco being the only two issuers witnessing outflows. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF recorded net outflows of $332.5 million and $14.2 million, respectively. Despite some ETFs experiencing outflows, the overwhelming trend leans towards accumulation, signifying a bullish outlook among investors. The market will remain positive as news of major financial institutions like Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Bank of America making way to offer Bitcoin ETF access to their clients. Such developments underscore the growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate investment class. However, critics like economist Peter Schiff highlighted the volatility in Bitcoin ETF values, comparing  it against gold’s consistent performance in percentage terms. However, the broader market indicators, including decreased exchange reserves and a surge in Coinbase’s premium, suggest a strong institutional interest. Therefore, there is a potential for further price appreciation despite an almost 10% immediate fall from the peak. Parth Chaturvedi, the lead of investments at CoinSwitch Ventures, told CCN that the large involvement of institutions through spot BTC ETFs, along with investors’ expectations surrounding the upcoming BTC halving, are the primary factors propelling Bitcoin price. Chaturvedi said, “BTC has grown over 50% over the past month and over 150% in the last six months. With market capitalization of over $1.3T, BTC is larger than nearly all publicly traded companies while also closing in on silver as a commodity. With the halving still underway, we may get to see BTC prices go even higher and hit new ATHs [all-time highs] before retracing and continuing its rise.” The recent record-breaking inflows into Bitcoin ETFs reflect growing investor confidence and institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies. While BTC’s volatility persist for now, the influx of capital, coupled with increasing access to Bitcoin through traditional financial platforms, suggests a bullish future for the Bitcoin price."

Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $69,170.63 on March 5 2024. But where it can get to next and, perhaps more importantly, which next major crypto will hit a record price? Several factors had an impact on Bitcoin’s value in the current surge. Perhaps most notably, the significant demand for new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) helped boost the coin. As Bitcoin’s price soared to its highest level ever, analysts are now forecasting that its price could climb to $150,000  within the year and potentially reach $500,000 within the next five years. The CEO of Bitwise, known for its spot Bitcoin ETF offerings, has predicted  a Bitcoin price of $250,000. Bitcoin is going to eat into gold's TAM faster than people expect.  $250k Bitcoin could happen much sooner than most who've followed the space for years would imagine. Why? For 15 years, Bitcoin proved it's merits but was only accessible to some.  Bitcoin ETFs were Bitcoin's… — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) February 28, 2024   Similarly, Mike Novogratz from Galaxy Digital has expressed  that predicting the peak of this trend is challenging. He suggested that the upward trajectory could continue beyond current expectations. $BTC  is in price discovery phase. Maybe really for the first time since it’s been an asset as now the bulk of US wealth has easy access. Hard to predict where we stop. — Mike Novogratz (@novogratz) February 28, 2024   Fresh demand from institutional products, such as spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have attracted over $6.5 billion in net inflows since their inception, is fueling Bitcoin’s price. This demand spike comes as the supply of newly-issued Bitcoin is expected to decrease significantly. This is because, in April, the next Bitcoin reward halving event should take place. This supply-demand dynamic is leading to predictions of new all-time high prices for Bitcoin by the end of the year. According to CoinMarketCap , Bitcoin has experienced an impressive nearly 60% increase in value over the past month. Not only that, but its value has surged by more than 200% over the past year. Some analyses suggest that if Bitcoin were to replace gold in global portfolios and reach gold’s $13.72 trillion market  cap, the value of each Bitcoin could potentially escalate to as much as $700,000. Following its record-breaking peak, the price of Bitcoin has slightly retreated, currently standing at approximately $64,000. The upcoming Bitcoin halving is slated for the spring of 2024, with mid-April the most likely time for this significant event. Occurring every four years, Bitcoin halvings have historically been critical milestones for the cryptocurrency markets, often signaling the start of bull runs. This leads to the question: Which other cryptocurrencies might reach their all-time highs in the wake of the next halving? Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, a position it should maintain for the foreseeable future. With a market cap of $272 billion , Ethereum far outpaces its nearest rival, Tether, which has a market cap of around $95 billion. If there is a cryptocurrency bull market following the upcoming Bitcoin halving, Ethereum is poised for significant success. It has become the platform of choice for a wide array of blockchain-based projects, spanning decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), prediction markets, and beyond. Recent upgrades to the Ethereum protocol have enhanced ETH’s appeal as a long-term investment. A critical development, Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, introduced a mechanism for burning the base transaction fee for all Ethereum transactions. This, effectively, reduced the overall supply of ETH. Furthermore, Ethereum’s shift to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism in September 2022 sparked a significant reduction in ETH issuance. This figure has dropped to around 1,600 new ETH per day from around 13,000 ETH per day under the former Proof-of-Work system.

The project’s native token, ARB, commands a market capitalization of $2.28 billion, ranking it as the 37th largest crypto. In the event of a bull market, ARB could climb even higher in the market cap rankings. Solana is as one of the quickest smart contract platforms around. It’s important to note, however, that Solana has faced its share of challenges over the past year or so. These include technical glitches that led to temporary network halts and the fallout from the collapse of FTX, one of its major supporters, in a scandal that rocked the crypto world. Despite these setbacks, Solana remains robust and active. Its exceptional scalability supports a range of applications that are impractical on many other blockchain platforms. Solana hosts several projects such as Stepn, Helium, Magic Eden, and Orca, showcasing its decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem. Another compelling reason to consider Solana (SOL) currently is its market position, trading at over 64% below its all-time high. For those who see Solana’s enduring potential, now may be an opportune time to invest in SOL, especially with the upcoming Bitcoin halving on the horizon."

Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin’s price soared from the lows of 2023 to a record $69,000 at the start of March 2024. The rebound led to tokenized US Treasuries facing stagnation. A Crypto analyst has explained why the appeal of Bitcoin‘s potential returns has overshadowed the steady, but lower, yield from tokenized treasuries. While the tokenized financial instruments market remains a hot investment domain, US T-bills have also pulled back at press time. Tokenized US Treasuries had been on a steady growth trajectory until Bitcoin’s price recovery pulled it to a new all-time high. According to on-chain analyst Tom Wan, “the size of Tokenized US Treasuries have been growing steadily until Jan 2024 when Bitcoin was at $40k.” Wan explained in tweet that the Bitcoin rebound from $38,000 presented more lucrative opportunities than a steady 5% return. 🇺🇸Record $64bn 5y UST auction shows that investors are extending duration (vs 2y USTs) but want a higher yield to hold the notes: – Tail: 0.8bp– Indirect and direct bidders as well as BTC rebounded compared to last month ⚠️in Q2, the Treasury is looking to issue $70bn 5y notes pic.twitter.com/3BgDntVo8p  — Althea Spinozzi (@Altheaspinozzi) February 26, 2024   According to the analyst, the rise has resulted in stagnation, or even decline, in the total value locked (TVL) in popular tokenized treasury vehicles. The list includes OUSG, sDAI, USDM, and USDY. While the allure of higher Bitcoin returns has diverted attention and capital away from these stable yield offerings, tokenized projects are still growing. Wan suggested that for tokenized US Treasury projects to thrive, their focus should shift towards broader adoption and deeper integration within the financial ecosystem. The tokens should not focus on expanding their product lines into equities and bonds. This is because those types of assets carry uncertain regulatory risks and low investor interest. Instead, he highlighted the success of integrating with new Layer 2 solutions (L2s) and the potential for DeFi Treasury applications as avenues for growth.

But, overall, tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) presents a $16 trillion opportunity by 2030 in a conservative scenario, according to a Boston Consulting Group report. The US Treasury market, valued at almost $26.5 trillion, is the largest and most liquid in the world, playing a crucial role in global finance. Yields on Treasuries set the benchmark for risk-free rates globally. Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC, emphasized the importance of the US Treasury market in maintaining the dollar’s global leadership while talking to  The Financial Times. He likened its role to historical precedents set by the British and Dutch during their currency dominance. Gensler said: “Having that reliable, safe and readily accessible and tradeable asset is critical. It was critical to the British in their time as the leaders in currency.”  According to SIFMA, the issuance, trading and outstanding YTD treasury statistics are positive. However, on March 5, the US treasury yields were weak ahead of the February payroll data.   The Bitcoin price surge has challenged the growth of tokenized US Treasuries by drawing investors towards the cryptocurrency’s higher potential returns. On the other hand, the economics of higher return comes with higher risks. Nevertheless, the underlying value and stability offered by US Treasuries remain undisputed. However, its expansion as tokenized assets could take a while as the broader market could grow by 2030. Analysts suggest focusing on adoption, and integration over expansion for tokenized treasuries to flourish."

Key Takeaways
 A Bitcoin whale pattern has emerged for the current cycle that replicates activity from the past bull runs. Analysts note a twist in this cycle as Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are now leading the charge. Whale accumulation, coupled with significant ETF trading volumes and retail investor activity, raises a question. Are we on the cusp of a Bitcoin bull run, or is there just going to be consolidation? Bitcoin whales, large BTC holders, have historically played an important role in bull cycles. However, currently, it’s the Bitcoin ETFs that are akin to Bitcoin whales, drawing attention to price. Analysis by Ecoinometrics notes that BTC has experienced a price surge on the back of whale purchases. On March 4, Bitcoin ETF volumes hit $5.5 billion in trading volume on a single day. It was the second-highest trading volume since the ETFs’ January debut, coinciding with Bitcoin hitting a peak. In one week, US inflows have surpassed $1.8 billion with a majority contribution from Bitcoin ETFs, according to CoinShares data. Check out the striking correlation between the number of entities owning over 1,000 #BTC  and the rising price of #Bitcoin ! What's even more fascinating? These whales aren't selling; they're on an accumulation spree, hoarding more $BTC . pic.twitter.com/DIIjbNh3U2  — Ali (@ali_charts) March 4, 2024   Retail investors are also a major force in the Bitcoin Whale accumulation phase. Ecoinometrics  explains that all major ETF funds are siphoning coins from smaller investors and concentrating them among larger players or whales. The shift suggests a growing whale force behind Bitcoin, with ETFs like BlackRock and Grayscale leading the pack in terms of investment volumes. WhaleWire suggests major retail investors dived into the purchase cycle between $60,000 and $62,000. Many of them entered the market at peak prices, embodying the “Sell Low, Buy High” approach that often leads to losses due to ‘fear of missing out.’ On-chain data shows that millions of retail investors have purchased (Fomo'ed) into #Bitcoin  (671,000+ BTC bought) above $60,334 to $62,155 range.  Retail flooding in at the peak, what could possibly go wrong. ""Sell Low, Buy High"" – Retail Motto. pic.twitter.com/rULe2YHVKn  — WhaleWire (@WhaleWire) March 1, 2024   But the current price rally is ensuring all holders are at a profit. Meanwhile, crypto commentator Zerohedge  identifies one whale who has been on an accumulation spree over the past 15 months. The whale has repeatedly accumulated over $3 billion in Bitcoin. IntoTheBlock analysis of Bitcoin ownership by duration reveals three main types of investors: Hodlers, Cruisers, and Traders. Hodlers, who have held Bitcoin for over a year, are at the highest levels. This distinction is important as Hodlers hike their holdings at the start of a bull run and the reverse becomes true at the end of it.  The current Bitcoin price and accumulation is largely influenced by the Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin whales appears to be showing their confidence in Bitcoin’s future, with retail investors entering the market during this peak period. The accumulation patterns should lead to a sustained bull market despite small periods of profit-taking."

Key Takeaways
 Gold advocate Peter Schiff targeted  entrepreneur Mark Cuban on Monday for his preference for Bitcoin over gold. On a day when gold reached record highs, Schiff pointed out the scant media coverage gold received compared to other assets. Gold prices, as indicated by the SPDR Gold Trust GLD, surged past $2,110 per troy ounce on Monday. Schiff highlighted this achievement, contrasting it with ‘Shark Tank’ host Mark Cuban’s disinterest in gold. Cuban has openly expressed his preference for Bitcoin, stating: “I choose Bitcoin over gold every day.” Despite gold’s $33 increase, reaching its highest value  ever during US trading hours, Bitcoin overshadowed it.. Schiff noted that the precious metal was barely mentioned on CNBC, except when Cuban disclosed his lack of investment in gold. Schiff criticized  Cuban’s investment choice, remarking, “This shark is swimming in the wrong tank,” in a post on X. Despite gold's $33 rise today, hitting its highest price ever during U.S. trading hours, the only time I heard #gold  mentioned on #CNBC  was when @mcuban  said he wasn't buying any. He boasted that he ""chooses #Bitcoin  over gold every day."" This shark is swimming in the wrong tank. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) March 4, 2024   In a notable discussion  with Bill Maher during a podcast episode in January 2023, Mark Cuban fervently defended Bitcoin against skepticism, notably stating, “If you have gold, you’re dumb as f***.” He also mentioned his hope for a dip in Bitcoin prices to increase his holdings, contrasting Maher’s strong preference for gold investments. Cuban said owning physical gold was impractical, suggesting that in dire scenarios, possessing gold could lead to violent outcomes over its possession. Concurrently, Peter Schiff aired concerns about the burgeoning influence of Bitcoin ETFs on the market. He suggested their impact might be over-amplified and could also be potentially detrimental. He warned of a future where returns from Bitcoin ETFs could significantly underperform initial investments. The #BitcoinETFs  are the tail that wags the #Bitcoin  dog. A Bitcoin rally that lives by the ETFs will die by them as well. A lot less money will come out of the ETFs than went in. When ETF buyers turn into sellers, there won't be enough demand in the spot market to allow an exit. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) March 4, 2024   The premier digital currency surpassed crucial resistance levels, with Bitcoin (BTC) achieving its highest value  since November 2021, momentarily reaching $68,848.62. Ethereum (ETH), too, saw substantial gains, with an increase of over 5% to $3,650.59. Both cryptocurrencies recorded their most significant weekly growth in almost a year. Bitcoin rose by approximately 21%, and Ethereum by 16%. Despite this, momentum paused over the weekend, as the market adjusted to notable withdrawals  from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which were compensated by capital inflows into the latest Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs)."

Key Takeaways
 MicroStrategy has revealed  its intention to raise $600 million through a bond sale to purchase additional Bitcoin and for “general corporate purposes”. This announcement , made on March 4, marks the firm’s second proposition  to sell $600 million in convertible senior notes in less than a month. MicroStrategy, one of the world’s largest Bitcoin investors  with 193,000 Bitcoin valued at nearly $13 billion, plans to increase its cryptocurrency holdings. The company said  it will issue unsecured senior obligations to qualified institutional buyers, with notes set to mature  in 2030. Following the announcement, MicroStrategy’s stock experienced a significant 25% increase on Monday. This move coincided with Bitcoin’s rise to $67,000, nearing its November 2021 all-time high. ❤💛💚💙 Microstrategy chart for the past 25years is insane. Crazy… and now pumping pic.twitter.com/su48MfF8I4  — yourfriendSOMMI ❤️💛💚💙 (@yourfriendSOMMI) March 5, 2024   Unsecured senior notes , the method of fundraising chosen by MicroStrategy, are loans that do not require collateral. This means they are different from secured senior notes that are backed by specific assets. Despite offering less security than other debt instruments, these notes promise investors a higher return rate. MicroStrategy said the notes will accrue interest, which will be paid out twice a year in arrears on March 15 and September 15, starting from September 15. MicroStrategy has announced an additional incentive  for early buyers, granting them the option to acquire up to $90 million more in notes.

It noted there were no guarantees regarding the finalization, timing, or terms of the offering. The surge in Bitcoin’s demand, propelling its price beyond the $68,000 threshold, has been significantly influenced by various factors. Key drivers include the successful launch of 10 US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January and the anticipation of the halving event expected to occur in late April. #Bitcoin  is about to break its ATH.

Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin experienced a significant increase  at the beginning of the week, nearing its all-time high as the momentum from its previous rally resumed after a pause over the weekend. The leading digital currency wasup by 9% at $68,635.20, as reported  by CoinMarketCap. The Bitcoin (BTC) price soared to its highest level since November 2021 , reaching up to $68,848.62 at one point. Meanwhile, Ethereum saw a more than 5% increase, advancing to $3,650.59. Both cryptocurrencies experienced their most significant weekly gains in almost a year, with Bitcoin surging by approximately 21% and ETH by 16%. However, their upward trajectory took a brief pause over the weekend. This pause came as the market adjusted to two days of sharp withdrawals from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which were balanced by investments into other emerging Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto exchange Nexo said : “What we’re seeing today … might well be a rerun of early last week when bitcoin surged $10,000 in the space of a couple of days. We’re in that sort of environment when a day or two of sideways consolidation can precede explosive price action thanks to the voracious demand of these new spot ETFs.” Bradley Howell , Head of OTC, at digital asset market maker Keyrock  told CCN this latest cryptocurrency market rally was led by Bitcoin. He noted that BTC saw a 28% price increase over the previous seven days, at the time of writing (March 5 2024). “This BTC-led rally appears to be driven primarily by strong inflows into BTC ETF products, which hit a new high on Wednesday of $673.4m. Meanwhile, other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, XRP, and AVAX have mildly underperformed Bitcoin’s gains, increasing 16%, 19%, and 17% respectively over the past week.” He added: “This lends further evidence that Bitcoin ETF inflows are likely the main fuel behind this broader crypto market uptrend. Outliers have been Solana and Cadano, which have rallied 31 and 37% respectively over the past 7 days. Additionally, typically trivial “meme coins” like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Pepe have seen outsized gains of 97-450% in the last week, indicating a resurgence of retail activity. With both institutional and retail flows moving higher, this could lead to some interesting weeks ahead.” Bitcoin’s recent price rally not only elevated its own value but also helped lift other cryptocurrency tokens, particularly memecoins. Dogecoin (DOGE) witnessed a 32% increase , whereas Shiba Inu (SHIB) soared  by 95%. Analysts interpret these movements as signs that retail investors, largely absent during the earlier phases of the crypto rally, are beginning to re-enter the market. This shift is underscored by a surge in memecoin’s weekly trade volume. This metric reached its highest point since late 2021, according to cryptocurrency data provider Kaiko. 📊#Meme  tokens weekly trade volume surged to $37bn last week, its highest level since late 2021. pic.twitter.com/Jd6bNkOGkW  — Kaiko (@KaikoData) March 4, 2024   In tandem with the rise in token values, some cryptocurrency-related stocks also benefited from Bitcoin’s momentum. Notably, Coinbase  and Microstrategy  saw their stock prices climb by 11% and 23.6%, respectively. On the flip side, mining companies did not partake in the rally, relinquishing earlier gains. The looming halving event in April, set to cut mining revenues, exerted downward pressure on investor sentiment. Consequently, mining companies such as CleanSpark and Cipher Mining experienced declines of over 7% each, with Iris Energy and Marathon Digital nearly dropping by 5%, and Riot Platforms falling almost 7%. Why are the #Bitcoin  miners so weak again? They are getting killed even as Bitcoin is up big and other Bitcoin related stocks are hitting record highs. If I was long Bitcoin I would be worried about this divergence. It could be a sign of trouble ahead for Bitcoin itself. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) March 4, 2024   Analysts are speculating that, while Bitcoin may continue its upward trajectory in the short term, its growth could moderate  in the coming weeks due to approaching extreme levels of unrealized profit margins. According to CryptoQuant , Bitcoin’s realized price is currently around $42,700. Despite these short-term projections, long-term investors remain optimistic. They believe the rising demand for Bitcoin, fueled by new US ETFs, combined with a diminishing supply expected after April’s halving event, will propel Bitcoin’s value to new heights. Additionally, the cryptocurrency market has been buoyed by the stock market’s performance, particularly the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite , which reached an all-time high on Friday, marking the last major stock index to achieve a record close this year."
2024-04-19 13:24:00+00:00,Bitcoin Price Rally Ensures 100% of Holders Profit,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-price-rally-ensures-holders-profit/,"
Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin’s price rally has ensured that 100% of its holders are now in profit. This figure was calculated by comparing the current price of Bitcoin to the average cost at which tokens were acquired. While there are indicators of bullish momentum for Bitcoin, it contrasts sharply with the skepticism still echoed by traditional institutions. Bitcoin price has reached a profitability point for all investors. If the market price exceeds the average purchase price, the holder is deemed “In the Money,” making a profit on their investment. According  to IntoTheBlock analysis, the current market price of Bitcoin is higher than the price at which all holders initially bought their tokens. None of the holders are at a loss or breaking even at current price levels. Considering Bitcoin is approaching its next halving event, the indicator is deemed bullish. Meanwhile, the money flowing in and out of cryptocurrency exchanges also backs the positive outlook. Over the week to March 4, exchanges have seen a total of $19.79 billion entering and $20.7 billion leaving them. This net outflow suggests more investors are choosing to hold onto their BTC, possibly in anticipation of further price increases, rather than cashing out. The current market optimism comes days after the European Central Bank (ECB) criticized Bitcoin. In a recent blog post, ECB officials argued  that Bitcoin’s fair value is still zero. The articled labeled BTC a speculative bubble that has failed to fulfill its promise as a decentralized digital currency. The ECB’s cautionary stance underlines the ongoing debate between traditional financial authorities and the digital market after the regulatory approval of Bitcoin ETF. According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin is currently navigating through a Pre-Halving Rally, a period characterized by hype-driven investments. Historically, this phase leads to a short-term drop just before the Halving event, followed by a longer period of re-accumulation and, eventually, a parabolic upturn. The Bitcoin halving event should take place in April 2024. That said, according  to Coinshares, digital asset investment products recently experienced nearly record-breaking inflows. In the last seven days, these inflows amounted to $1.84 billion, with trading volumes surging to over $30 billion. A significant portion of these inflows, 94% or $1.73 billion, was directed towards Bitcoin. Overall, the total assets under management for digital assets is at $82.6 billion, approaching the November 2021 record of $86 billion. The current Bitcoin price rally has not only made every holder profitable but has also reignited warnings of speculative bubbles. Meanwhile, the exchange and on-chain movements and investor sentiment suggest that the trajectory will continue to go up. In this cycle, the Bitcoin halving is dictating how BTC reacts in 2024.  "
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Dogecoin Founder Calls Bitcoin Maximalists ‘Mentally Ill’,https://www.ccn.com/news/dogecoin-founder-calls-bitcoin-maximalists-mentally-ill/,"Unsurprisingly, conflicts and heated arguments frequently arise in the volatile and unpredictable world of cryptocurrency – this time between Dogecoin founder and Bitcoin maximalists. These arguments often show the variety of viewpoints within the crypto community since fervent believers drive them on all sides. Dogecoin founder, who isn’t one to hold back when airing his opinions, has once again criticized the advertising tactics and overarching stories that Bitcoin advocates champion. In the brief video , Robert Breedlove, a BTC maximalist, was seen speaking with Jason Lowery, who continued praising Bitcoin. According to Lowery, BTC is not a coin; rather, it is the future of conflict, security, and those who want to protect their data. Bitcoin (BTC) maximalists, often known as “Bitcoin Maxis,” are ardent proponents of the cryptocurrency and firmly think that it is superior to all others. They frequently minimize or even reject the worth and potential of other tokens in the wide crypto ecosystem because of their steadfast faith in Bitcoin. Markus cited  an occasion where a BTC enthusiast was advocating the cryptocurrency in an effort to shed insight on the thinking of these Bitcoiners. The enthusiast extended an invitation to others to join the “mentally ill group of insecure losers.” Such utterances offer a window into the frequently divisive opinions of some inside the crypto community. Bitcoin maximalists frequently disparage competing cryptocurrencies using the nickname “s-coins.” The person who most exemplifies this approach is Max Keiser, a well-known member of the Bitcoin community. He once requested  that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) order major cryptocurrency exchanges to cease operations, referring to them as little more than casinos. Keiser’s ideas, which are similar to those of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, extend to classifying all altcoins as securities. Notably, Keiser had vehemently asserted that XRP was bound for failure and that it was Gensler’s obligation to ensure its demise before Judge Analisa Torres determined that XRP was not a security in July. These stories have influenced the SEC’s recent activities as the organization has increased its examination of the top cryptocurrencies. The most recent criticism from Markus was in response to a video  published by Udi Wertheimer, a crypto Twitter user. Interviewing Jason Lowery was Bitcoin maximalist Robert Breedlove in the video. Lowery complimented Bitcoin and emphasized its unmatched potential throughout the interview. He continued by saying that Bitcoin is more than just a coin. Instead, he characterized it as security, the future of warfare, and a guarantee for people who want to keep their data private. man bitcoiners are the literal worst at marketing  “come join our clearly mentally ill group of insecure losers!” — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) August 12, 2023   Markus, though, appears to have a strong problem with the content of the video based on his comments. Dogecoin founder’s answer, therefore, supports the idea that innovation is not just restricted to Bitcoin. In the cryptocurrency sector, several additional coins and protocols provide distinctive solutions and show great promise. In April this year, Markus criticized  Bitcoin as a currency, claiming there isn’t enough for everyone. The inventor of the most well-known memecoin on the market recently took to Twitter to criticize cryptocurrency and non-fungible token (NFT) investors, claiming that doing so amounts to investing in mental illness. investing in crypto is literally just investing in mental illness  which i suppose is on the rise, so… — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) April 22, 2023   The world is getting dumber and sadder by the day, said Markus, adding that “investing in cryptocurrencies is literally investing in a mental illness, which I assume is on the rise.” Markus then claimed  that since non-fungible tokens (NFT) are a derivative of cryptocurrencies, investing in them causes people to become “even more mentally ill” when challenged about doing so. Markus responded to criticism of his restrictions by saying he was disgusted by the investors who, in his view, quarrel, behave erratically, and make poor choices as a result of an issue with the brain. The Dogecoin creator’s remarks have been provoking a flood of criticism from irate investors, who claimed that Markus was merely venting his rage at not being able to become wealthy with cryptocurrencies despite having knowledge of the sector for almost a decade. Shortly after Dogecoin’s debut, the project’s inventor said  he quit investing in cryptocurrencies nine years ago. because he thinks investing in digital currency is just another form of gambling for people. Additionally, he rejects Bitcoin as a kind of money. On Reddit, he revealed  he no longer represents the Dogecoin Foundation and owns very little Dogecoin. For his criticism of Dogecoin supporter and billionaire Elon Musk, Jackson Palmer was blocked by Markus last year on Twitter. Palmer slammed Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, for his coding abilities and said he used cryptocurrency to inflate his ego. The majority of cryptocurrency investors, who think that digital currencies are the future of banking and investing, hold the opposite perspective to Markus’ criticism of cryptocurrency investing. Although Bitcoin continues to lead the way in the cryptocurrency world, many different types exist. Billy Markus reminds the public that creativity is not limited to a certain token or protocol. Understanding and appreciating the numerous prospects and potentials presented by different cryptocurrencies is crucial as the cryptosphere continues to develop. The continuous arguments and conflicts, like the one between Markus and Bitcoin maximalists, show stakeholders’ passion and commitment to their individual coins."

Key Takeaways
 Crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments wants the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve options for its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The decision could potentially open doors for a broader investor base and integrate Bitcoin further into the regulated financial market. However, Bitcoin’s commodity  classification and Grayscale’s legal battle with the SEC have set precedents for the outcome. Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein has argued that disallowing options on its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust would be discriminatory to shareholders, especially since the SEC has approved options for ETFs linked to Bitcoin futures. He emphasized that options trading would benefit investors by providing additional regulated avenues for participation. Grayscale sent letter to SEC saying rejection of options on GBTC would “unfairly discriminate"" against its shareholders… Noted SEC approved options on bitcoin futures ETFs. Another potential lawsuit? via @hannahdlang  pic.twitter.com/w8uBjKrQfF  — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) February 29, 2024   He said, “It is vital to the interests of GBTC and all spot Bitcoin [exchange-traded product] investors to access exchange-listed options on GBTC and other spot Bitcoin ETPs.” Options are contracts giving the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specific price within a certain time frame. For Grayscale, offering BTC options would allow investors to make decisions around Bitcoin’s price volatility. It means that Grayscale can potentially benefit from increasing trading volume and reducing price swings. In February, the SEC started soliciting public commentary on a proposed rule change to permit options listing and trading for Bitcoin ETFs. The notice  explained the approval would bring options on Bitcoin ETF at par with options on other ETFs, including those based on commodities. This would prove positive for Bitcoin’s accessibility. The SEC’s approval might not be the final step, however. This is because Bitcoin’s status as a commodity means the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) might also need to sign the approval off. Grayscale’s judiciary victory from 2023 might also set a precedent. Previously, an appellate court overturned a lower court’s decision, siding with Grayscale, who said the SEC’s rejection of their Bitcoin ETF proposal was inconsistent. It potentially smoothens the path for future approvals. The trading volumes for Bitcoin ETFs have reached peak levels. However, Grayscale-backed ETF experienced huge outflows despite a reduction in the rate of negative fund flows in the past. Commentators have partly attributed the weakness to Genesis Bankruptcy. That said, GBTC is trading at a discount to its net asset value (NAV), based on yCharts data. A discount means the market price is lower than the value of the Bitcoin it holds at the time of publication. CoinGlass’ Options/(Perps+Futures) OI Ratio, which compares the value of open options contracts to futures and perpetual contracts, is increasing. A rise suggests a growing impact of options trading on the underlying Bitcoin prices, particularly as the ratio approaches or exceeds the key threshold of 1. Since the last quarter of 2022, the impact has been notable in the chart. Grayscale’s push for SEC approval of Bitcoin ETF options comes at a time of peaking Bitcoin ETF interest. A favorable court ruling in a past case and a decrease in negative fund flows could add confidence that the SEC’s decision might be in favor. The growing Options/(Perps+Futures) OI Ratio indicates that options traders could also impact the spot Bitcoin ETF market. But right now, a clear decision might not come from the SEC due to Bitcoin’s commodity status and a CFTC commentary might be expected."

Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin price performance stayed strong on its path to $64,000. However, it encountered a pause in its rise on March 1, largely due to significant outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). On February 29, the spot Bitcoin ETF saw a net outflow of $600 million leading to consolidation. Moving forward, Bitcoin should to respond to long-term stimuli like its halving and continued institutional interest in ETFs. Bitcoin’s price rise stalling can be directly linked to substantial outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. On February 29, Bloomberg data said GBTC experienced daily net outflows nearing $600 million. Despite the outflows, there was a notable $92m  positive flow within the ETF market, balancing the scales to some extent. Chunky outflows from Grayscale yesterday but still US$1.9bn net inflows so far this week in the US. pic.twitter.com/Pl3xGD3hca  — James Butterfill (@jbutterfill) March 1, 2024   However, since Grayscale’s significant outflows offset the Blackrock inflows, it affected the overall market sentiment. Not only that, but it also contributed to the price consolidation. A key concern for Bitcoin’s rally is the current trading volume, which is significantly lower than during previous peaks. Crypto commentator Hitesh  pointed out that, while Bitcoin has once again surpassed the $60,000 mark, the daily trading volume was close to $280 billion. The figure is reportedly 66% lower than in 2021 during the last price peak with a volume of over $850 billion. This suggests a thinner trading volume supports the current price increase, potentially indicating a weaker rally. According to CoinGecko market cap and volume charts from 2020 to 2024, crypto reached its peak in November 2021. At the time, the volume stood at around $125 billion with a $3 trillion market cap. On February 29, the volume was around $124 billion with a $2.4 trillion market cap.  Exchange inflows, which represent funds moving into exchanges, have seen a 103% increase over the seven days to March 1. Based on data by IntoTheBlock , the spikes in inflows often precede periods of heightened volatility. With inflows totaling $17.57 billion and outflows at $18.18 billion during the same period, there’s a clear indication that some holders might be preparing to sell, adding to the selling pressure on Bitcoin. Despite these challenges, the outlook for Bitcoin remains optimistic in the long run. However, Blockstream CEO Adam Back puts a cap on Bitcoin price at $100,000. He says Bitcoin will rally to the level by April’s halving. The prediction is supported by factors like traders who bet against Bitcoin (leveraged shorts), a wait-and-see approach by raising profit-taking thresholds, over-the-counter (OTC) desks witnessing coin shortage, and buy orders for Bitcoin ETFs. $100k by halving day. people starting to believe. bears, leveraged shorts rekt, scared-off, profit take limit orders moved upwards or just deleted to wait-and-see; OTC desks out of coins, daily $500m / 10k BTC ETF buy walls. this can gap upwards fast. 51 days to go. pic.twitter.com/621zdz2hPZ  — Adam Back (@adam3us) February 28, 2024   Avinash Shekar, the co-founder and CEO of Pi42, spoke to CCN on the future of Bitcoin price. He said: “With the prices subject to surge in the near future, the anticipation of a rally may push investors to put outsized bets on the asset. “ In conclusion, Bitcoin’s journey to $64,000 has been interrupted by profit-taking trades and ETF outflows, underlined by lower trading volumes, and increased exchange inflows volatility. However, with expert predictions of significant price increases in the future, there ought to be continued interest from investors. Therefore, Bitcoin price could recover in the near-to-mid term."

Key Takeaways
 The face-off between the traditional and digital store of value assets, gold, and Bitcoin has intensified after BTC ETFs began to gain ground over the precious metal. According to  Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas, the shine of Bitcoin ETFs, especially amid the underperformance of gold, signals a potential shift in investor preference. It could be that Bitcoin ETFs flip gold ETFs in assets under management within the next two years. Bitcoin ETFs are edging closer to gold ETFs in terms of assets under management. Gold currently holds the top spot among commodity ETFs, with $92.12 billion spread across 19 funds, as per data by Etfdb.com . In contrast, the broader category of cryptocurrency funds under currency ETFs holds BTC ETF in the category. As per a Dune analytics  dashboard, Bitcoin-specific ETFs like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and iShares Bitcoin Trust are collectively nearing the $50 billion mark.  Assets under management (AUM) refers to the total market value of the investments that a financial institution manages on behalf of its clients. For Bitcoin ETFs, the figure has been arrived at by on-chain holdings. AUM indicates the level of interest and investment in the respective assets, with Bitcoin’s growing numbers reflecting increasing acceptance over traditionally bought gold. Based on rankings by etfdb.com , Crypto ETFs rank eighth in average three-month returns and ninth in both aggregate assets under management (AUM) and average expense ratio across the board. In the category, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust boasts an impressive $24.19 million in total assets, with a year-to-date increase of 55.49%. Bitcoin ETF’s could face an even bigger boom if Morgan Stanley were to enter the race. Major financial institution Morgan Stanley, with over $1.5 trillion in assets under management, is reportedly considering adding spot Bitcoin ETFs to its brokerage platform. This move, if finalized, could significantly increase access to Bitcoin for investors and further legitimize cryptocurrency within the mainstream financial landscape while contributing to the flipening of Gold ETFs. Economist Henrik Zeberg  suggests that the Bitcoin-Gold ratio could soar over 65 times. Economist Peter Schiff, a vocal BTC critic, argues that the shift towards Bitcoin funds from gold stocks is a speculative bet against gold, predicting that a crash in Bitcoin prices will ultimately benefit gold stocks. #Bitcoin –#Gold  ratio – heading towards 65X Enjoy the ride – or fight it?  Your choice! 😉 https://t.co/v4wyiN3dlP  pic.twitter.com/Il8SXk6e1L  — Henrik Zeberg (@HenrikZeberg) February 27, 2024   Schiff said : “The most likely explanation for the weakness in gold stocks is that investors are selling them to buy #BitcoinETFs instead.”  The analysis points to a potential future where Bitcoin could underscore the gold market on the back of its upward trajectory. He predicts this trend will reverse once gold gains momentum, expecting that funds currently invested in Bitcoin ETFs will flow back into gold stocks. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is on a trajectory to reach a new all-time high, with its price near the $63,000 mark at the time of writing (February 29 2024). After peaking at over $68,000 in November 2021, BTC has reached this level for the first time in two years. Bitcoin’s price rise has coincided with a surge in investments into Bitcoin ETFs, setting new benchmarks for both volume and inflow of funds. According  to Bloomberg’s James Seyffart, Bitcoin ETFs witnessed a record $673 million in inflows and $7.7 billion in trading volume on February 29 alone, although there were no new flows into $BTCO specifically. Bitcoin ETFs are making significant strides against traditional gold ETFs. While the outcome of this contest remains to be seen in the long run, the implications for investors and the broader market are evident today.  As Bitcoin approaches new highs, spot ETFs are playing an important entry point into the asset class."

Key Takeaways
 In a move that could potentially bring Bitcoin (BTC) to the masses, Morgan Stanley is reportedly exploring the addition of spot Bitcoin ETFs to its brokerage offerings. Morgan Stanley is a traditional financial institution with assets under management of over $1.5 trillion under its belt. After JP Morgan was part of at least two Bitcoin ETF applicants as AP, expectations around cryptocurrency’s integration into mainstream financial institutions had heightened. With Morgan Stanley, it could further help with Bitcoin’s acceptance. As per media reports, Morgan Stanley is conducting due diligence on the feasibility of offering Bitcoin spot ETFs on its platform. In a recent SEC filing, Morgan Stanley Europe Opportunity Fund Inc stated in Form N-1A , “Bitcoin Exposure: The Fund may have exposure to bitcoin indirectly through cash-settled futures or indirectly through investments in pooled investment vehicles and exchange-traded products that invest in bitcoin (“Bitcoin ETFs”).” However, it’s unclear if this is a concrete interest or a precautionary measure. Earlier in February, Morgan Stanley filed  to offer ETF share classes of its mutual funds, expanding its revenue stream.  Another publication revealed, based on sources, that the large brokerage firm is looking to enter the Bitcoin ETF since its January approval. However, according to investor Fred Krueger, Morgan Stanley and UBS might offer existing ETFs. Two additions to the landscape: Both Morgan Stanley and UBS will allow their customers to purchase ETFs. These will not be two new ETFs (as prev reported) https://t.co/T1sFk11rRQ  — Fred Krueger (@dotkrueger) February 29, 2024   The possibility of Morgan Stanley’s brokerage platform offering Bitcoin ETFs created speculation in the financial community. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, suggests that the inclusion of Bitcoin ETF exposure could serve as a growth strategy for funds. In a thread on X, the analyst said the record Bitcoin ETF volume growth comes likely from genuine buyer interest rather than automated trading or arbitrage strategies. He mentions that traditional brokerage firms are considering offering these products on their platforms due to increasing demand. Balchunas further explained that the hesitation from these firms usually comes from a desire to see a proven track record and to ensure they will profit from offering these products.   Record flow day despite $216m out of $GBTC . Impressive. Only one or two other ETFs on the planet are taking in cash as fast as $IBIT  right now. Gonna hit $10b tmrw prob. Easily fastest ever at 7 weeks. For context it took $GLD  over two years to hit 10b, VOO over 3 years. 🔥 https://t.co/EYpGTVdR2P  — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) February 29, 2024   Balchunas humorously imagines a scenario where a financial advisor at a firm like Morgan Stanley can’t provide a product like $IBIT to a client because their platform hasn’t approved it yet, likening it to a child being restricted by a parent, which could be quite an awkward and uncomfortable position for the advisor. The news has gathered attention from community figures like Anthony Scaramucci, who praised Morgan Stanley’s progressive stance. Meanwhile, the role of JPMorgan as an Authorized Participant in Bitcoin ETF applications, despite CEO Jamie Dimon’s skeptical view of Bitcoin, makes it less surprising for traditional financial giants to benefit from digital offerings. I asked around to some mkt makers and most say this volume is largely function of natural demand vs algo/arb type volume. Word is wirehouse platforms are seriously looking at adding them soon. I'm sure pressure is mounting for them. They like to see track record and get paid off… — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) February 28, 2024   Morgan Stanley’s potential venture into Bitcoin ETF offerings could mark another shift if the filing disclaimer is not just meant to be a risk mitigation exercise. As the broker-dealer giant contemplates this move, there will be broader implications for the Bitcoin ETF market, which is already booming."

Key Takeaways
 The Bitcoin price is seeing a remarkable uptick and has climbed close to $63,000 at the time of writing (February 29 2024). The rise comes more than two years after the cryptocurrency’s all-time high of just over $68,000 in November 2021. While BTC is only 9% away from the peak, several factors, including record inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and the anticipation of the BTC halving event, have contributed to this bullish momentum. Bitcoin’s trading volume surpassed $95 billion in the last 24 hours to February 29. Robert Kiyosaki, author of the personal finance book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” recognized this bullish trend, while criticizing the US dollar. Thank you BITCOiN for doing your job….kicking the fake US dollar’s butt and bringing integrity back to money. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) February 29, 2024    The cumulative cryptocurrency market cap hit $3 trillion in November 2021. While it has almost touched the $2.5 trillion mark at the time of writing, we must remember its steep decline in 2022. The market cap bottomed out at less than $800 billion due to the collapse of the FTX exchange. In the weeks following the collapse in November 2022, Bitcoin’s price dipped below $16,000. This downturn was driven by investor uncertainty over the potential fallout from FTX’s financial troubles and Binance’s pullout from a rescue plan. The recent peak in Bitcoin’s price correlates with record inflows into BTC ETFs. BitMEX Research highlighted   record inflows of $673.4 million, predominantly driven by Blackrock’s significant contribution of $612.1 million, on February 28. This influx of institutional capital is an indicator of growing investor interest, significantly affecting Bitcoin’s valuation. Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures, told CCN: “Crypto Spring has arrived early in 2024, as the spot BTC ETFs continue to gain investor interest and are the primary reason for the current surge in BTC prices. The spot ETFs have brought in a wave of institutional capital into the asset class and we are seeing strong inflows daily.” Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX, echoed the sentiment, adding, “While Bitcoin maintains its dominance, there’s palpable excitement surrounding the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval, sparking renewed interest in Altcoins. This collective optimism is driving increased market participation, potentially leading to broader gains across the entire ecosystem.” BitInfoCharts data revealed 618,364 BTC, valued at around $38.73 billion—or 3.15% of Bitcoin’s total market cap—was sent. The activity heightened trading volume when the average is 16,145 transactions per hour. Despite the surge, the cost of transactions remains high. The average transaction fee for Bitcoin stands at 0.00014 BTC, or $8.58. This indicates a sustained demand for network space at 55.2 sats/vB. Bitcoin's price surges ahead of halving, but network fees lag behind.  Data from BitInfoCharts reveals the average cost to send #Bitcoin  is $7.01 today, compared to $37 two months ago during NFT-like Ordinals. pic.twitter.com/aJZEILK7US  — Bitinning (@bitinning) February 29, 2024     That said, momentum remains bullish. Blackrock is reported to hold approximately $9 billion in BTC, while Fidelity’s holds around $6 billion. These figures are notably high for an ETF that has just been introduced. He added that the surge in demand along with the supply shock related to the BTC halving event will result in price growth. In response, Gupta told us the spot market volume of Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX has gone up 150% amid the interest. Bitcoin’s journey from its lows to nearing its all-time high in two years is keeping the community confident about the asset’s dominance. The role of institutional investments, coupled with the scheduled BTC halving, is a potentially transformative period for Bitcoin and the broader market. The next few months could be critical in determining the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin’s value."

Key Takeaways
 In a forecast shared  on Twitter, whistleblower Edward Snowden predicts 2024 will see a national government acquire Bitcoin (BTC). This bold assertion  highlights a potential turning point in the adoption of digital currencies by sovereign states, signaling a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s value on a governmental level. Edward Snowden’s prediction  emerges at a time when Bitcoin is witnessing heightened interest from various sectors, including institutional investors, retail participants, and even nation-states, with numerous prominent companies making investments to the cryptocurrency. Prediction: A national government will be revealed this year to have been buying Bitcoin—the modern replacement for monetary gold—without having disclosed that fact publicly. — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) February 28, 2024   Although Snowden did not pinpoint which national government he anticipates will engage in Bitcoin acquisition, another country following El Salvador’s lead would mark another step in Bitcoin’s journey towards mainstream acceptance. Snowden said:  “Prediction: A national government will be revealed this year to have been buying Bitcoin—the modern replacement for monetary gold—without having disclosed that fact publicly,” In response to Bitcoin’s recent surge, El Salvador’s President, Nayib Bukele, spoke about the country’s BTC investment. He pointed out  that critics previously focused extensively on El Salvador’s potential losses when Bitcoin’s value was lower. Now, however, with the price significantly higher, the country stands to profit more than 40% from its purchases. When #Bitcoin ’s market price was low, they wrote literally thousands of articles about our supposed losses. Now that #Bitcoin ’s market price is way up, if we were to sell, we would make a profit of over 40% (just from the market purchases), and our main source of BTC is now our… — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) February 28, 2024   Bukele emphasized  El Salvador’s primary Bitcoin acquisition method is through its citizenship program. Despite the potential for profit, he affirmed the country’s commitment to holding onto its Bitcoin assets. He underscored the constancy of Bitcoin’s value , stating “1 BTC = 1 BTC”. This highlights its value regardless of market fluctuations, while noting the silence of earlier critics in the bull market. El Salvador’s strategic embrace of Bitcoin has yielded benefits, extending well beyond BTC’s mere rise in value. The country has experienced a surge in tourism, particularly from Bitcoin enthusiasts. Not only that, but there is also an influx of investments attributed to its cryptocurrency adoption. This could be catching the eyes of other nations, contemplating the potential uplift Bitcoin could bring to their own economies. As the prediction by Edward Snowden gains traction, it highlights the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin within the mainstream financial landscape and its capacity to revolutionize conventional economic frameworks."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Over $60,000: Why it Hit November 2021 Peak And What Drives It Now",https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-price-over-60000-november-2021-peak/,"
Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin experienced a significant increase  on Wednesday, surpassing the $63,000 mark for the first time since November 2021. The leading cryptocurrency’s price was last recorded up by nearly 6% at $60,356.75, based on CoinMarketCap data . It momentarily reached $64,000 earlier before declining. The price is approaching its record high of $68,982.20. The volatile price fluctuations have been impacting both optimistic and pessimistic traders. Within the last 24 hours, centralized exchanges saw short position liquidations  amounting to $176 million and long position liquidations totaling $86.1 million, as reported by CoinGlass . When traders employ leverage to bet against Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency’s value increases, they are compelled to purchase Bitcoin from the market to close their positions. This action drives the price higher, triggering further liquidations of similar positions. On the other hand, traders who speculate on a price rise are forced to sell their holdings to mitigate losses. As Bitcoin approaches its record high, the market’s enthusiasm  to revisit this peak has intensified. This week, Bitcoin has surged by nearly 20%, marking an increase of more than 40% in 2024. Antoni Trenchev, cofounder of crypto exchange Nexo, anticipates some resistance  as Bitcoin nears the $69,000 mark. However, he believes surpassing the $60,000 threshold has revitalized investors interest. He said this was especially  true forthose from the retail sector who had previously remained on the sidelines. JPMorgan notes a resurgence in retail investors’ interest in cryptocurrencies this month, following a lull in January. Investor anticipation is building for Bitcoin, fueled by the launch of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and the network’s forthcoming halving event. Such halvings have historically preceded significant market rallies. Zach Pandl, the head of research at Grayscale Investments, highlights  the surge in Bitcoin demand against a backdrop of diminishing supply. The introduction of new U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs has seen an influx of approximately $195 million daily in February. This contrasts with the Bitcoin network’s current production rate of around 900 coins per day, valued at roughly $54 million at a $60,000 price point. With the Bitcoin halving slated for April, the market faces a crunch in supply against burgeoning demand. This imbalance between supply and demand is propelling prices upwards, as there won’t be enough Bitcoin to meet the incoming wave of interest. The upcoming halving event, a built-in feature of the Bitcoin protocol, should cut the BTC mining reward in half to help control the cryptocurrency’s supply. This event, expected in April, aims to limit the influx of new bitcoins into the market. Following a significant rise in Bitcoin’s value, related stocks initially experienced a boost, though they later saw some of their gains retract after Bitcoin’s price corrected. Microstrategy, known for its substantial Bitcoin holdings, saw an increase of 10.5%, while Marathon Digital, a mining company, appreciated by 2.4%. Block, which offers Bitcoin trading services and includes Bitcoin in its assets, saw a near 1% rise. However, Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, witnessed a partial reversal of its gains following reports from users about seeing zero balances and encountering issues with transactions. Despite these challenges, it managed to close the day with a 0.8% increase."

Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin recently experienced a significant surge, with its value soaring over almost 5% in the last 24 hours alone. Such a remarkable price increase is uncommon in the financial markets, particularly without any clear catalysts. This unexpected jump has caught the attention of investors and market watchers alike, highlighting the market’s unpredictable nature. Despite the lack of an immediate, identifiable reason for this spike, the movement underscores the factors driving the crypto sector. Here, sentiment and speculative interest can lead to rapid price changes. So who is still pre-rich and who is now rich? pic.twitter.com/EFc7sboQRN  — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) February 28, 2024   Crypto investor Anthony Pompliano said  Bitcoin’s rapid appreciation over the recent weeks can be attributed to several factors. These, he claimed, reflected the complex interplay of market dynamics, investor sentiment, and macroeconomic influences. He said : “The common answer is that the bitcoin spot ETFs have led to significant demand for the asset. This answer is not wrong. Yesterday we saw $520 million in net inflows to the ETFs.” Pompliano also mentioned  BitMEX Research  that highlighted a staggering fact. The data found that the net inflow of capital into Bitcoin equates to 9,510 Bitcoins. This figure figure that dwarfs the daily production of the Bitcoin network, which stands at 900 new Bitcoins per day. 🚨 Bitcoin May Be Sounding The Alarm On Inflation  Bitcoin went vertical yesterday.

While such a supply-demand imbalance might have been expected in the initial days following the launch of Bitcoin ETFs, the continuation of this trend 45 days after the ETFs’ introduction is astonishing, underscoring the intense and sustained interest in Bitcoin investment. Bitcoin spot ETFs have seen a historic influx, surpassing $6 billion in cumulative net inflows since their inception. Leading the charge, Blackrock’s fund boasts $7.2 billion in assets, with five ETFs each holding at least $1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). This monumental achievement marks the Bitcoin spot ETFs as the most successful ETF launch in history by nearly every metric.

While the straightforward answer might suggest institutions are simply seizing the opportunity to invest in a top-performing asset, Pompliano believes this doesn’t fully capture the essence of the current trend. He hints at a more profound reason behind the mass adoption of Bitcoin. Pompliano suggested it might be linked to anticipations of an inflation resurgence. Investors, wary of inflation’s potential impact on their portfolios, may be turning to Bitcoin as a safeguard against the looming threat, a perspective that could redefine the narrative around Bitcoin’s recent popularity surge. Pompliano revisited 2020, when the pandemic  severely impacted the economy. This prompted government and central banks to inject trillions in monetary and fiscal stimulus into the market. Despite official assurances downplaying inflation concerns and later claims of inflation being “transitory,” seasoned investors like Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller publicly warned  of impending inflation on CNBC. Not only that, but they also advocated for Bitcoin for inflation hedging. This foresight proved accurate as Bitcoin’s value skyrocketed  from around $8,000 in the summer of 2020, when inflation was below 2%, to $64,000 by March 2021—an eightfold increase. This surge was largely attributed to the market’s ability to anticipate future trends, with investors purchasing Bitcoin aggressively to shield themselves from the anticipated inflation. Pompliano suggests  this move is happening again, despite the Federal Reserve’s efforts  to curb inflation and media reports of declining year-over-year CPI. Echoing insights from @WinfieldSmart , he highlights the risk of inflation’s return, noting the sharp increase in ISM services prices as a reliable indicator for future inflation. Inflation resurfacing is a real risk today ISM services prices has been an accurate leading indicator for inflation And it has just moved up sharply ht g.o.t. pic.twitter.com/qxc6efZtph  — Win Smart, CFA (@WinfieldSmart) February 27, 2024   Pompliano points out that while Bitcoin ETFs are currently in the spotlight due to their measurable capital inflows and performance beyond expectations, there’s more to the story than just Wall Street’s influence driving up Bitcoin prices to prompt sales. He warns against simplifying the rally to mere speculative interest from large investors. Pompliano highlighted the substantial risk of inflation hidden within the economy. He pointed that seasoned investors recognize the signs and won’t the market should not surprise them again. Pompliano summed up the situation with a list of contributing factors. He claimed inflation, ETFs, media focus, liquidated shorts, and reflexivity were all playing their part. He also suggested the current scenario was aligning perfectly with Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision  for Bitcoin."

 Justin Sun, the founder of TRON, revealed  to his 3.5 million Twitter followers that he possesses more than 28,000 Bitcoin, worth around $1.6 billion. This announcement  comes at a time when Bitcoin’s value is experiencing a notable increase, spurred by a substantial wave of investments into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs receiving approval last month. In a revealing post on X , Justin Sun said he owned 28,613.74 Bitcoins. This announcement was made shortly after Bitcoin’s price  soared past the $55,000 mark, sparking significant enthusiasm within the cryptocurrency sector. Also, the Bitcoin price didn’t stop.

Justin Sun 孙宇晨 (@justinsuntron) February 27, 2024   Analysts forecast that the market capitalization of Bitcoin could hit $1.5 trillion, fueled by increases in spot Bitcoin ETFs offered by BlackRock, Grayscale, and other financial entities. Justin Sun’s prominence in the cryptocurrency sector leads to conjecture regarding his transactions and holdings, alongside their possible effects on the broader market. A recent spike in cryptocurrency prices resulted in liquidations exceeding $380 million on February 27. Of this, long positions faced $109 million in liquidations , whereas short positions suffered more significantly, with losses amounting to $271 million. Last year, Sun withdrew  $6 million worth of SHIB from Binance in two separate transactions. Despite concerns that such withdrawals from centralized exchanges could trigger supply shocks, SHIB’s price remained unaffected. The year also saw Sun facing regulatory action  from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In April 2023, allegations surfaced against Sun for trading Tronix and BitTorrent tokens without proper securities registration. Additionally, Sun’s ownership of the Huobi exchange has been shrouded in speculation and mystery. In August 2023, amid rumors of insolvency, there was speculation about Sun transferring $200 million in USDT to the exchange. Moreover, Sun faced accusations of not disclosing payments to celebrities, including Lindsay Lohan  and Austin Malone, for endorsing cryptocurrency assets and products, further complicating his legal and financial landscape."

 The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has seen notable outflows since its January listing. Meanwhile, the other nine Bitcoin ETFs have experienced inflows since their debut. With a Bitcoin price rally, some analysts predict that the Bitcoin ETF inflow will increase in March as per the current momentum.

Contrastingly, the wider US Bitcoin ETF market has experienced a remarkable surge in activity. Analyst James Seyffart cites Cointucky Derby to update an inflow of over $580 million into US Bitcoin ETFs, signaling a positive investor appetite on a net basis.  Seyffart noted: “Over $1 billion in gross inflows against $436 million in gross outflows for $GBTC.” #Bitcoin  ETFs Saw a massive net inflow of +$520M yesterday.$GBTC  Almost came down entirely and only had a -$22.4M outflow.

Bloomberg cites GBTC’s higher management fee of 1.5%, compared to its peers’  sub-0.3% fees as one factor. Moreover, the liquidation of holdings by bankrupt entities, such as Genesis Global Holdco LLC, has adversely affected its appeal. Despite these challenges, GBTC’s outflows have begun to stabilize, which is good news for market recovery. While GBTC faces hurdles in reclaiming its position, the investor base is suggesting a surge in activity.

Further analysis by CoinShares  revealed on Feb 26 notes year-to-date inflows have exceeded $5.7b, with the US seeing the majority at $610m. Despite Grayscale experiencing outflows, the overall market sentiment remains bullish, with minor inflows also noted in Brazil and Switzerland. Bitcoin’s bullish performance above the $51K mark received major support, particularly in the United States. The combination of favorable regulatory developments and increased investment interest led to investment inflows and increased liquidity. Therefore, digital asset-backed ETP launches and favorable push to crypto regulations will expand price impact in the market."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,MicroStrategy S&P 500 Inclusion: Can Bitcoin Bet Push Firm into Largest 500 on Stock Market?,https://www.ccn.com/news/microstrategy-sp500-bitcoin-stock-market/,"Can MicroStrategy, the enterprise analytics software provider with significant Bitcoin holdings, secure a spot on the S&P 500 index? Will Clemente, Co-Founder of Reflexivity Research, ignited the conversation by comparing MicroStrategy’s market capitalization with the S&P 500’s listing threshold. The community hints at the potential inflow of billions of dollars into Bitcoin-related assets upon MicroStrategy’s hypothetical addition to the index. However, despite the buzz surrounding this possibility, there is skepticism despite an anticipated Bitcoin rally in 2024. The S&P 500 index, designed to track the performance of the top 500 large-cap U.S. equities, imposes strict criteria for inclusion. MicroStrategy, as a public company, fulfills several prerequisites, including a minimum market capitalization requirement, positive earnings, and listing on an eligible U.S. exchange. MSTR market cap: ~$12 billionS&P500 new listing threshold: $15.8 billion If MSTR gets added (this cycle?), trillions of passive flows including pension funds, SWFs etc. may all have a levered Bitcoin ETF in their portfolio soon. — Will (@WClementeIII) February 20, 2024   Yet, there are arguments against the theory. MicroStrategy’s primary business focus and its significant exposure to Bitcoin may not align with the index’s traditional composition. A user pointed out that MSTR will not be included for not being “appropriate” despite meeting the minimum market cap criteria and profitability requirements. Despite MicroStrategy’s notable Bitcoin holdings, valued at 190,000 BTC, and its robust market performance, the road to S&P 500 inclusion is unlikely. At the time of writing, MSTR’s current Bitcoin value-to-cost ratio is at a massive 1.65 times. The ratio is based on Bitcoin price of over $51,000, which it touched for the first time in two years, against the acquisition cost of the company. Since reporting its BTC balance on August 11, 2020, MicroStrategy has seen growth in both its Bitcoin holdings and stock price and has outperformed the S&P 500 index on some occasions due to the BTC momentum. As per data by Bitcoin Treasuries, the value of Bitcoin compared to the US dollar has surged by 331%. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy’s stock price soared by 450% in the same timeframe. Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s co-founder and a vocal BTC proponent, continues to be optimistic. In a recent interview with Bloomberg , Saylor emphasized his belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition. He said Bitcoin is the ‘exit strategy’ suggesting the company would keep investing in the digital asset. In addition, he told the paper that Bitcoin ETF approval is “a rising tide that is going to lift all boats.” The discussions surrounding MicroStrategy’s potential inclusion in the S&P 500 index are interesting but unlikely. While MicroStrategy’s substantial Bitcoin holdings and market performance position it as a strong contender, the index’s criteria and traditional composition will present hurdles."

Key Takeaways
 A hefty options play could see a trader make more than $20 million if Bitcoin falls to $47,000 by the end of March. On Tuesday, a trader made a significant Bitcoin (BTC) options transaction , designed to capitalize on an anticipated near-term price drop. Therefore, Bitcoin has now established a baseline at $47,000. The deal involved the purchase of 100 lots of put options for a March 29 expiry. It was made on crypto block trading platform Greeks.Live , with strike prices set at $50,000 and $43,000. Breaking: Bitcoin Options Trader Takes $20M Bet to Hedge Against Prices Dropping to $47K$BTC  is trading above key levels in the $50k-$53k zone. We saw a failed breakout above $53k yesterday which led to a test of support above $50k 📉 The outlook is still bullish, but a… pic.twitter.com/PDACIpuqBr  — Fyda Finance (@fydafinance) February 21, 2024   To help finance this, the trader sold 200 lots of put options with the same expiry at a strike price of $47,000. Put options grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell bitcoin at a specific price on or before a certain date. As a result, it is fair to assume the buyer had a bearish outlook. A substantial transaction , known as a block trade, was executed off the public market for over $20 million, according to Greeks.Live. These are typically associated with institutional investors, due to their large size and execution outside of standard market venues. The deal will maximize profits if Bitcoin’s price hits $47,000 by the expiry date.  This means there is an expectation for a price dip in the coming weeks, but not below the $47,000 mark. The trade structure aims for a peak profit at a specific mid-range price with limited losses at either extreme. The chart resembles the shape of a butterfly, earning it the moniker “butterfly bet.” The payoff projection  for a notable Bitcoin bet highlights maximum gains  if Bitcoin reaches $47,000. On this occasion, the trade will break even at $44,201 and $49,770. It seems it is going this way since, at the time of writing (February 21 2024), the price hovered at around $52,000, According to Adam, an analyst at Greeks.Live, prominent investors are increasingly placing short positions, anticipating a modest decline in bitcoin’s value before March 29. He said: “Recent block trades have been concentrated in two directions – short price or long volatility. Term selection has mostly been concentrated before BTC halving. Looking at the characteristics of the trades, it is likely that traders are holding spot and purchasing hedging positions.”"
2024-04-19 13:24:00+00:00,"Bitcoin Payments: As Coinbase Commerce Drops Native Support for Coin, How Will It Affect BTC Price?",https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-payments-coinbase-commerce-drops-support/,"
Key Takeaways
 Coinbase has announced that its crypto-based retail payments platform, Coinbase Commerce, will drop support for native Bitcoin payments. The move is yet another blow to the cryptocurrency’s function as a peer-to-peer payment platform, which is increasingly eclipsed by another narrative for the technology – Bitcoin as digital gold.  But do BTC payments still have a future? And what does it mean for the market if they don’t? Coinbase Commerce quietly removed support for on-chain Bitcoin payments last week. Bitcoin forks that had previously been integrated on the platform were also affected. The platform said : “You can still accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin and Litecoin as long as your customer has a Coinbase account.”  But that did little to appease Bitcoiners. After all, enabling BTC payments only for people with a Coinbase account contradicts Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision of “allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party”. On February 18, the product lead for Coinbase Commerce, Lauren Dowling, turned to Twitter to explain the decision. While she said the firm was committed to on-chain commerce, she acknowledged it was turning away from what are known as UTXO chains  to focus on Ethereum-compatible cryptos. 4/ Customers can use any self-custody EVM wallet to pay. The fastest checkout is with any native asset or ERC-20 (including Wrapped Bitcoin) on L2s. Customers can also pay with any asset in their Coinbase account (including Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Doge). — Lauren Dowling (@Lauren_Dowling_) February 17, 2024   In place of native UTXO tokens, Dowling suggested using wrapped ERC-20 versions instead. She said: “Customers can use any self-custody EVM wallet to pay. The fastest checkout is with any native asset or ERC-20 (including Wrapped Bitcoin) on L2s.” In line with Dowling’s comments, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said  he believes “paying with crypto is going to primarily happen on Layer 2 in the future.” He added: “Paying for stuff online with crypto won’t really go mainstream until we get off layer 1, and reduce transaction fees and confirmation times, so we’re trying to accelerate the move toward that world. I think the market for people paying for everyday items on layer 1 will be pretty small, regardless of what chain (maybe other than Solana).” For now, that means merchants using Coinbase Commerce won’t be able to accept non-EVM payments.  However, Armstrong said the company is working on integrating Bitcoin Lighting into Coinbase and that “hopefully” there would be opportunities to make Commerce payments with Lightning in the future. While Coinbase Commerce is a popular crypto payment gateway, any impact on transaction volumes is likely to be negligible. As such, news that the platform had ceased supporting on-chain BTC transactions didn’t dampen what was ultimately a bullish week for crypto markets, which saw Bitcoin’s market cap climb above $1 trillion for the first time since 2021. In the end, Armstrong hit the nail on the head with his observation about transaction fees and confirmation times. Sure, there will always be a handful of die-hard Bitcoiners who insist on doing everything on-chain. But for most people, Layer 1 BTC payments are unnecessarily cumbersome when there are so many cheaper, faster alternatives."

Key Takeaways
 The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has imposed  a $1.75M fine on Bitcoin ETF issuer VanEck. The action accuses VanEck of failing to adequately disclose the engagement of a “well-known and controversial” social media influencer who was paid by the index company to promote the ETF. The omission and disclosure requirements are expected to position Bitcoin ETFs alongside traditional financial instruments. Meanwhile, their popularity and the billions of dollars flowing into the Bitcoin funds continue to maintain institutional interest. The VanEck Social Sentiment ETF (NYSE:BUZZ), launched in March 2021, was designed to track an index based on “positive insights” from social media. The index provider, aiming to boost the ETF’s launch, hired influencer Dave Portnoy under a licensing fee structure. The arrangement offered Portnoy a greater percentage of the management fee as the fund grew. However, Van Eck Associates did not disclose these arrangements or the influencer’s involvement to the ETF’s board during the fund’s approval process or when setting the management fee. 🚨NEW: $BTC  Spot ETF issuer @vaneck_us  has agreed to pay a $1.75M civil penalty to the @SECGov  to settle charges that it failed to disclose @stoolpresidente ’s role in the launch of its VanEck Social Sentiment ETF $BUZZ  back in 2021. https://t.co/tu0wvoYLjv  — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) February 16, 2024   Andrew Dean, co-chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Asset Management Unit, highlighted the importance of fund boards receiving accurate disclosures, especially concerning advisory contracts. He pointed out that Van Eck Associates’ failure to provide this information limited the board’s ability to assess the economic implications of the arrangement. The SEC revealed in the press release that VanEck has agreed to a cease-and-desist order and the financial penalty, without admitting or denying the findings. This case can set a precedent for new Bitcoin ETFs to set proper disclosure guidelines for the crypto market. The fine against Van Eck Associates comes at a time when the regulatory environment for crypto-related investment products remains uncertain. The SEC’s cautious approach to Bitcoin ETFs and other products has faced scrutiny. Meanwhile, Bloomberg  revealed in its report that US banks are pushing the SEC for changes in guidance around holding digital assets. A coalition of banking and financial services groups recently sent a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, arguing that the current accounting guidance excludes American banks from serving as asset custodians for Bitcoin ETFs. They are advocating for adjustments that would enable banks to more effectively offer crypto custody services.

Action against VanEck signals continued tightening of rules for crypto market players. And the SEC can likely enforce stricter securities regulations going forward. The case might also set a precedent for Bitcoin ETF players. As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, compliance and transparency are reminders for the Bitcoin ETF players especially when analysts see billions flowing into the ETPs."

Key Takeaways
 Visionary architects and Nobel laureates past predictions on alternative financial systems are resurfacing. Figures like Buckminster Fuller, Henry Ford, and Friedrich Hayek , predicted concepts similar to Bitcoin, with early ideas that shed light on alternative financial systems that empower individuals and challenge traditional paradigms. Fuller , renowned for his innovative architectural designs and theories, reportedly foresaw the emergence of a digital currency system resembling Bitcoin. In a similar vein, Ford , a pivotal figure in industrial innovation, proposed the idea of an energy currency capable of preventing wars, a concept that parallels the peace-promoting potential of cryptocurrency. Nobel Laureate in Economics, Hayek, also contributed to this visionary narrative with his speculation in a 1984 video  about the advent of a new financial system through a “sly, roundabout way” of establishing alternative monetary accounts , hinting at a decentralized currency similar to Bitcoin. These insights from past luminaries underscore the long-standing pursuit of alternative economic systems that challenge traditional financial paradigms and empower individuals globally. Friedrich August von Hayek, known as F. A. Hayek (1899-1992), distinguished himself as a seminal figure in free-market economics and philosophy, studying under Ludwig von Mises  in Vienna. His intellectual journey, enriched by Mises’ seminars and interactions with fellow scholars, led to significant contributions to economic theory, earning him the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences on October 9, 1974. While Milton Friedman is often celebrated for anticipating a system  similar to Bitcoin, Hayek’s insights into decentralized currencies are equally profound. And while Friedmann asserted : “Now, fortunately, law and language have been allowed to develop. Money has originated in its original form, but as soon as it was there in its most primitive form it was frozen.” Hayek commented : “After two or three hundred years of coins, all the governments put their hands in and stopped any further development. Governments said it must not develop any further. We were not allowed to experiment on it. Money hasn’t been improved. Money has become rather worse over time.” Hayek explored the development of societal constructs like law, language, and money, subtly foreshadowing the principles behind Satoshi Nakamoto’s groundbreaking digital currency. The economist highlighted the flaws in the historical approach to currency, primarily issued by governments, labeling these efforts as largely erroneous and abusive. Questioning the efficacy of monetary policy, Hayek expressed skepticism about its benefits, concluding that it has predominantly caused harm. He championed the idea of “denationalizing money ” to mitigate these issues. When asked about the feasibility of private institutions like Chase issuing their currency, Hayek suggested a transformative vision for the future of finance. “While the governments can stop people from issuing money, they can hardly stop them from opening accounts into something. After all, in a modern world hand to hand money, coins, and paper are no longer the most important,” Hayek explained . ""Nobel prize laureate Friedrich Hayek in his famous work proves that the existence of concurrent independent currencies has a huge positive effect. Each currency issuer (or developer in our case) is trying to attract users by improving his product. Currency is like a commodity:… pic.twitter.com/SakvUcPuUm  — Hugo Quinteiro ⚡ (@Hugo_Quinteiro) February 6, 2024   The economist elaborated  on the evolving landscape of finance, suggesting that credits and credit cards serve as modern substitutes for traditional currency. He proposed moving beyond the current monetary system and banks, envisioning a new system of accounts that could effectively replace money as we know it. He said : “I don’t believe that we shall ever have good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of the government. We can’t take them violently out of the hands of the government, [then] all we can do is by some sly, roundabout way [and] introduce something they can’t stop.” In his groundbreaking work “The Denationalisation of Money ” (1976) and its refined argument in 1978, Friedrich Hayek made a compelling case against government monopolies on currency creation. He argued for a revolutionary shift to a fully privatized monetary system, where the production, distribution, and regulation of currency would be governed by the principles of the free market. Hayek believed that such a laissez-faire approach  to money would foster unprecedented innovation in the monetary sector. After Friedrich Hayek’s passing, efforts to privatize currency in the United States, such as Bernard von NotHaus’s Liberty Dollar  and the E-gold  digital exchange, faced significant governmental resistance, leading to legal actions and shutdowns. These initiatives aimed to establish currencies backed by tangible assets like precious metals but were accused of facilitating illegal activities, including money laundering. In stark contrast, Bitcoin emerged in 2009 as a decentralized digital currency, with no central authority, fulfilling Hayek’s vision of a system that could bypass traditional money. Created  by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto amidst the financial turmoil of the Great Recession, Bitcoin represented a radical departure from previous attempts at currency privatization, embodying an innovative approach to financial systems outside government control."

Crypto community members allege that the Energy Information Administration (EIA) has mandated miners to disclose their location and hashrate. The move has sparked widespread concern regarding privacy and the security of assets. Balaji Srinivasan, a crypto commentator and former Coinbase CTO, has voiced concerns, drawing parallels to firearms registration. Srinivasan suggests that US miners might need to consider relocating to states where property rights are more secure. In a February release, the EIA said that it will conduct mandatory surveys to evaluate crypto mining energy consumption. The agency’s call for detailed disclosures has left the crypto community uneasy. In a post on X, Srinivasan said, “As with firearms, registration enables confiscation.” The crypto commentator hinted at miners relocating to red states considering their stricter property rights. Crypto influencer Dennis Porter claimed  that miners are receiving letters from the EIA that could impose hefty fines for non-compliance. Porter notes that the EIA categorizes mining as a potential public threat. They argue that rather than stifling innovation, the government should recognize the potential benefits of Bitcoin mining, such as its ability to balance the grid and mitigate methane emissions. Get out of blue states while it is still feasible to do so. Minimize your physical, social, financial, and legal dependencies on Blue America. As true for companies as it is for miners and for individuals. https://t.co/AhT8o1RwUF  — Balaji (@balajis) February 15, 2024   He argued, “Bitcoin mining has the potential to radically reshape the way that we manage, produce, and transmit energy in the USA.” The current crypto regulations in the US remain murky at best. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s recent comments have done little to clarify the situation, despite the approval of Bitcoin ETFs being seen as a positive step for the market. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has been part of an ongoing debate over the potential introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Representative Tom Emmer and former President Donald Trump have been some of the Republican figures to raise financial privacy and government surveillance concerns. Another reason the upcoming elections will be crucial for the crypto community. I agree with President Trump; CBDCs pose a serious threat to Americans' right to financial privacy.  I look forward to working with him as we continue the fight against the expanding government surveillance state. — Tom Emmer (@GOPMajorityWhip) January 19, 2024    In the meantime, crypto miners are capitalizing on the surge in Bitcoin prices, while mining firms maintain positive action on the stock market. Miners are faced with disclosure challenges ahead of the election season. There is also increased oversight from government agencies amid ongoing debates on financial privacy. Currently, Republicans are positioning themselves as supporters of digital currencies, resisting the regulatory measures proposed under the Biden administration, and opposing a Fed-led digital currency. Meanwhile, advocates are calling to protect the industry’s potential, and the waters can remain turbulent this year."

Key Takeaways
 During a “Squawk Box” interview  on CNBC, news anchor Joe Kernen engaged in a lively debate with SEC Chair Gary Gensler over Bitcoin’s decentralized characteristics. Gensler’s skepticism about the leading cryptocurrency sparked a broad conversation encompassing topics such as cryptocurrency, investor safeguards, and the fresh endorsement of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Gary Gensler’s comments  during the discussion cast doubt on Bitcoin’s widely praised decentralized nature, suggesting that its decentralization may be overstated. “This is a field that's been rife with fraud and manipulation. Look at all the bankruptcies,” says SEC Chair @GaryGensler  on #Crypto . “It's not just one entity. It's after entity after entity lining up in the bankruptcy court.” pic.twitter.com/8Vke1yD2n8  — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) February 14, 2024   He pointed out  that the limited number of exchanges facilitating Bitcoin trades indicates a lesser degree of decentralization than commonly believed. Additionally, Gensler has previously described the concept of spot Bitcoin ETFs as “ironic,” highlighting their centralized characteristics. “It’s not that centralized, Joe,” he said. He emphasized that the decentralized aspect of cryptocurrency primarily pertains to its accounting ledger. This perspective prompted a vigorous response from Joe Kernen, who defended Bitcoin’s decentralized ledger as a key element that enhances its reliability and attractiveness to investors. Kernen commented: “It’s in a ledger that everyone has… that can’t be double-counted. It’s almost immutable, and that’s why people think it has an inherent value.” Kernen also raised a query about the apparent contradiction in stance, questioning why someone who has taught about Bitcoin at MIT would adopt a negative view towards cryptocurrencies. He challenged Gensler indirectly by comparing him with JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon by saying: “You’re so smart. You’re at MIT and people listen what you think about Bitcoin. It’s troublesome to me, if I look at it, and I see all the merits of it, and someone that taught about it and understands it seems to have an opinion that maybe it’s, I don’t know, pet rock-ish or something.” During the interview, Gensler clarified the commission’s neutral stance regarding cryptocurrencies. He explained that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs does not equate to an endorsement of Bitcoin itself but allows for the cryptocurrency’s trading within regulated exchange-traded products (ETPs). Gensler stressed the importance of investor protection and adherence to securities laws, emphasizing the need for companies to offer transparent, honest, and comprehensive disclosures to the public. The high-profile debate between SEC Chair Gensler and CNBC's Joe Kernen on #Bitcoin 's status as sound money could mark an inflection point in the Bitcoin Overton window, potentially shaping its future mainstream acceptance. #MainstreamCycle  https://t.co/jqxyCfGZsj  pic.twitter.com/S0N7f0zG5M  — Mike (@fiatextractor) February 14, 2024   However, Joe Kernen challenged  Gensler’s cautious approach towards Bitcoin, suggesting that the SEC’s position appeared more hesitant than neutral. Kernen argued that Bitcoin’s widespread popularity and adoption among investors signify its legitimacy and value, far surpassing the label of a speculative asset. He asked: “I think it’s a little less than neutral, Mr. Chairman. I think it almost was, we called it grudgingly, when you finally got. From the court case, sort of forced in it. Is it really just neutral, or wasn’t there a little bit of a: we’re not sure about this thing, and buyer beware?” The CNBC interview delved into the contentious issues of fraud, manipulation, and the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies, alongside discussions on centralization in finance. SEC Chair Gary Gensler highlighted the inherent risks of cryptocurrency investments, underscoring the need for comprehensive regulatory measures to shield investors from fraudulent activities and market manipulation. In contrast, Joe Kernen emphasized that, compared to the global scale of illicit financial flows, cryptocurrencies account for only a minor fraction, with the US dollar dominating such transactions. In response to Kernen’s points, Gensler remarked that Bitcoin has become the “token of choice” for ransomware attacks, reflecting similar regulatory concerns surrounding the safety of digital currencies."
2024-04-11 14:24:00+00:00,Bitcoin Price Surged Amid Strong Job Markets Showcasing Monetary Policies Impact on BTC,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-price-surged-strong-job-markets-monetary-policies-impact-btc/,"Job markets in major economies like the US and UK showed some signs of strength in January. Meanwhile, February marked Bitcoin’s surge beyond the $50K barrier for the first time in two years. The unexpected uptick in US job market data sparked a wave of economic optimism, which could translate into bullish investor sentiment. However, this positive trend comes with its own set of challenges, including the potential for delayed rate cuts and the strengthening of sovereign currencies, which could complicate Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Rate cuts are generally seen as beneficial for tech stocks due to lower borrowing stimulus. Bitcoin also reacts positively due to the potential of investment interest due to the falling bond yield. After a period of sluggish price action, Bitcoin regained its $1 trillion market capitalization while holding above the crucial $50K mark. This resurgence is timely, aligning with market optimism as Bitcoin approaches its scheduled pre-halving run-up in April. Bitcoin is back to being a trillion dollar asset. pic.twitter.com/N4Fg7Yi8eX  — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) February 14, 2024   The market faces pressure from higher-than-expected consumer price index (CPI) inflation data. While the US and UK noted high core inflation in January, Bitcoin has shown resilience buoyed by the approval of the Bitcoin ETF. The US job market’s robust performance in January 2024 outpaced the previous year’s average monthly gains. This positive development was met with cautious optimism as it suggested potential delays in interest rate cuts. Now the high CPI numbers also point towards a strengthening dollar. The UK’s job market data further complicates the picture, showing pay growth at its weakest in over a year, yet not weak enough to prompt immediate action from the Bank of England. Investor sentiment is at its highest since January 2022 as per the Bank of America’s February Global Fund Manager Survey. The optimism is fueled by the economic outlook and the robust job market. However, there are challenges for Bitcoin due to the implications of delayed rate cuts and stronger national currencies. The introduction of Bitcoin ETF has set a positive tone for the crypto market, attracting significant inflows at the expense of Gold ETFs. According  to crypto analyst Tyler Durden, Gold products have seen substantial outflows, while Bitcoin ETFs have reached their record peak. Economists anticipate that the dollar will remain strong in February after it touched a three-month high on the back of inflation. A strengthening dollar and delayed rate cuts amid Bitcoin’s resilience and positive investor sentiments suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook for its future price movements. Bitcoin’s evolving economic scenario places it at the heart of a financial transformation, with broader parameters impacting its price."

 Recently, Bitcoin’s value soared to its highest  in more than two years, as it breached significant levels driven by steady investments into newly approved spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This uptick in Bitcoin’s price occurred alongside substantial investments into these spot ETFs, which recorded net inflows exceeding $1 billion in the last week and surpassed $2 billion  within just four days. The cryptocurrency experienced a 4.2% increase , reaching $51,924, marking its first ascent past the $51,000 threshold since December 2021. This surge brought Bitcoin within $18,000 of setting new all-time highs. Bitcoin’s valuation has soared past the $1 trillion mark, eclipsing Tesla’s market capitalization  and positioning itself among the ranks of global technology behemoths. The market capitalization of Bitcoin has once again surpassed $1 trillion, nearly double the market cap of Tesla. This milestone underscores the significant valuation and recognition of Bitcoin in the financial markets.

The cryptocurrency also saw a decrease in outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust following its recent approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to transition into a spot ETF. This transition facilitated the release of approximately $2 billion worth of Bitcoin into the market, initially triggering significant price declines for the digital currency. Recent data from Apollo , a Bitcoin tracking platform, reveals a significant surge in the cryptocurrency market. Over the past four days, the 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows of 43,300 Bitcoins, valued at $2.3 billion at the current market rate. We're witnessing total acceleration of #BTC  ETF inflows.

Highlighting the sector’s growth, four spot Bitcoin ETFs—excluding Grayscale—have now entered the “billionaire club.” Among these, the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF  reached this prestigious milestone on February 14, marking a notable achievement in the cryptocurrency investment landscape.

Data  from CoinShares indicates a net positive inflow into the new Bitcoin ETFs, projecting an optimistic future. Traditional financial giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton are exploring further innovations, including proposals for Ethereum ETFs. The Assets Under Management (AUM) of the newly launched U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF products have crossed the $10 billion  mark, with expectations for continued growth in AUM and net inflows.

Bernstein analysts have pointed out that a “fear of missing out” (FOMO) among retail investors is contributing to interest in Bitcoin, positioning the cryptocurrency on a trajectory towards setting new records, propelled by FOMO-induced purchases. Bernstein anticipates that investment in the new ETFs will exceed $10 billion in 2024. Market attention is also keenly focused on the expected Bitcoin halving event this year, projected to occur in April. This event will reduce the creation rate of new Bitcoins by half, an occurrence that has traditionally triggered a surge in the cryptocurrency’s value. The last halving in May 2020 led to a 50% increase in Bitcoin prices in its run-up. Enthusiasm for a potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF has also contributed to gains across the broader cryptocurrency market, with Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, increasing by 2.41%  to reach a years’ peak of $2,788. U.S.-listed cryptocurrency stocks experienced notable gains, with Coinbase Global Inc  up byover 14% in positive earning results expectations, Marathon Digital Holdings  Inc  jumping 14.4%, and MicroStrategy Inc,  the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, climbing 12.2%.

This is reflected in the spot trading volumes for Bitcoin , which remain significantly below their peaks in 2021 and 2017. The reduced trading volumes have also contributed to the swift rise of Bitcoin throughout 2023, benefiting from the lack of active sellers in the market. Currently, the SEC and Coinbase are involved in a legal dispute that could redefine the classification and regulatory framework of cryptocurrency tokens."

Key Takeaways
 During Wednesday’s European morning hours, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $51,000 , reaching a market capitalization of $1 trillion  for the first time since December 2021, according to data. The increase was fueled by optimistic expectations for the sustained growth of Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, with options traders speculating that prices could soar to as much as $75,000  in the upcoming months. The circulating supply  of Bitcoin has reached 19,627,443 BTC, constituting 93.46% of its maximum supply limit of 21 million coins. This milestone highlights the growing scarcity of digital assets as they edge closer to their supply cap. This trend is buoyed by increasing positive investor sentiment , driven by factors such as the ongoing bull market and the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, which are having a broad impact on the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The surge in Bitcoin investment from both retail and institutional investors has contributed to a steady rise in Bitcoin’s price, underscoring its sustained value appreciation in the market. Bitcoin previously achieved a $1 trillion market cap milestone in November 2021 amidst a significant bull run that propelled BTC to a temporary all-time high of $69,000 . This period of intense growth was not limited to Bitcoin alone but was also reflected across the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, culminating in a landmark combined market capitalization of $3 trillion for the first time in the industry’s history. The forthcoming Bitcoin halving event is projected to be a major catalyst in elevating the market price of Bitcoin. An analysis by Grayscale  suggests that Bitcoin ETFs have the potential to fundamentally alter the demand-supply dynamics of the cryptocurrency, effectively mitigating the selling pressure typically associated with halving events. According to data from Coinglass , there has been a substantial $53 million in liquidations, mainly from short positions, in the past hour alone. This figure escalates dramatically over the last 24 hours, with more than $217 million worth of liquidations recorded, highlighting the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. According to Grayscale’s analysis , with the current mining rate set at 6.25 Bitcoin per block, the annual output translates to an approximate value of $14 billion, assuming a Bitcoin price of $43,000. This indicates that to sustain the existing market prices, a buy pressure equivalent to $14 billion is necessary within the same timeframe. The report says :  “Post-halving, these requirements will decrease by half: with only 3.125 Bitcoin mined per block, that equates to a decrease to $7 billion annually, effectively easing the sell pressure.” The price of Bitcoin significantly influences the operational expenses of miners. The anticipated halving event will decrease the mining reward to 3.125 BTC, necessitating a sustained high market value of Bitcoin to ensure that mining remains an economically feasible activity. A key driver behind Bitcoin’s recent upward trajectory has been the consistent influx of aforementioned positive developments from spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have been on the market for a full month. U.S. BTC ETFs currently hold 704,339 BTC after seeing net inflows of 85,119 BTC since January 10. Another massive day yesterday, the largest net inflow to date of 12,806 BTC – pushing BlackRock's BTC exposure above 100,000 BTC. Huge! pic.twitter.com/s1dQP41COd  — Vetle Lunde (@VetleLunde) February 14, 2024   The remarkable success of new spot Bitcoin ETFs is underscored by their rapid accumulation of over $3 billion in net flows within just a month, a milestone that took the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) nearly two years to achieve. This comparison, highlighted by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas, emphasizes  the significant investor interest in Bitcoin ETFs. On Tuesday alone, the ETFs experienced their largest single day of net inflows, propelling BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to hold 100,000 BTC.

Key Takeaways
 In January, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, Cathie Wood anticipates  that the SEC will not extend its approval to spot exchange-traded funds that hold cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ether. Speaking at the WSJ’s Take On the Week podcast , the founder of ARK Investment Management said: “We’d be surprised to see anything but Bitcoin and Ether being approved by the SEC,” In an upcoming episode, the full context of Cathie Wood‘s statement will be revealed, but recent reports suggest that cryptocurrencies deemed as securities may face challenges in gaining approval for corresponding ETFs. SEC Chair Gary Gensler is well-known for his previous description of Bitcoin (BTC) as a commodity, while his stance on Ethereum (ETH) continues to be less clear. ❖ Cathie Wood isn't expecting the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve spot exchange-traded funds holding cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin and ether. ""We'd be surprised to see anything but bitcoin and ether being approved by the SEC,"" Wood, founder of ARK Investment… — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) February 12, 2024   The classification of Ethereum as a commodity has also been supported by others, including Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chair Rostin Benham, who expressed this viewpoint during a Senate Agriculture Hearing in March 2023. While this classification does not ensure that the SEC won’t consider ETH a security, it suggests a potential for Bitcoin and Ethereum to receive similar regulatory treatment. Gary Gensler has further clarified that the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs is specific to Bitcoin and does not indicate a broader acceptance of other digital assets. This statement underscores the SEC’s cautious approach to expanding ETF approvals beyond Bitcoin and Ether. In a significant move within the cryptocurrency investment space, Ark, in collaboration with 21Shares, received approval in January to launch the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), marking a milestone for firms venturing into spot cryptocurrency ETFs. Expanding their product lineup, Ark and 21Shares have introduced four ETFs focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum futures strategies, known as ARKA, ARKC, ARKY, and ARKZ. This diversification reflects the growing interest and varying investment strategies within the digital asset market. Our base case for #Bitcoin  is in the $600K range, and our bull case is $1.5 million by 2030.– Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest pic.twitter.com/VHanVnHehq  — Vivek⚡️ (@Vivek4real_) February 5, 2024   The battle for regulatory approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. is reaching a crucial turning point. Ark Invest, known for its innovative investment strategies, is actively vying for SEC approval of its spot Ethereum ETF proposal, with a decision expected in May. It’s not alone – VanEck has a similar proposal under review by the SEC, making this a potentially landmark moment for cryptocurrency investment access. If an Ethereum spot ETF gains approval, it could trigger a surge in institutional and mainstream investor capital into the market, further solidifying cryptocurrency’s legitimacy as an asset class. The SEC’s past rejection of spot proposals has fueled the rise of crypto futures ETFs, but these come with additional complexities and may not be ideal for all investors. The ongoing discussion around XRP ETFs adds another layer of intrigue. The absence of such funds in the U.S., coupled with the SEC’s ongoing legal battle with Ripple Labs, paints an uncertain picture for XRP’s regulatory future. However, the success of 21Shares’ XRP ETP in Switzerland signifies that there’s global demand for regulated investment vehicles tied to a wider range of cryptocurrencies."

Key Takeaways
 In the first week of Craig Wright’s latest court case, the self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto argued that evidence presented by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) was misconstrued as forgery, and could be explained in other ways. During the second week of the hearing, the focus has moved on to some of the earliest Bitcoin transactions initiated by the cryptocurrency’s inventor. When questioned, however, Wright failed to recollect the details of early Satoshi payments he claims to have sent. In recent days, questions posed by COPA lawyer Jonathon Hough have followed a simple line of reasoning. Namely, if Craig Wright really is Satoshi Nakamoto, he would be able to remember who received BTC from Satoshi’s wallet. 1/ As the cross-examination of Craig Wright has progressed, COPA has shown the Court numerous forged documents which Wright has relied on to prove his claim to be Satoshi. Faced with fonts that post-date the alleged dates of documents and a host of other anachronisms, Wright… — COPA (@opencryptoorg) February 8, 2024   “You said you transferred to hundreds of people,” Hough prompted at one point on Tuesday, February 7. “I don’t remember all of them now,” Wright responded. At this, Judge James Mellor interrupted to express mild disbelief. Attempting to explain his forgetfulness, Wright responded “it had no value at the time, my Lord. Most were pseudonymous.”  As well as exposing Wright’s lack of knowledge about activity originating from Bitcoin wallets that are known to have belonged to Satoshi Nakamoto, Hough also cast doubt on alleged transactions the computer scientist does claim to remember. During Tuesday’s cross-examination, Hough raised the issue of transactions Wright claims he sent to the ZCash inventor Zooko Wilcox. But “In reality, Satoshi never transferred to Zooko,” the COPA lawyer alleged. C: [recording continues. Feck off. Show me now or fecking walk.] I'm not going to ask about the language you used. You said you had only transferred to Finney and Zooko.W: No. What most people call Satoshi's Bitcoins were owned by [his companies].C: Satoshi, as well as… — Norbert ⚡️ (@bitnorbert) February 13, 2024   Wright then reasserted his claim, to which Hough responded: “So he’s wrong when he says he never received from Satoshi?” For his part, Wilkox will testify in court this week as one of COPA’s witnesses. But his antagonistic relationship with Wright goes back years. In the past, Wilkox has made no secret of the fact that he thinks Craig Wright is “scammer scum” who has created “bogus evidence” to support his claim. Zooko is a Communist. his idea of decentralisation is no corporations and everybody lives in a Marxist dream. ask Stalin how that was — Dr Craig S Wright (@Dr_CSWright) January 15, 2023   In 2017, for example, he wrote  that “Craig Wright doesn’t understand [cryptographic] domains well enough to design anything like Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, Wright has called Zooko a “communist,” and the 2 men have often clashed over ideological matters, with Wilcox’s brand of cypherpunk libertarianism at odds with Wright’s more corporate, legalistic approach."

Key Takeaways
 Analysts at Bernstein have made a Bitcoin forecast  that suggests the digital currency is poised for an unparalleled surge. Bernstein analysts contend that a mix of influences, such as the introduction of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and an increasing sense of fear of missing out (FOMO) among investors, has the potential to drive the cryptocurrency to new records. Bernstein’s analysis centers on several key factors that could unleash Bitcoin’s potential. Chief among these is the recent introduction of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs provide traditional investors with exposure to Bitcoin without requiring them to navigate the complexities often associated with direct cryptocurrency purchases. The result, according to the analysts, could be a dramatic influx of institutional investment, bolstering demand and driving prices significantly higher. ❖ Prepare for a Bitcoin FOMO rally to record highs: Bernstein On Friday, Bitcoin crossed the $48,000 mark, registering a 13% increase over the past week and edging closer to the key $50,000 resistance level. Despite a significant upturn in 2023, with a 160% increase, and… — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) February 12, 2024   The analysts also draw attention to the growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin. Major corporations are increasingly adding Bitcoin to their portfolios, and countries like El Salvador are now accepting the cryptocurrency as legal tender. This legitimization of Bitcoin on a global scale could fuel mainstream adoption, resulting in a potential explosion in investor demand and catapulting Bitcoin towards new all-time highs. Even with the considerable advancements Bitcoin has achieved, the present level of enthusiasm hasn’t exceeded the intense highs seen during the memorable bull markets  of 2017 and 2021. Nonetheless, Chhugani and Sapra contend  that the scene is swiftly evolving, emphasizing  that the emergence of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is crucial in molding the cryptocurrency’s trajectory. Analysts have identified the launch of Bitcoin ETFs as a significant force propelling Bitcoin’s price higher. They noted a sharp reduction in outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, now down to around $50 million. Meanwhile, new ETFs have experienced a surge, with nearly $1 billion flowing in during just the last two trading sessions. This trend marks a shift towards greater acceptance of Bitcoin as a conventional investment option, amplified by investors’ fear of missing out (FOMO). In the wake of growing optimism, the fortitude of Bitcoin investors, colloquially known as “diamond hands ,” has become more evident. These investors have maintained their stakes through the cryptocurrency market’s ups and downs, showcasing a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. #Bitcoin  ETFs ‘deemed a success’ by key measures one month after debut.

This enduring patience and belief in Bitcoin’s value are not only admirable but also signal a positive outlook for the market’s future trajectory. Bernstein’s forecast of a rally for Bitcoin following its halving event has gained additional support from the successful debut and sustained inflows into ETFs. The analysts believe that these occurrences are more than mere temporary fluctuations; they signify a deeper transformation within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Bitcoin’s recent surge past the $50,000 mark  has sparked renewed interest in the cryptocurrency, making its recent achievement all the more remarkable. This milestone comes amidst an all-time low in public interest, at least as gauged by Google search volumes. The contrasting trends – strong financial performance alongside waning public curiosity – suggest a maturing market  for Bitcoin. Analysts are closely watching this divergence, exploring its potential implications as the cryptocurrency may be leaving behind its earlier era of speculation-driven price swings and entering a new phase of valuation. Yassine Elmandjra of ARK Invest took to X to highlight  an intriguing trend contrasting Bitcoin’s recent price achievements with its search volume metrics. Traditionally, Google search spikes for Bitcoin have paralleled its price surges, notably during the bull markets of late 2017 and early 2021. Despite an upward movement in Bitcoin’s price, the search volume has remained notably low. This suggests that the ongoing price rally might not be driven by the usual retail excitement or widespread speculative interest that characterized past cycles. Bitcoin hit $50k.

Key Takeaways
 In the second week of a courtroom showdown between Dr. Craig Wright and the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), Dr. Wright is sticking by his claim that he invented Bitcoin under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Taking place in a London business court that rarely attracts much public attention, the hearing is being overseen by Judge James Mellor, who not only has to deal with Wright’s courtroom dramatics but also misbehavior from the viewing public. Throughout Wright’s cross-examination, COPA’s lawyer Jonathan Hough combed through the various pieces of evidence Wright has presented over the years to support his claim.  In each instance, Hough cast serious doubts on the authenticity of the documents, highlighting anomalous timestamps and formatting inconsistencies that contradict Wright’s version of events.  The detailed interrogation is part of COPA’s strategy to prove Wright forged evidence. And according to many observers, the strategy is working. Where Hough poked holes in Wright’s defense, the Australian computer scientist blamed his staff, hackers and various software programs for the documentary inconsistencies. C: So we take it from you that the harddrive didn't have a private key for the genesis block.W: It did not.C: There was no [missed]W: No, I can show you how to do it.

Pressed whether he could provide cryptographic proof of his claim, for example, by demonstrating ownership of one of Satoshi’s private Bitcoin or PGP keys, Wright claimed he lost the hard drive on which they were stored. Although the evidence Wright has presented to back up his claim looks increasingly weak, COPA’s attempts to undermine Wright’s credibility go even further.  Extending beyond evidence directly related to his Satroshi claim, Hough has sought to paint a picture of Wright as a career liar and serial plagiarizer – the kind of man who wouldn’t think twice about taking credit for someone else’s work and faking evidence to make his story seem more likely.  A collection of Wright moments from my notes today: 🧵 Wright thinks copying entire blocks of text without making it clear they're quotes is fine for his academic work, though acknowledges missing a footnote or two and blames his software for that. Judge chimes in in disbelief. — WizSec Bitcoin Research (@wizsecurity) February 13, 2024   For his part, even Judge Mellor has at times expressed disbelief at some of Wright’s more outlandish claims and has repeatedly chastised him for rejecting the authority of expert witnesses without good reason. Yet, as his defense has unraveled, Wright has remained steadfastly committed to his story. “But I am Satoshi!” he desperately proclaimed at one point. As well as presiding over Wright’s increasingly frantic performance on the witness stand, Judge Mellor has also had to deal with threats to the privacy of his courtroom. After a photograph of evidence presented during the case was circulated online, a live stream of the hearing has been shut down to prevent further leaks. The leaked evidence in question was a photograph of Magnus Granath, more commonly known as the crypto influencer Hodlonaught. The two men have been publicly feuding since 2019 when Hodlonaught posted a series of tweets calling Wright a “fraud” and a “scammer” and labeling him “Faketoshi”. In response, Wright demanded Granath delete the tweets and acknowledge him as Satoshi. When Hodlonaught didn’t comply, Wright offered a bounty on his identity, doxxed him, and sued him for defamation in the UK.   Like Wright vs COPA, that trial considered whether there was sufficient evidence in support of Wright’s claim for him to sue someone for denying it. Judge Robert Jay ultimately ruled that there wasn’t and Wright’s suit was dismissed.  It’s so satisfying seeing Craig’s web of lies from the Norwegian trial against me catch up with him here in UK.

Key Takeaways
 Spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced a rapid surge, surpassing the creation of new Bitcoin by miners by more than ten times in recent trading sessions. Based on initial data , approximately $493.4 million, equivalent to about 10,280 Bitcoin, was invested in spot Bitcoin ETFs up to February 12. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust dominated the inflow of funds, receiving a substantial $374.7 million. In comparison, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund attracted $151.9 million, and the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF garnered $40 million. However, these inflows were slightly balanced out by outflows of $95 million from Grayscale and $20.8 million from the Invesco Galaxy ETF, though the net inflows still approached nearly half a billion dollars. On Monday, February 12, Bitcoin miners generated  approximately 1,059 BTC, valued at around $51 million, based on data from Blockchain.com. This production represents just 10% of the amount of BTC absorbed by spot ETFs. On February 9, a comparable trend was observed, with about 12,700 BTC or $541.5 million worth of the asset collectively flowing into ETFs, in contrast to the 980 BTC worth approximately $45 million that was added to the market through mining. BlackRock spearheaded the inflows with a significant $250.7 million, followed closely by Fidelity with $188.4 million. Ark 21Shares also experienced substantial inflows, amassing $136.5 million. In contrast, Grayscale saw its outflows decrease to the week’s lowest level at $51.8 million, contributing to a remarkable day of overall net inflows. In related news, Bitcoin advocate Anthony Pompliano remarked , “Wall Street loves Bitcoin,” during a CNBC’s Squawk Box interview on February 12. He said : “There is 12.5x more demand for Bitcoin than what is being produced on a daily basis.” Pompliano further noted  that approximately 80% of Bitcoin’s total supply has remained stationary for the past six months. He elaborated that only about $200 billion worth of BTC is available for trading, highlighting the significant impact of these ETFs, which have absorbed 5% of the entire tradable supply of Bitcoin in just 30 days. Wall Street LOVES bitcoin. They are buying up 12.5x more bitcoin per day than the network can produce.  The march to a new all-time high is underway if this continues.

This figure surpassed that of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which saw a volume of $296.5 million, according to Seyffart. Big volume day for $IBIT .

Despite this milestone, Seyffart remarked  that reaching the $1 billion mark “isn’t that big of a deal” for Bitcoin ETFs. He noted that while it represented an increase from recent days, it was still well below the trading volumes seen in the first couple of weeks after their introduction."

 The growing popularity of cryptocurrency investment is forcing traditional finance to consider new financial avenues. Digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ether are continuing to attract considerable interest from investors, mainly because of their potential for significant profits and their ability to serve as a hedge against the volatility of conventional financial markets. This interest is driven by several factors. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies offers enhanced security and autonomy beyond the reach of traditional banking systems. Moreover, the widespread adoption of blockchain technology across various sectors underscores the transformative impact of cryptocurrencies on financial dealings and payment methodologies. The allure of swift financial gains in the crypto market has captivated both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. However, the inherent risks and volatility demand prudent investment strategies and a thorough understanding of the market dynamics before diving in. Investing in Bitcoin directly entails buying and holding the cryptocurrency through an exchange, subjecting investors to the direct impact of BTC price movements. Indirect investment routes like mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or futures contracts offer exposure to the crypto market without owning the digital currency itself. These options involve investing in crypto derivatives or a collection of cryptocurrencies, providing a diversified and often regulated investment approach. Investing in Bitcoin ETFs presents several key advantages for those looking to gain cryptocurrency exposure without direct ownership. The primary benefits include: Bitcoin ETFs offer an easier entry point into cryptocurrency investments, allowing individuals to use their existing brokerage accounts. This approach is particularly advantageous for those less familiar with cryptocurrency trading platforms. It means that someone with a background in traditional stock trading can diversify into Bitcoin ETFs without needing to understand the technical aspects of cryptocurrencies, such as managing private keys or digital wallets. Bitget Research Chief Analyst Ryan Lee explained to CCN readers that investing in ETFs can feel more convenient compared to opening a separate account for buying Bitcoin on platforms like Coinbase.  “Investors can hold Bitcoin ETFs through traditional brokerage accounts, managing Bitcoin and other assets in the same account.” He added: “Investors don’t have to worry about losing or having their passwords stolen for cryptocurrency exchange accounts, reducing the risk of potential asset loss.” Bitcoin ETFs benefit from operating in regulated financial environments, which bolsters investor safety. The regulatory framework ensures transparency and compliance, providing a more secure investment landscape. The SEC’s approval of the first U.S. Bitcoin futures ETF in 2021 and the later approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 highlight significant strides toward incorporating digital currencies into the mainstream financial system. Offering access to a novel asset class, Bitcoin ETFs enable investors to diversify their portfolios effectively. Since Bitcoin’s performance often diverges from traditional assets like stocks and bonds, incorporating a Bitcoin ETF can distribute risk more evenly. This diversification can be particularly valuable during periods when traditional markets are struggling, offering a potential buffer against broader market dips. Compared to direct cryptocurrency holdings, ETFs generally provide higher liquidity, facilitating the easy buying and selling of shares at prevailing market prices during trading hours. This aspect is essential for promptly responding to market movements, an important consideration in the fast-paced crypto market. Timing of options approval on spot bitcoin ETFs becoming more important… Liquidity leader in ETF category has historically been able to charge higher fees. Part of becoming/remaining liquidity leader involves having robust derivatives ecosystem develop around underlying ETF. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) February 6, 2024   Bitcoin ETFs may also lead to more favorable tax situations compared to directly holding Bitcoin. Many jurisdictions offer ETFs advantageous tax treatments, such as delaying capital gains taxes until the sale of the investment, in contrast to the immediate tax implications of certain transactions in direct Bitcoin investments. According to Lee, Bitcoin ETFs can also be held in investors’ retirement accounts, avoiding capital gains tax associated with directly holding Bitcoin. However, this also means that even if the Bitcoin price falls, the tax generated in the retirement account won’t decrease. While Bitcoin ETFs present appealing advantages for investors seeking cryptocurrency exposure, there are notable disadvantages to consider. The main drawbacks include: A significant downside to Bitcoin ETFs is their exposure to the cryptocurrency market’s high volatility. Bitcoin and its related ETFs can undergo rapid and substantial price swings within very short periods. For instance, daily price shifts of more than 10% are not uncommon for Bitcoin, which can be unsettling for investors unaccustomed to such levels of volatility. Investing in Bitcoin ETFs also means facing the cryptocurrency market’s inherent security and regulatory challenges. As a relatively new and evolving market, cryptocurrency faces ongoing regulatory uncertainties and compliance hurdles across various jurisdictions, in addition to being prone to security risks like hacking incidents. Notably, regulatory actions in significant markets, such as China, have previously led to sharp declines in market values. Hot take on the ETF situation:  Most people who want to own BTC today already do. Most people that want to have ""financial exposure"" to BTC today don't. But the latter market doesn't know how to activate itself directly. They are risk averse and require a lot of advice.… — Jack O'Holleran (@jackoholleran) January 11, 2024   Bitcoin ETFs typically incur higher fees than traditional ETFs, attributed to the costs associated with maintaining and securing the underlying cryptocurrency assets. Credit: CNBC Bitcoin ETF investors do not hold Bitcoin directly; they invest in a fund that owns Bitcoin on their behalf. This indirect ownership means missing out on certain benefits of direct Bitcoin possession, such as using it for transactions or personal custody without intermediaries. There can be discrepancies between a Bitcoin ETF’s performance and actual Bitcoin market movements, known as tracking error . This divergence can result from various factors, including fund expenses, the methods used to achieve Bitcoin exposure (like futures contracts), and the timing of market trades versus fund rebalancing. For example, a futures-based Bitcoin ETF may not accurately mirror real-time Bitcoin price movements, especially in turbulent markets. Tracking error essentially gauges the deviation between the performance of a fund or portfolio and its benchmark index, reflecting the fund manager’s success in mirroring the index’s returns. According to Bitget Research Chief Analyst Ryan Lee, one primary benefit Bitcoin ETFs offer relates to the anticipated halving events of Bitcoin itself. The halving mechanism inherently restricts the pace at which new Bitcoins are created, acting as a bulwark against inflation and contributing to potential price appreciation. Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has experienced three such halving occurrences, each leading to notable surges in its price. The next, or fourth, halving event is slated for April 2024, drawing considerable attention from investors.

Lee explained: “With the exponential growth of Ordinals users, numerous new and existing protocols on the Bitcoin blockchain have emerged, driving strong development of the Bitcoin ecosystem.” Furthermore, the rise of Bitcoin’s layer 2 solutions has considerably expanded the ecosystem’s capabilities. Jademont, the founder of Waterdrip Capital, has highlighted  the future expansion of this infrastructure, predicting the launch of at least 10 Bitcoin layer 2 networks in the coming year. This advancement is set to enhance the Bitcoin ecosystem’s efficiency, particularly in handling transactions."

Key Takeaways
 In the coming days, East Asia will commence celebrations for the Year of the Dragon , regarded as one of the most auspicious and prosperous signs in the Chinese Zodiac. As East Asia welcomes its grandest festival of the year, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization hit a one-month peak , coinciding with the onset of  one of the most important times of the Chinese Zodiac. The Mandarin Chinese term for dragon, which in English sounds akin to “long,” has spurred interest among cryptocurrency traders. According to a recent analysis  by 10X Research, Bitcoin’s price is projected to climb as high as $48,000 in the days ahead, leveraging the historical pattern of gains observed around the Chinese New Year.

Over the last two weeks, Bitcoin has witnessed nearly a 15% increase, mitigating previous losses amidst the hype around anticipated Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which eventually led to a “sell-the-news” scenario. This uptick, marking Bitcoin’s peak  since January 12, coincides with record-setting performances by the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 indices. Bitcoin’s recent surge to a one-month high represents a significant milestone, marking the end of a correction phase  where the digital currency had dipped to $38,500 towards the end of January. Thielen employs  the Elliott Wave theory , a method of technical analysis that predicts future price movements through the identification of recurring wave patterns. He observes that Bitcoin has concluded its fourth wave retracement at $38,500 and is embarking on the fifth impulsive phase of its bullish trajectory. Thielen’s projection sees the cryptocurrency escalating to $52,000 by mid-March, suggesting a strong upward momentum in the weeks ahead. Thielen also projects  that the bullish trend for Bitcoin will extend into 2025, with the peak of this upward movement expected to occur between April and September of that year. In recent weeks, various Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have successfully absorbed over a billion dollars in Bitcoin selling pressure, showcasing significant demand for the cryptocurrency. The on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant  observed in a Thursday report that the flow of Bitcoin from miner wallets—a sign of selling activity—has decelerated. According to Bloomberg, data compiled by CryptoQuant shows that since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin miner reserves (the unsold Bitcoins held in digital wallets associated with the company) have decreased by 8,400, down to 1.8 million.https://t.co/rHvcaXO19B  — OKX Ventures (@OKX_Ventures) February 7, 2024   Recent analysis highlights Bitcoin’s recovery  above a crucial threshold, marking the first ascent since the retracement that followed the ‘ETF hangover’ beginning on January 12th. Additionally, traders have noted that the recent behavior of Bitcoin’s price has alleviated concerns of an impending sell-off, pointing to the currency’s strong performance in weekly trends as a sign of market resilience. China’s Lunar New Year, which occurs on varying dates each year, signals the start of a week-long national holiday, commonly referred to as “Golden Week.” Historically, this time frame has been associated with increased volatility and reduced trading volumes in the cryptocurrency market. In 2024, Golden Week is scheduled from February 10th to February 17th. The following table outlines the behavior of Bitcoin’s price  during past Chinese New Year Weeks: The recent rally in Bitcoin’s price is associated with a surge in holdings among wallets with 1,000 or more BTC, which have seen their highest level of accumulation in over 14 months, signaling a resurgence in investor confidence. Additionally, there’s an uptick in Bitcoin’s social volume , indicating growing interest and discussion around the asset. 📈 #Crypto  markets are recovering well after the post-#ETF  drop 4 weeks ago. #Bitcoin , in particular, has completed its comeback, reaching $46.3K for the first time since January 11th. $BTC  social volume is rising, while the crowd shows less interest in $ETH , $DOGE , and $XMR . pic.twitter.com/rcaxdBwCfX  — Santiment (@santimentfeed) February 9, 2024   Despite Bitcoin’s recovery and its sustained dominance in the cryptocurrency market, on-chain data points to ongoing skepticism among traders toward Bitcoin for the third week in a row. A particularly striking observation is the ratio of Bitcoin held on exchanges, which has dropped to its lowest since December 2017. This trend suggests that investors are inclined to hold onto their tokens, anticipating future gains rather than selling in the current market."

Key Takeaways
 Argentina’s libertarian president, Javier Milei, has dismissed  the idea of implementing his dollarization plan in 2024. In a discussion with local media, Milei explained  that although achieving dollarization and the free convertibility of currency remains the ultimate objective of his government, the timeframe to stabilize the nation’s economy and roll out such a plan within this year is unfeasible. Argentine President Javier Milei is pacing the implementation of his libertarian reforms, with the prominent pledge of shutting down the Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) and phasing out its fiat currency being postponed until at least next year. Argentina News: Javier Milei ruled out dollarizing the Argentine economy in 2024: “Time is tight” ""Dollarization is the final step of an entire process that begins with the cleaning up of the Central Bank,"" he said. In an interview, the president said that ""there is no time""… pic.twitter.com/WSY1nlntug  — DutchLibertarian (@LibertarianDuty) February 6, 2024   In a recent interview with local media, Milei indicated the challenges of timing, noting the extensive process required to restructure the financial system. He elaborated:  “There is no time. Think that if we maintained the current pace of sanitation of the BCRA, it would only be clean at the end of June. Adapting the financial system model can take up to a year.” Despite these delays, Milei remains committed to the reform path, emphasizing that the Argentine economy’s relatively modest monetary base could facilitate the transition to dollarization and the discontinuation of the Argentine peso. He cited  ongoing evaluations indicating that Argentina’s dollar reserves could potentially support the nation’s move towards dollarization, underscoring his administration’s dedication to these long-term economic strategies. Milei explained  that the transition away from the Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) could be facilitated using dollars, but highlighted that the U.S. dollar might not be the definitive choice for Argentina’s future currency. He proposed a more flexible approach, suggesting that various sectors of the economy could adopt different currencies based on their unique needs.

Follow for more Milei content in English. pic.twitter.com/1tqInIftwf  — freethinkster (@freethinkster) August 18, 2023   He said : “Dollarization is the final step of an entire process that begins with the sanitation of the BCRA, to then advance in the reform of the financial system and then in the end it is liquidated. That reform is to create an anti-run bank, and once that anti-run reform is done, you can move on to a free banking system. You can pay the BCRA in any currency, although the simplest thing is to do it in dollars. However, this does not mean that individuals use the dollar as currency. For example, a tanker is likely to use WTI; someone from gas will use BTU; in the field, Chicago Soybeans. The result is a currency basket where the weights are freely determined by individuals, which neutralizes you from the effects of the monetary policy of a particular country.” Milei mentioned  that the topic of dollarization has yet to be broached with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), despite the organization recently greenlighting a disbursement of $4.7 billion to Argentina as part of a renegotiated repayment schedule for the nation’s $44 billion debt. Even in the absence of explicit policy changes, Argentina’s new leadership under Javier Milei could significantly influence the country’s approach to cryptocurrency usage. 🔥 LAST 🔥 🇦🇷 Milei strategically ELIMINATES the taxes of #Bitcoin   and #criptomonedas  from the ""Omnibus Law"" reform, seeking rapid approval.

This stance has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift at the geopolitical level, altering how developing nations view and engage with digital currencies. Ultimately, the optimal remedy for Argentina’s economic challenges remains uncertain. Both dollarization and the adoption of cryptocurrencies have their advocates and critics. Time alone will reveal the effectiveness of Javier Milei’s strategies, as history will be the ultimate judge of his tenure’s success or failure."

Key Takeaways
 On the 4th day of Craig Wright vs. the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), Dr. Wright sat down for his 3rd day of cross-examination, as COPA’s lawyer Jonathan Hough continued his attempt to discredit evidence Wright claims proves he is Satoshi Nakamoto. Individually, the inconsistencies in document formatting and timestamping flagged by Hough might not be enough to support COPA’s accusations of forgery. But piece by piece, the organization is building a detailed and expansive case.  Time after time this week, Hough flagged documents that Wright had previously presented as evidence that he invented Bitcoin. In each case. The COPA lawyer has pointed to inconsistencies that suggest Wright may have lied about when he created the files. From the use of file formats that didn’t exist at the time, to reams of metadata that contradict the stories he has told about their inception, Hough picked through evidence the Australian computer scientist has presented in support of his claim with a fine comb. In most cases, Wright’s defense was that the files in question have been reformated over the years. Over the course of 3 days, he has blamed various software systems, employees who allegedly planted fake documents, hackers, and his own lawyers for the anomalies identified by COPA.  1/ As the cross-examination of Craig Wright has progressed, COPA has shown the Court numerous forged documents which Wright has relied on to prove his claim to be Satoshi.

When pressed on the reliability of evidence he presented in a previous legal battle with the Tulip Trust, Wright declared “I have no idea and I cannot actually vouch for anything being completely real”. Given the technical nature of much of the evidence being considered in Wright vs. Copa, the court has relied on a number of expert witnesses.   Time and again during his cross-examination, Wright called into doubt expert opinions presented as evidence, including those of his legal team.

One of the advantages of having independent expert witnesses is, if the court agrees that they have given an objective, suitably supported opinion, the court can rely on their opinions.” “So I suggest that you focus on their opinions, he added. “Because at the moment, unless they are completely undermined, it’s likely I’m going to rely on them, okay?”."

Key Takeaways
 Back in 2017, former US President Barack Obama sparked debate when he compared Bitcoin to “having a Swiss bank in everyone’s pocket”. New comments have shone fresh perspective the former President’s comments, claiming that this analogy effectively highlights the appeal and revolutionary impact of Bitcoin on the financial sector. In a recent discussion, Gabor Gurbacs, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency industry and an advisor for VanEck ETF and Tether, brought a new perspective  to former U.S. President Barack Obama’s comments on Bitcoin. Obama’s analogy  of Bitcoin being akin to “everyone walking around with a Swiss bank in their pocket” was intended to highlight concerns from a governmental standpoint about the potential for financial privacy to enable tax evasion and other illicit activities. This comparison suggests apprehension about the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and its ability to operate outside traditional financial oversight, potentially undermining the regulatory frameworks established by governments worldwide. Obama said : “The question we now have to ask is, if, technologically, it is possible to make an impenetrable device for a system where the encryption is so strong that there is no key. There’s no door at all. What mechanisms do we have available to even do simpkle things as tax enforcement? Because, if you, in fact, can’t crack that at all, government can’t get in, then everybody is walking around with the Swiss bank account in their pockets.” Former U.S. President is saying that #Bitcoin  is like “everyone walking around with a Swiss bank in their pocket.” He said that in a concerning context… but it’s exactly the point of Bitcoin and this is perfectly illustrated. Game on! pic.twitter.com/NaBMhc6X3B  — Gabor Gurbacs (@gaborgurbacs) February 7, 2024   Gurbacs interprets Obama’s analogy from a positive angle, underscoring the empowerment and financial autonomy that Bitcoin offers to individuals. From his viewpoint, the ability to “have a Swiss bank in your pocket” symbolizes the democratization of finance, where people worldwide can access and control their wealth without intermediary oversight or geographical restrictions. This perspective aligns with the increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin, as evidenced by the growing interest in Bitcoin ETFs, which aim to provide investors with regulated and mainstream avenues to invest in cryptocurrency. Gurbacs’ stance highlights a fundamental debate between the traditional financial system’s need for regulation and the cryptocurrency ethos of decentralization and individual sovereignty, especially as Bitcoin continues to gain institutional acceptance. Obama wasn’t the only figure from his party to openly speak about cryptocurrencies. Jim Messina, Obama’s former White House Deputy Chief of Staff and CEO of Messina Group,shared  his confidence in Bitcoin’s potential by stating he was willing to wager his Porsche on Bitcoin’s price rebounding to $60,000. President Obama’s former deputy Chief of Staff and campaign manager Jim Messina says, “I’m incredibly bullish on #bitcoin ” “I’m buying #bitcoin  right now. I will bet you my Porsche #bitcoin  gets back to $60,000.” pic.twitter.com/x4jU5Xa3QL  — Documenting ₿itcoin 📄 (@DocumentingBTC) February 6, 2024   In an interview with Fox Business back in 2022, Messina highlighted  cryptocurrency as one of the most thrilling advancements of the current generation. Despite Bitcoin’s value dropping over 60% within the year, Messina maintained his optimistic stance, actively purchasing more Bitcoin and expressing his belief in its recovery to $60,000 from its then-position at $20,000. He emphasized  the importance of eliminating “BS projects” for Bitcoin to truly stand out in the cryptocurrency space. Despite Bitcoin’s groundbreaking potential, it encounters skepticism and regulatory hurdles, with concerns over its use in illicit activities, volatility, and environmental toll prompting demands for tighter control. Nonetheless, Bitcoin’s proponents highlight its transparency and pseudonymous nature as safeguards against misuse, arguing for its advantages over cash or conventional banking. As Bitcoin continues to challenge the status quo, its influence on how money is viewed and used is undeniable, signaling a significant shift in the financial domain that is set to persist."

Remarkably, during this period, GBTC underwent a significant reduction, liquidating around 150,000 BTC. However, the introduction of FBTC and IBIT has nearly offset this outflow, collectively absorbing almost 140,000 BTC. Additionally, the market saw the entrance of two more Bitcoin ETFs, ARKB by Ark Invest and BITB by Bitwise, which together accounted for another 31,000 BTC acquisitions.

Key Takeaways
 Day 3 of Craig Wright vs. the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) saw Wright continue to deny the allegations that he deliberately altered evidence to make it seem as if he was the Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. Continuing a trend established the day before, on Wednesday, February 8, COPA’s lawyer Jonathan Hough interrogated Wright over the veracity of a string of documents the organization alleges were doctored. When faced with the evidence  of falsification, Wright evaded Hough’s questions or made excuses to explain the hallmarks of forgery identified by COPA. Throughout Tuesday and Wednesday, Hough presented the court with document after document, pointing out timestamp and formatting inconsistencies that suggest the files Wright has presented as evidence that he invented Bitcoin were created after the date he claims, or altered at a later date.  In each instance, Wright defended the integrity of his documents, attributing discrepancies in their metadata to the way they have been handled over the years.  He occasionally used the excuse that the original ideas were recorded as voice notes or handwritten before being transcribed by his staff post factum.   During his cross-examination, Dr. Wright repeatedly blamed multiple file conversions for the presence of metadata that didn’t line up with his version of the timeline of events. Throughout questioning, Wright’s default explanation for discrepancies in metadata and document versions is that they arose from normal business practices rather than deliberate manipulation.  In case anyone is wondering… if Craig Wright is right about @Grammarly  Enterprise adding metadata to files without saving… NO!

However, COPA’s expert witnesses have contested these claims. At one point on Wednesday, Hough became frustrated with Wright’s increasingly stretched explanations for inconsistencies between the observable timestamps of evidence and the date Wright claimed he authored them. Responding to one such excuse, he observed that setting a file’s creation timestamp based on another year’s document “would be extremely eccentric,” and a “bizarre thing to do.” C: So you updated the year and month, but not the rest of the timestamp?W: Yes, it would be strange to change the clock twice.

Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin continues to be a center of attention for optimistic price forecasts while the U.S. regional banking system appears to be facing a downturn, echoing the challenges seen in the previous year. The leading cryptocurrency is once again attracting predictions of million-dollar valuations as the regional banking sector in the United States flirts with crisis. Nearly one year after the collapse of several banks, including the crypto-oriented Signature Bank , the entity that acquired it has seen a 60% decrease in its value since the beginning of the year. In an unfolding scenario that feels eerily familiar, the Bitcoin community is observing what some describe as the preliminary stages of another banking crisis in the U.S. As the first anniversary of the initial banking disturbances approaches, New York Community Bancorp (NYCB) has experienced a dramatic 30% fall  in its stock value over a mere five-day period. According to TradingView data , NYCB’s stock closed at $4.20 on February 6, signaling growing concerns about the bank’s stability. This downturn is particularly noteworthy given NYCB’s acquisition  of the beleaguered crypto-focused bank Signature last year—a fact that has not gone unnoticed in Bitcoin circles.

After a year of operation, the program is set to expire, a development Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX, a leading cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, believes  could set the stage for a rerun of last year’s turmoil.  During the initial crisis, Bitcoin’s value experienced a similar dip amidst growing uncertainty, only to stage a dramatic rally later. As if echoing that pattern, CCN previously reported on Hayes’ prediction of a potential drop to $30,000  this March, followed by a significant rebound. Furthermore, the financial woes of New York Community Bancorp (NYCB), exacerbated by Moody’s downgrading  its credit rating to junk, have prompted Hayes to reiterate his bold prediction of a $1 million Bitcoin valuation. His commentary  on X encapsulates a grim outlook for the future of traditional banking: “From junk to bankrupt, that’s the future.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin, which is still adjusting to the market dynamics following the introduction of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., has not shown significant price movements in response to these potential macroeconomic catalysts. According to data from CoinMarketCap , BTC/USD has been trading within a well-defined daily range for over 150 days, indicating a period of relative stability amidst global financial turbulence."

Key Takeaways
 The first day of a London court hearing hoping to establish (in British law at least) whether or not Craig Wright invented Bitcoin saw the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) accuse Wright of “forgery on an industrial scale.” On day 2 of the case, Wright took the stand to deny the allegations against him. Answering questions from COPA’s lawyer Jonathan Hough, Wright said he had never forged documents to prove his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto. Directing his questions at Wright on Tuesday, February 6, Hough asked the Australian computer scientist: “Have you ever forged or falsified a document in support of your claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto?” Wright replied that he hadn’t, nor had he ever knowingly presented forgeries supporting his claim. Back. C: The document was created by you, forged by you, backdated by you.W: No, it was not. Pulls up a doc from University of Newcastle. Not a reliance doc, but pleaded as forgery. It's a Word document with last-mod date 2005. There's a description, talks about ""rounds""… — Norbert ⚡️ (@bitnorbert) February 6, 2024   Among the evidence presented during questioning, Hough presented the infamous “origin myth” document: a research paper with Wright’s handwritten notes that he has claimed prompted his decision to use the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The essay  in question originates from the Japanese Studies Journal Monumenta Niponica and discusses the obscure Japanese philosopher Tominaga Nakamoto. Among his fans, Tominaga is an undiscovered gem of Japanese Rationalism, who might have become the Eastern Voltaire had his ideas not been repressed by the dominant Confucianism of the time. But besides sharing a name, his relationship to the inventor of Bitcoin isn’t immediately clear. Craig Wright first presented the Tominaga Nakamoto paper as evidence in a previous lawsuit, which also focused on the claim that he invented Bitcoin.  As with so much of the evidence Wright has presented to make his case over the years, he relied on the document’s timestamp, which shows that he downloaded the paper from JSTOR six months before the Bitcoin whitepaper dropped.  In a 2019 interview , Wright displayed the paper, with hand-written notes, declaring “I’ve just been digging up old documents. Trying to figure out what the horrible, horrible start of Bitcoin was.” From a few scrawled notes, which read “Nakamoto is the Japanese Adam Smith” and then “Satoshi is Intelligent History,” Wright argued that “I have the origin of where I chose the name Satoshi.” In a bid to poke holes in Wright’s story, COPA has claimed that the Tominaga Nakamoto paper contains a forged timestamp with numbers in visibly different fonts to make it look as if it pre-dates the Bitcoin white paper. Reflections on Day 2 of COPA v Wright, the identity issue. We're off to the races now! Today was predictably more interesting than yesterday, and brought a lot of the absurdity we expect from a Faketoshi trial. After having allowed Wright's new evidence just before closing… — Norbert ⚡️ (@bitnorbert) February 6, 2024   Questioning Wright during Tuesday’s hearing, Hough declared “this is a document forged by you as part of the origin myth.”  Wright denied the accusation, confidently asserting “if I forged that document, it would be perfect.” Of course, even if the timestamp can be proven to be original, all that would demonstrate is that Wright first accessed the paper in May 2008. The Satoshi notes, however, could still have been added at a later date."

Key Takeaways
 The first day of a legal showdown between the self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto, Craig Wright, and the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) was characterized by incendiary allegations and fierce disagreement over the facts at hand.  Court filings show that the defense intends to argue that Wright has produced “clear evidence” that he invented Bitcoin . Meanwhile, COPA’s lawyer Jonathan Hough spared no punches, accusing Wright of “forgery on an industrial scale.”  During a hearing at London’s High Court of Justice on Monday, February 5, Hough called Wright’s claim that he invented Bitcoin “a brazen lie” and “an elaborate false narrative,” supported by forged evidence.  Remarking that “there are elements of Dr Wright’s conduct that stray into farce,” he even suggested that the Australian computer scientist had used ChatGPT to produce the alleged forgeries. Now showing written testimony. Lynch points out a digital watermark that is not Satoshi's. Do you think Satoshi would furiously insert characters? Dr. Wright is a fabulist. — Norbert ⚡️ (@bitnorbert) February 5, 2024   Over the years, accusations of forgery have often clouded Wright’s attempt to assert his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto.  For instance, in a previous lawsuit, Wright presented a list of Bitcoin addresses he claimed ownership of as evidence in his complain t against W&K Info Defence. However, a message that the actual owner cryptographically signed stated  that the address “does not belong to Satoshi or to Craig Wright.” “Craig is a liar and a fraud,” they added.  Now as the COPA lawsuit unfolds, Wright’s credibility is once again being questioned. In a statement  submitted to the court responding to evidence provided by Wright, COPA has cast doubt on the authenticity of photographs purporting to show communications with the lawyer Denis Mayaka. The filing alleges that emails between Dr. Wright and Mayaka were forged and that the “Papa Neema” Gmail account allegedly belonging to Mayaka was “set up by Dr Wright for the purpose of creating evidence.”  According to the expert statement, photographs Wright claims were taken by Mayaka show his own computer screen. Zooming in on the photographs, the filing suggests that Dr. Wright’s photograph can be seen, demonstrating that he was logged into the Chrome browser shown. The evidence “[appears] to be photos of Dr Wright’s own computer screen, and to have been taken by him while he was actually in the process of creating forged documents,” the statement concludes. In court filings submitted ahead of Monday’s session, defense lawyer Anthony Grabiner argued that Wright has produced “clear evidence demonstrating his authorship of the white paper and creation of Bitcoin.” ""No competing claim"". Nobody else claims to be Satoshi, since 2016, despite multiple legal proceedings. Claimants are only interested in undermining Wright's claim, but are not interesting in knowing who Satoshi is. A real Satoshi has had every opportunity to come forward. Even… — Norbert ⚡️ (@bitnorbert) February 5, 2024   The centerpiece of Grabiner’s argument appears to be the dubious notion that “if Dr Wright were not Satoshi, the real Satoshi would have been expected to come forward to counter the claim.” As the case progresses, however, he will need to make a more convincing case than that if he wants to counter COPA’s allegations."

Key Takeaways
 MicroStrategy has started the year with another significant purchase of Bitcoin  (BTC), as disclosed by the company. In January, under the guidance of CEO Michael Saylor, the firm acquired 850 BTC for a total of $37.5 million, a transaction Saylor shared details of on X. This latest acquisition was also highlighted in the company’s fourth-quarter earnings  presentation for 2023, reaffirming MicroStrategy’s ongoing commitment to Bitcoin. During the fourth quarter of 2023 earnings  call on February 6, MicroStrategy’s Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Kang, revealed that the company had made significant Bitcoin investments throughout the year, acquiring 56,650 BTC at an average price of $33,580 each. This strategic move contributed to a notable financial turnaround for the business software firm, which reported a net income of $89.1 million for the year, a stark contrast to the loss of $249.7 million in 2022. However, the company experienced a slight decline in revenue, which fell by 6.1% to $124.5 million, as detailed in its statement.

This growth starkly contrasts with the approximately 95% increase seen in tech giants like Microsoft and Google during the same period. Michael Saylor highlighted that the introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) marked a pivotal moment, transforming Bitcoin from merely a medium of exchange to a recognized store of value. According to Saylor, this shift addresses and mitigates previous critiques of Bitcoin’s effectiveness as a currency. Saylor commented : “We don’t need to address any of the currency criticisms anymore. Simply as a store of value, there’s no reason Bitcoin can’t continue to outperform and 100X from where it is right now.” Despite concerns from cryptocurrency market experts that Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) providers like BlackRock and Fidelity could potentially erode MicroStrategy’s market share, Michael Saylor appeared unfazed by the prospect of competition from traditional finance entities. Saylor affirmed  that MicroStrategy’s focus would remain on its core mission to “create software.” Additionally, the company plans to collaborate with Bitcoin developers and contribute to developing Bitcoin-based layer-2 networks and other initiatives within the ecosystem, aiming to enhance its revenue streams in the future. Concluding the earnings call, Saylor reiterated  MicroStrategy’s commitment to expanding its Bitcoin holdings, signaling ongoing confidence in the cryptocurrency as a key asset for the company’s strategy."

Key Takeaways
 Less than a month has passed since the first spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) were listed in the US, yet the most popular have already amassed billions of dollars worth of investment each.  Although they still have a way to go before they catch up with Grayscale’s GBTC, Blackrock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) have risen to the top of the table in terms of inflows, raking in a over $5 billion between them at a time when GBTC has been hemorrhaging capital. At the close of trading on Friday, February 2, IBIT’s net assets value (NAV) stood at $3.12 billion , having attracted more investment than any of its peers in January. Meanwhile, FBTC had a NAV of $2.66 billion, more than triple that of its closest competitor – Ark Invest and 21Shares’ ARKB, which trailed behind in third place. As things stand, Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF remains the largest, holding Bitcoin worth $20.39 billion. But whereas 9 new spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in significant investment in January, GBTC has witnessed cumulative outflows of nearly $6 billion. Grayscale continues to sell. 121.000 $BTC  sold from the day Spot BTC ETF got approved. Majority of #Bitcoin  went to Blackrock and Fidelity clients.

In fact, IBIT and FBTC emerged as 2 of the most popular ETFs in January, joining a top ten list that has traditionally been dominated by funds that invest in the US government bonds and blue chip American stocks.  In a normal month, the 10 ETFs with the most inflows consist mostly of index funds that track the US stock market, with a handful of USD money market funds also in the mix. However, as Bitcoin funds made their debut in January, Morningstar data shows that only 1 bond-focused ETF made the top 10.

Not quite. The combined value of all Bitcoin funds is still dwarfed by the largest money market funds, which each hold bills, notes and bonds worth hundreds of billions of dollars.  Nevertheless, the significance of Bitcoin in global financial markets is now undisputed. If IBIT and FBTC sustain their current rate of investment, within 5 years they will rival the largest ETFs in existence today. "

Key Takeaways
 In a pivotal election, El Salvador’s populace seems to have resoundingly endorsed Nayib Bukele for a second presidential term , signaling a landslide triumph. The electoral decision largely reflects the nation’s willingness to exchange certain civil liberties for enhanced security, a critical issue in a country historically plagued by gang violence . Late on Sunday, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal released preliminary results, revealing that with 31% of polling stations reporting, Bukele had secured a commanding 83% of the vote . This figure significantly outpaces the 7% garnered by the closest contender from the leftist Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front. Notably, the electoral website tasked with updating the vote count experienced a crash just before the stroke of midnight. Nayib Bukele, at 42, is enjoying one of the loftiest approval ratings globally, largely attributed to his stringent measures against gangs in El Salvador,  which have notably curtailed homicide rates through the detainment of over 76,000 individuals. ⚡ 🇸🇻 President Bukele won the election in El Salvador by a whopping 87% last night.

Up until recently, El… pic.twitter.com/IRW2TuwtFX  — Megatron (@Megatron_ron) February 5, 2024   Bukele took to the social media platform X on Sunday to proclaim  his substantial lead in the presidential race, boasting more than 85% of the vote as per his “numbers,” and stating that his party, Nuevas Ideas, is set to secure at least 58 out of 60 congressional seats. De acuerdo a nuestros números, hemos ganado la elección presidencial con más del 85% de los votos y un mínimo de 58 de 60 diputados de la Asamblea. El récord en toda la historia democrática del mundo. Nos vemos a las 9pm frente al Palacio Nacional. Dios bendiga a El Salvador. — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) February 5, 2024   Additionally, an independent exit poll conducted by CID Gallup  suggested an even higher approval, estimating that 87% of Salvadoreans voted for the incumbent. These results are poised to establish Bukele, known for his adeptness on TikTok and his appeal as a millennial leader, as the first president of El Salvador to be re-elected since the 1930s. This follows a controversial decision by judges aligned with his party to overturn a ban on consecutive terms—a move that has sparked concerns about the nation’s democratic health. In a speech  to a vast crowd of supporters in downtown San Salvador, Nayib Bukele declared, “Here there is no polarisation,” emphasizing that “85 per cent of Salvadoreans have voted to continue the path we’re on in full freedom and full democracy.” Striving to reshape the international perception of El Salvador, often associated with poverty and violence, Bukele has initiated bold measures, notably the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender  in 2021. His anticipated victory, if validated, is set to virtually dissolve the already weakened opposition in the legislature, thereby solidifying his influence, which already extends over the judiciary and the military. JUST IN: Nayib Bukele: ""El Salvador has broken all records of all democracies in the world""; the new elected president of El Salvador delivers his first speech to a crowd of thousands of People. pic.twitter.com/BcM5lMCinc  — godfather (@Truthgodfather) February 5, 2024   Despite this consolidation of power, academics and civil society advocates express apprehension that Bukele might seek to alter the constitution to permit indefinite re-election —a notion he has refuted. However, his supporters argue that the people of El Salvador desire his prolonged leadership. In September 2021, Nayib Bukele officially introduced Bitcoin as legal tender  in El Salvador, a move accompanied by a series of supportive measures for digital assets, including the innovative introduction of ‘Volcano bonds‘. Per data from Nayib Tracker , El Salvador’s Bitcoin treasury presently holds 2,825 BTC, an investment with an approximate value of $120 million. Following an extended period of downturn in the bear market, Nayib Bukele’s Bitcoin holdings have finally seen a resurgence, edging into profitable territory at current market values. The average cost of acquisition per Bitcoin, standing at $42,443, is now marginally (0.3%) above the prevailing market rates, marking a cautious yet notable recovery. The daring move, not only captured global headlines but also ignited a niche trend of crypto tourism. However, the cryptocurrency initiative, while ambitious, elicited reservations from the IMF and saw limited adoption among the Salvadoran populace. During Bukele’s initial term, El Salvador’s economy has grappled with modest growth and limited foreign investment, further exacerbated by the steep costs associated with borrowing from international debt markets. These economic hurdles have intensified the need for a successful negotiation  with the IMF regarding a potential loan facility. However, insiders familiar with the discussions suggest that the IMF is poised to advocate for the revocation of Bitcoin’s status as legal tender within the country. The outcome of these negotiations remains uncertain, particularly given the Salvadoran government’s substantial investment of approximately $120 million in the cryptocurrency. It remains to be seen whether Bukele would concede to such a condition. Leaders from various Latin American countries, along with China —a nation Bukele has actively engaged for foreign investment  amidst strained relations with the US—were quick to extend their congratulations even before the official announcement of the election results. Extendemos nuestras más sinceras felicitaciones al Presidente @nayibbukele  y a su partido @nuevasideas , por el triunfo histórico en estas elecciones.Desde ya, nos ponemos a disposición para fortalecer lazos de amistad y la cooperación bilateral entre ambos países. — Embajada de la República Popular China en SV (@EmbajadaChinaSV) February 5, 2024   However, Bukele has been reticent about his specific plans for his upcoming second five-year term, set to commence in June. While the electorate endorses his stringent measures against gangs, there is a growing demand for enhanced economic opportunities, especially in light of projections indicating a modest 2% growth in the nation’s gross domestic product this year."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Craig Wright Trial Starts Today — Will Satoshi Nakamoto Finally be Unveiled?,https://www.ccn.com/news/craig-wright-trial-satoshi-nakamoto-unveiled/,"Dr. Craig Wright first claimed to be the Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto in 2016 but has yet to present any convincing evidence to back up his claim.  As a lawsuit brought by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) kicks off on Monday, February 5, Wright will need to make a compelling argument that he is who he claims to be. Otherwise, his Bitcoin copyright claims could be dashed for good. For as long as Wright has been publicly asserting that he authored the Bitcoin white paper, skeptics have pointed out that if he really was Satoshi, he could easily prove it by signing a message with Nakamoto’s verified PGP key or demonstrating ownership of one of the first Bitcoin private keys ever created. I conceived Bitcoin, and I unveiled it to the world. However, in BTC, they've torn it asunder. I've chosen to forsake BTC because I won't allow it to exist in a grotesque form, both in its physical embodiment and its underlying connotations. — Dr Craig S Wright (@Dr_CSWright) January 13, 2024   As it happens, Wright first became associated with the Bitcoin inventor thanks to the apparent discovery of such alleged signatures in 2016. The Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen can be credited with giving the story its most significant exposure after he claimed  to have witnessed  Wright sign something with private keys from the earliest Bitcoin block rewards. Upon closer scrutiny, however, the PGP signatures were soon debunked  as forgeries. What’s more, these days the Bitcoin community mostly accepts that Andressen was fooled by simple deception and Wright has never repeated the signing under close observation. But with the COPA lawsuit underway, there is no better evidence Wright could bring to trial. With members including Coinbase, Kraken MicroStrategy and WorldCoin, COPA’s stated mission is to “encourage the adoption and advancement of cryptocurrency technologies and to remove patents as a barrier to growth and innovation”. The organization’s beef with Wright stems from his attempts to copyright the Bitcoin white paper and parts of the Bitcoin database. The feud started when Wright attempted to sue various members for billions of dollars alleging intellectual property theft. In response, COPA filed a countersuit hoping to shut his copyright claims down for good. Unless he can present solid evidence that he authored the Bitcoin white paper, the lawsuit could be bad news for Wright. In the runup to the trial, a settlement offer that would have seen him renounce his copyright claims was rejected by COPA, which gave the proposal a “hard pass.” If you guys accept that offer it would have asserted that he owns Bitcoin IP. You have to own something to license it. I have no problem with CSW claiming title, but his claim on Bitcoin IP is a hard no. Nchain can do whatever with bsv but they don’t own Bitcoin. — Tyrael🧢 (@007_Xia) January 25, 2024   “Just like Craig Wright forges documents and doesn’t quite tell the truth, his description of the settlement offer isn’t quite accurate either,” the group said  in a statement.  According to COPA, Wright’s proposal “comes with loopholes that would allow him to sue people all over again.” It would also “force us to accept that he is Satoshi,” a prospect the organization is apparently unwilling to stomach.

Key Takeaways
 In a groundbreaking decision, the Biden administration has declared  the power usage associated with Bitcoin mining a national “emergency”. This pivotal stance aligns with the Department of Energy’s comprehensive endeavor  to collect extensive data from commercial cryptocurrency enterprises across the United States. The Department of Energy (DOE) revealed it is initiating a meticulous investigation  into the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining, a practice increasingly scrutinized for its environmental and sustainability implications. The core of this study  is to establish a comprehensive baseline of the crypto-mining industry’s landscape, meticulously tracking the evolution of mining activities, sourcing the electricity fueling U.S. crypto miners, and pinpointing regions with dense crypto-mining operations. This intensified focus on Bitcoin mining’s energy footprint underscores the growing concerns over its extensive computational demands and the consequent substantial electricity usage. The initiative aims to address the pressing issues related to the strain on power grids, energy security, and the overall environmental impact of this burgeoning digital economy sector. 🚨BREAKING: BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS DECLARED BITCOIN A FEDERAL “EMERGENCY” pic.twitter.com/vFhRWUiTc2  — Simply Bitcoin (@SimplyBitcoinTV) February 1, 2024   The Department of Energy (DOE) seeks to acquire a deeper understanding of the industry’s energy usage trends through its concerted effort to collect data from crypto-mining entities. This vital information will be instrumental in formulating measures to reduce the environmental impact of crypto mining and bolster the robustness of the United States’ power grid. Amidst the Biden administration’s heightened scrutiny of Bitcoin mining’s electricity consumption , speculations are brewing about potential underlying intentions. Industry insiders are pondering whether labeling the energy use of Bitcoin mining as an emergency serves as a pretext for introducing more stringent regulations or possibly setting the stage for a complete prohibition of the activity. Such actions could profoundly alter the trajectory of Bitcoin and other digital currencies in the U.S., potentially curbing innovation and constraining the growth of the digital economy.

 In a London court on Monday, prosecutors alleged  that Wen Jian converted Bitcoin into cash and real estate, effectively laundering funds from a massive $6.3 billion fraud. The fraud reportedly victimized nearly 130,000 investors in China in a period between 2014 and 2017. The 42-year-old faces charges  at London’s Southwark Crown Court for her role in concealing the origins of the stolen money. Despite facing three counts of money laundering, Wen Jian maintains her innocence and is not accused of participating in the initial fraudulent schemes. Prosecutor Gillian Jones identified Zhang Yadi, also known as Qian Zhimin, as the mastermind behind the $6.3 billion fraud scheme. According to Jones, Zhang, who is cited in the indictment as the beneficiary of the laundered funds, escaped to Britain with a fake identity in 2017 when Chinese officials initiated an investigation into the fraudulent operations. British prosecutors have charged a Chinese woman with money laundering, according to the FT. Zhang stole around £5bn from more than 128,000 Chinese investors through wealth management fraud between 2014 and 2017, before converting the money into Bitcoin and arriving in London in… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 30, 2024   While associates connected to the fraud have been apprehended in China, Jones highlighted that Zhang has successfully evaded capture. Furthermore, the stolen funds have yet to be recovered and returned to the defrauded investors. The jury learned that Zhang appointed Wen as a facade to obscure the origins of the pilfered funds, which were initially invested in Bitcoin to facilitate their transfer out of China. Upon arriving in London in 2017, Zhang sought to transform the Bitcoin holdings back into tangible assets like cash, real estate, jewelry, or other valuable items, as explained by Prosecutor Gillian Jones. Wen Jian has conceded her participation in the Bitcoin transactions, but the pivotal aspect of the trial revolves around discerning her level of awareness or suspicion regarding the illicit nature of the Bitcoin’s origins, as elucidated by Prosecutor Gillian Jones to the jury members. The case is ongoing. In a strategic move to combat financial crimes, the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) is set to enhance its capabilities in addressing cryptocurrency fraud. The expansion  includes the recruitment of four seasoned investigators, specifically designated to the financial crime unit, to address the increasing incidents of corruption and fraud associated with blockchain technology. Further strengthening its operations, the NCA’s Complex Financial Crime Team (CFCT) will integrate a new Digital Asset Disclosure Officer , extending its operational reach across various jurisdictions. This enhancement is aimed at ensuring a robust monitoring and enforcement mechanism in the evolving digital asset landscape. Collaboratively, the team is poised to work in tandem with a dedicated surveillance unit and the police department. This coordinated effort is crucial for the in-depth investigation of high-profile cases involving fraud and money laundering, particularly those orchestrated by sophisticated, organized criminal networks. The UK’s biggest taxpayer and algorithmic trader Alex Gerko wrote on Twitter last year that the crypto industry was “99% to 100% fraud or bullshit”. I agree. I just wish I paid as much tax as him! Sigh. Back to my modest self assessment form! https://t.co/in2nlIKm1I  — Paul Lewis (@paullewismoney) January 27, 2024   The initiative encompasses a comprehensive approach to tackling criminal activities within the digital domain, specifically focusing on severe and harmful offenses related to cryptocurrency and virtual assets. This includes addressing sophisticated fraud and money laundering operations conducted by major organized crime syndicates  and state-backed entities. The European Banking Authority (EBA) is actively pursuing a comprehensive update  to the Anti-Money Laundering and Combatting the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations, specifically targeting cryptocurrency service providers. Central to the EBA’s strategic initiative is the harmonization of AML/CFT guidelines across both payment service providers and crypto asset service providers (CASPs).

A pivotal element of the proposed enhancements involves advancing the interoperability of protocols among CASPs. This development mandates CASPs to evolve their systems to facilitate the smooth and integrated exchange of information, underscoring the EBA’s commitment to ensuring a robust, transparent, and cohesive regulatory framework in the evolving digital finance landscape."

Key Takeaways
 As of January 26, the SEC-approved 10 Bitcoin spot ETFs have seen 11 trading days. According to data from SoSo Value , the cumulative transaction volume during this timeframe amounted to $1.67 billion, with a total net asset value of $26.74 billion. Grayscale’s GBTC continues to register negative values , signifying a “net outflow.” On the last trading day of the previous week, January 26, GBTC recorded a single-day net outflow of $255 million, marking its smallest outflow since its initial trading day. After 10 trading days, the 9 new 🇺🇸 spot #Bitcoin  ETFs bought ~134,000 $BTC  worth $5.6 Billion USD👇  This excludes $GBTC  (conversion w/ outflows)$IBIT  $FBTC  $ARKB  $BITB  $BRRR  $BTCO  $HODL  $EZBC  $BTCW  pic.twitter.com/uWjP33OA4X  — CC15Capital 🇺🇸 (@Capital15C) January 26, 2024   As of January 26, GBTC has witnessed a cumulative outflow of $5.041 billion over 11 trading days according to Coinlive. In contrast, the other nine Bitcoin ETFs all reported net inflows on January 26. Fidelity’s FBTC led the pack with a substantial net inflow of approximately $100 million , followed closely by BlackRock’s IBIT , which reported a net inflow of $87.13 million.

Analysts  attribute the substantial outflow of funds from Grayscale GBTC to various factors. Firstly, the transition from Bitcoin Trust to Bitcoin ETF prompted early investors to redeem arbitrage opportunities. Furthermore, GBTC’s management fees, higher than those of comparable products in the market, likely incentivized early investors to change their positions, resulting in capital outflows. Consequently, Grayscale found itself selling the Bitcoins it manages to fulfill redemption requests. Current grayscale outflow I'm not a big fan of big weeks anymore pic.twitter.com/HWTwOwL038  — Kasper Vandeloock (@KasperLoock) January 23, 2024   This period of continuous capital outflow from Grayscale GBTC exerted selling pressure on the BTC spot market, causing the BTC price  to dip below $40,000 momentarily. However, as the net outflow from GBTC gradually slowed down, BTC prices made a recovery, with BTC passing the $42,000 mark on January 29. Since the launch of various Bitcoin spot ETFs on the US market on January 11, these products have collectively attracted a substantial $26.74 billion in investments over 11 trading days. However, on its inaugural trading day, January 11, GBTC recorded an outflow of $95 million, marking the smallest capital outflow of any day. Since then, GBTC has consistently witnessed daily outflows in the hundreds of millions. On January 22, GBTC experienced a single-day capital outflow exceeding $640 million, establishing a record for the largest single-day capital outflow thus far. The crypto asset market is closely monitoring the volume of Bitcoins being sold by Grayscale as funds continue to flow out of GBTC. According to the current rules governing this ETF attribute product, when an investor requests redemption or sale of GBTC, Grayscale is obligated  to sell an equivalent amount of Bitcoin to facilitate the investor’s redemption. Data from Lookonchain as of January 23 reveals that on January 11, Grayscale sold  over 2,000 Bitcoins. In the subsequent trading days of the Bitcoin ETF, Grayscale’s daily sales volume exceeded 10,000 coins, even reaching as high as 14,000 coins on two occasions. Nevertheless, despite experiencing significant capital outflows since its transition to an ETF, Grayscale GBTC has been stabilizing as the outflow slows down. This trend suggests that the Bitcoin ETF market is maturing and that investors are increasingly seeking access to Bitcoin through these regulated products."

Key Takeaways
 The SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs has garnered substantial attention, primarily for its potential to influence Bitcoin’s price in the near term.
 However, the more profound and enduring impact lies in the heightened challenge the US faces in regulating or prohibiting Bitcoin in the long run. Fifteen years ago, Satoshi Nakamoto brought attention to a persistent issue in the realm of monetary politics when he introduced the Bitcoin white paper . He highlighted the concern that governments possess a strong political incentive to devalue their official currencies, enabling them to spend beyond their means. Bitcoin white paper: Digital signatures provide part of the solution. Bitcoin core: Let's segregate the signature data. pic.twitter.com/7hqvCVKqYZ  — Daniel Street (@Daniel__Street) January 20, 2024   Consequently, governments are often enticed to augment spending without raising taxes, resorting to borrowing  to bridge the gap, and when that approach becomes unsustainable , they resort to creating more money by printing. In the long run, the proliferation of currency can erode the purchasing power of each individual, leading to inflation. #Crypto  Vs Inflation💥 👉Inflation erodes the purchasing power of traditional currencies over time. 💪One of the key strengths of many #cryptocurrencies , like #Bitcoin , is their capped supply, providing a hedge against inflationary pressures💸📉#SendCrypto  #SendersLife  #dApps  — SendCrypto_App / sendc.eth (@SendCrypto_App) January 25, 2024   Nakamoto and his peers aimed to address this challenge by capping the supply of Bitcoin at 21 million units. Unlike traditional fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar, euro, yen, or renminbi, which can be expanded by governmental authorities over time, the total number of Bitcoins in circulation cannot be easily manipulated by political actors.  If Bitcoin outshines the U.S. dollar as a store of value, concerns arise about a potential U.S. government ban on the cryptocurrency. Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio voiced  this concern, stating that “Outlawing Bitcoin is a good probability” due to historical parallels, such as the 1930s prohibition of private gold ownership and the imposition of foreign exchange controls. Trying to ban #Bitcoin  be like:  pic.twitter.com/GADWnpuVXm  — CRYPTOTAG (@CRYPTO_TAG) January 16, 2024   From a technical standpoint, a direct ban on Bitcoin by the U.S. government is implausible, given Bitcoin’s decentralized nature that operates independently of U.S. jurisdiction. While China banned Bitcoin mining  in 2021, a significant portion of mining continued in China through methods like virtual private networks.  Nonetheless, the U.S. could exert its influence by limiting dollar-to-bitcoin exchanges, restricting mainstream banks from engaging with Bitcoin businesses, imposing regulatory challenges on corporate Bitcoin holdings, and creating obstacles for retail businesses accepting Bitcoin as payment. In essence, while it cannot obstruct the Bitcoin network, the U.S. could make it cumbersome for average Americans to access and use Bitcoin, similar to historical measures like the 1933 prohibition  of private gold ownership. The approval of new Bitcoin ETFs is a pivotal development. It has enabled major financial giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco, and Franklin Templeton to hold billions of dollars in Bitcoin, making this cryptocurrency accessible to a broader range of investors who may have been hesitant to engage with cryptocurrency exchanges or manage private Bitcoin keys. This shift holds immense significance, intensifying the vested interest in expanding Bitcoin’s role within U.S. financial markets. Policymakers contemplating restrictive measures regarding Bitcoin will now encounter opposition not only from individual enthusiasts but also from influential financial players who wield considerable influence in Washington.  ""Crypto is clearly not the problem!"" Republic Senator Cynthia Lummis blasts Elizabeth Warren.https://t.co/t66wcmd0j4  — CCN (@CCNDotComNews) January 24, 2024   This dynamic heightens the challenges for policymakers looking to actively curb Bitcoin adoption, as special interest groups in Washington hold substantial sway in shaping policy decisions. Currently, over $25 billion  in Bitcoin is held in exchange-traded funds, with approximately one billion flowing in just two weeks after the SEC’s approval, representing substantial financial assets, even for industry giants like BlackRock. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC has been a contentious issue, as the Commission recognizes the complexities involved. While the SEC’s regulatory framework dictates that it should not determine Bitcoin’s investment suitability, it has steadfastly resisted offering investors exposure to Bitcoin through a mainstream, regulated financial instrument for the past decade. This resistance is driven by the SEC’s awareness that endorsing Bitcoin in this manner could significantly spur investor interest in the digital asset. I wonder what the AUM of these ETF products looks like after the first year fight for traction concludes.  Fee under cutting, mass advertising and publicly endorsing Bitcoin should not be ignored.#BTC  pic.twitter.com/00JpmFprkc  — McKenna (@Crypto_McKenna) January 25, 2024   The SEC’s greenlight for spot Bitcoin ETFs came only after unanimous legal pressure, prompted by a ruling  from Neomi Rao of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Rao’s opinion deemed the SEC’s resistance to Bitcoin ETFs as “arbitrary and capricious,” particularly given that the agency had already approved similar products for Bitcoin futures and other commodities.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler, while critical of Bitcoin as a “primarily speculative, volatile asset” with illicit uses, acknowledged  that Rao’s opinion compelled the Commission to act. Notably, two other Democratic appointees on the Commission, Caroline Crenshaw and Jaime Lizárraga, voted against the January ETF listings."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Bitcoin ETFs in Financial Markets: What’s the Long-Term Impact?,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-etfs-financial-markets-long-term-impact/,"The launch of the first US-listed spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) earlier this month marked the end of a year-long campaign for regulatory approval. But the real journey has only just begun.  As Bitcoin enters its ETF era, meaningful volumes of institutional money could flow into crypto for the first time. With the arrival of new capital sources, ETF managers are set to become major players in the global Bitcoin market – wielding what some predict will be hundreds of billions of dollars of buying power. According to one estimate, Bitcoin ETFs could raise $40 billion in 3 years, with the market ultimately swelling to over $400 billion.  Even though the cryptocurrency’s price has retraced by nearly 20% since the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) first announced its approval of 11 spot Bitcoin funds, at the close of trading on Monday, January 22, the new ETFs held assets worth nearly $27 billion. With a net asset value (NAV) of $22.95 billion, Grayscale’s GBTC is currently the largest of the lot. But rivals could soon close the gap. Unlike its peers, GBTC wasn’t always structured as an ETF. In its previous life as a unit investment trust, GBTC had a monopoly on the market for exchange-listed Bitcoin products and it still towers over other funds.  However, an exodus of Grayscale investors has already started to reshape the leaderboard. At present, the second and third largest funds, managed by BlackRock and Fidelity, have a NAV of $1.4 billion and $1.26 billion respectively. Bitcoin ETF Fund Flow Scorecard – Good & Bad News The bad news1) Grayscale dumped a ton of bitcoin2) For the 8th day in a row, GBTC transferred an additional 18,500 Bitcoin to Coinbase.The good news1) The majority of the sell-off involved FTX, which has now completed its… pic.twitter.com/SPiepYc4oB  — InvestAnswers (@invest_answers) January 23, 2024   With 3 ETFs already valued at over a billion dollars, Nansen’s Principal Research Analyst, Aurelie Barthere, told CCN that she expects the new funds will come to overshadow the whales that have traditionally influenced the price of Bitcoin, shifting the balance of power away from large individual investors. Even before ETFs arrived on the scene, the analysts noted that the concentration of ownership was already trending downward. Nevertheless, she said that 0.4% of BTC wallets still controlled as much as 60% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply. Going forward, “I would expect ETFs to accelerate this redistribution to new buyers, especially retail traders and retail investors,” Barthere said. Considering Bitcoin’s historical tendency for sensational interday price swings, the redistribution of coins and liquidity boost provided by new ETF investments could reduce market volatility, but Barthere cautioned against overstating the impact.  Bitcoin's current halving cycle is 93% complete. In the past two cycles, there was strong volatility at this time. And immediately after the halving, a steady growth started.#btc #cryptocurrencies  #bullrun  pic.twitter.com/RgHwN8qThj  — Ananta (@cryptoclubtitu) January 19, 2024   Although she predicted that ETFs will ultimately lead to less dramatic price spikes, “you can still have very major drawdowns, even in very liquid markets,” Barthere observed. “You still need to have the risk appetite to go into crypto,” she added, noting that the generally volatile nature of cryptocurrencies remains unchanged. For all its unpredictability, however, Bitcoin is still known to follow certain patterns. These too could fall under the influence of ETFs buying and selling activity. According to a 2022 study , Bitcoin trading activity typically peaks just after the opening of US stock markets. Meanwhile, price volatility tends to follow an M-shaped pattern, with 2 peaks that coincide with the opening of US and European exchanges. Post-ETF approval, asset managers based in New York and Chicago are set to drive an increased volume of trading activity. In turn, the cryptocurrency’s daily trade cycle may become even more synced to US Trading Hours. For example, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes predicted  that ETFs will drive “statistically significant trading behavior on and around 4 pm EST,” when they publish their NAV for the day.  Noting that Bitcoin ETFs calculate their NAV according to the CF Benchmark, which collates price data from various global crypto exchanges, Hayes said he anticipates a surge in arbitrage trading around that time as traders seek to leverage differences between the CF Benchmark and spot prices on individual exchanges. While cryptocurrency exchanges are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, synchronization with the trading hours of traditional securities exchanges implies their interconnectivity. Post-ETF launch, with Bitcoin no longer isolated from the world’s largest financial markets, the symbolic and material barriers that have historically separated crypto from traditional finance suddenly look flimsy. More than ever before, Bitcoin is now embedded within the core infrastructure of the global economy, marking the beginning of a new era for the world’s preeminent cryptocurrency."

Key Takeaways
 Advertisements for cryptocurrencies, exchanges, wallets, and related services are often regulated as financial promotions and platforms like Google Ads have specific measures in place to ensure compliance with the rules.  The latest update  to Google’s crypto advertising policy classifies a new type of restricted financial product, “cryptocurrency coin trusts”. From January 29, when the new rules come into force, certified advertisers will be able to promote Bitcoin Exchange Traded funds (ETFs), helping expand the cryptocurrency’s horizons across the internet. In the world of online marketing, it’s almost impossible to bypass Google Ads, which one survey found was used by 99%  of all websites. Given the platform’s extensive reach, placing ETF ads via Google could help promote them to a massive audience of potential investors.  Beneficiaries of Google’s new policy include ETF issuers like BlackRock and Fidelity, but brokers and financial advisors will also be able to place ads for crypto ETFs and related services.  Once advertisers start to promote Bitcoin ETFs, it could expose BTC to a new audience, away from the established base of crypto investors.  This is how you market to rich boomers, folks. The calm disposition, easy to understand inv case, soft new age music, suit with no tie.. everything about it says “it’s ok now, the adults are here” https://t.co/LmI2Ydy9rM  — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 14, 2024   Commenting on one of Blackrock’s first Bitcoin ETF advertisements, analyst Erich Balchanus remarked: “This is how you market to rich boomers.” In a departure from the style of many crypto ads in the past, the video is understated and grown up. And while it might not appeal to crypto bros or diehard Bitcoiners, they clearly aren’t the target. By nature, investing in regulated securities markets is a slower, more considered process, with investment advisors and other intermediaries often purchasing shares on behalf of wealthier, more mature clients. Of course, the websites they frequent will be different, as will the aesthetics that appeal to them. Nonetheless, Balchanus’ characterization of BlackRock’s ETF investor profile extends to Google Ads too. In the US and elsewhere, financial services advertisements are subject to specific rules designed to prevent the misrepresentation of what’s on offer. For example, advisors are prohibited from cherry-picking information to present investments in a better light. When it comes to crypto advertising, the notion of risk disclosure is especially important. As regulators around the world increasingly include crypto within the scope of financial promotion rules, statements explaining the risks involved have become a common feature of many adverts. In the latest update to its crypto promotions policy, Google said advertisers must comply with the local laws for any area that their ads target. Ads found to violate local regulations could lead to account suspension, the company stressed."

Key Takeaways
 The $20 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the world’s largest Bitcoin portfolio, has seen a slowdown  in outflows and financial strategists believe this might help alleviate the recent two-week downturn in Bitcoin’s value. JPMorgan analysts have observed a decrease in the downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, attributing this change to the completion of profit-taking activities related to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which recently converted into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Since its transformation into an exchange-traded fund on January 11, the fund has experienced  about $4.8 billion in withdrawals, exceeding JPMorgan’s initial estimate of approximately $3 billion. During this time, Bitcoin’s value has dropped by approximately 20%. According to JPMorgan : “There appear to be two emerging competitors to Grayscale’s bitcoin ETF: Blackrock and Fidelity, which have so far attracted $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion of inflows respectively. They both have much lower fees of only 25 basis points (without waivers) vs 150 basis points for GBTC.” JUST IN: 🇺🇸 JPMorgan says profit-taking on GBTC has largely concluded, expecting limited further downside for #Bitcoin   Bullish! 🚀 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) January 25, 2024   This shift from a closed-end format to an ETF allowed investors to end a widely-used arbitrage trade , leading to significant sell-offs, including those by the estate of the defunct FTX exchange. The daily outflow from the fund, also known as GBTC, reached its highest at $641 million on January 22 but decreased to $394 million by January 25. Sean Farrell, head crypto strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors said : “We’re starting to see a pattern of decreasing redemptions from GBTC. We’ll certainly need to see a few more days of follow-through, but a mere slowing down of this AUM exodus would serve as a large boost for the market.” The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust commenced trading in its new exchange-traded fund format on the same day that nine other spot Bitcoin ETFs, from major firms like BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments, made their debut in the U.S. These funds have collectively attracted over $5 billion in investments. The net inflow  into all ten spot Bitcoin ETFs combined is approximately $574 million. The good news: GBTC outflows trending down. The bad news: so are the Nine's. That leaves us with TOTAL ROLLING NET FLOWS of +$824m. Also $ARKB  and $BITB  crossing half a billion is remarkable. For any normal launch in first month that's considered blockbuster-level success. https://t.co/jPtlxhMtwP  — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 25, 2024   Shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which traded at a discount to its actual Bitcoin holdings since early 2021 while it was a closed-end product, have seen a shift since its conversion to an ETF. ETF units typically align closely with the net asset value, leading speculators to anticipate the elimination of this discount, which has now occurred. JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists, including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, noted  in a report that profit-taking from previous investments in GBTC at a discount to the net asset value last year has been a key factor in Bitcoin’s recent price correction. However, he suggested that such profit-taking has largely concluded, which could limit further downside risks for Bitcoin moving forward. He said: “In turn, this would imply that most of the downward pressure on bitcoin from that channel should be largely behind us.” Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has significantly influenced trading volume, establishing itself as a key tool for risk transfer in Bitcoin, according to  John Hoffman, Grayscale Investments’ managing director of sales and distribution. He mentioned earlier this week that the diverse shareholder base of GBTC will continue to implement strategies affecting inflows and outflows. Bitcoin experienced a remarkable surge of almost 160% last year, outshining traditional assets like stocks, fueled by expectations that the launch of U.S. spot ETFs would drive broader adoption among institutional and retail investors. However, since the beginning of the year, Bitcoin has been retreating and lagging behind global markets, as investors anticipate whether the initial excitement will translate into sustained reality. The group of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs has been noted as the most successful ETF launch in history in terms of trading and flow metrics. Don't know who needs to hear this. But ETFs aren't THE market themselves. Yes they're now a big slice of the pie but there's a lot more to the pie. Bitcoin ETF inflows can coincide with falling #bitcoin  prices. Outflows can coincide with rising prices. Shouldn't be confusing? — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 25, 2024   Bitcoin reached an intraday high of $49,021  on January 11, coinciding with the rollout of these funds, but later dropped to a low of $38,510 earlier this week. At the time of writing, the largest digital asset was trading  at $40,195. It had previously set a record high of nearly $69,000  during the 2021 pandemic-era crypto frenzy."

The Bitcoin set for U.S. government sale originally belonged to two individuals involved in separate criminal activities. The first batch was confiscated from Ryan Farace , a Maryland man convicted alongside his father in a money laundering scheme linked to darknet Xanax sales . This lot also includes Bitcoin stolen by Sean Bridges , a former U.S. Secret Service agent who was involved in the Silk Road investigations and pilfered Bitcoin earlier seized by the government.

Key Takeaways
 In April, the block rewards generated by Bitcoin miners will be slashed by 50% as part of the cryptocurrency’s 4-year halving cycle. In the short term at least, that means revenues for companies like Marathon Digital and RIOT Platforms will drop off a cliff. During the previous 2 halving events in 2020 and 2016, the consolidation of hash power among larger, more efficient setups essentially wiped out small miners, leaving only industrial operations able to compete. Now, as the next reduction in BTC rewards approaches, even the biggest players may not be able to survive. The primary concern for firms like Marathon and RIOT is that even before the halving, Bitcoin mining is generally only profitable when the market is up. To survive, miners need cheap electricity, and the industry is concentrated in places where it has the support of local governments and energy providers.  Bitcoin mining will be profitable above $38k post halving. pic.twitter.com/3bIywsTwQR  — Tom Dunleavy (@dunleavy89) January 12, 2024   In the US, for example, firms have flocked to Texas to take advantage of the state grid’s dynamic pricing and supply model, which increasingly relies on facilities like RIOT’s Rockdale mine to soak up excess electricity during periods of low demand.   Yet even with these incentives, 24 years after the company was founded, RIOT is only now on the cusp  of breaking even. Meanwhile, Mararthon’s path to profitability  has been shorter, but volatile market conditions in the runup to April could still derail its progress. Among publicly listed mining companies, many investors have reasoned that there are better-priced opportunities to be found among smaller firms with a value-to-sales ratio. In a recent analysis, Seeking Alpha observed that “Bitcoin mining companies might not survive a 50% cut in Bitcoin mining revenue.” Given the expected hit to their income from April onward, the report concluded that many miners are currently overvalued. $RIOT  – Riot Platforms: A Potential Core Scientific In The Making. https://t.co/Q54YrLQJnS  #stockmarket  #finance  #markets  — Seeking Alpha (@SeekingAlpha) January 24, 2024   Specifically, it pointed to RIOT’s current market capitalization of $2.12 billion, which has already fallen by around $900 million since peaking last year. In the coming months, the report predicted RIOT’s stock market valuation falling even further, highlighting the $1 billion mark as a recommended entry point for investors. Seeking Altha drew a comparison between RIOT and Core Scientific, which was once one one the biggest publicly traded mining companies, but went bust last year after a dramatic reversal of its fortunes during 2022’s crypto winter. Core Scientific’s decline serves as an important lesson for miners today. No company is too big to fail in a highly competitive industry, where razor-thin margins can easily be erased by market downturns .  Even Marathon, which by most measures is the world’s largest Bitcoin miner, could still struggle if the price of Bitcoin falls too low to support its operational costs. Marathon Digital Holdings is gearing up for the #Bitcoin  halving by optimizing its mining operations with low-cost renewable energy, diversified mining sites, and a vertically integrated tech stack from the mining pool to the ASIC. pic.twitter.com/EGRzx5QXNY  — Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA) (@MarathonDH) October 20, 2023   In the run-up to the halving, Marathon has been doubling down on efficiency, scaling its operations and cutting costs. Nonetheless, market analyst Pollock Mondol recently observed  that the company’s cost structure remains higher than many of its peers. Should Bitcoin prices dip below $30,000 post-halving, he concluded that Marathon’s profit margins would be wiped out, putting its entire business model in jeopardy."

Key Takeaways
 Career Bitcoin hater Peter Schiff is at it again, peddling the same argument he’s been making for over a decade. Since 2013, Shiff has called Bitcoin  a ponzi, a pyramid, a scam, and all manner of other slurs, always delivered with an equally exuberant endorsement of his favorite investment, gold. Which begs the question: what does he have to gain from repeating the same thing over and over again? Officially, Schiff usually refers to himself as an economist or a strategist. He started his career in the 90s as a Lehman Brothers stock broker before founding Euro Pacific Bank, which collapsed in 2020 under the pressure of mounting tax evasion and money laundering controversies. But although his credentials as a banker might be questionable, Schiff’s career as a Bitcoin critic emerged unscathed from Euro Pacific’s insolvency. “This is how Bitcoin works” he declared on Wednesday, January 24. “We create something with no value, then artificially limit its supply. Then we all pretend it has value and buy it. Other people see the price going up and they buy it too,” the X post went on. True to form, Shiff wrapped it up by shilling his EuroPac gold fund as the bearer of “real value” that BTC could never approximate. My gold fund invests in companies that mine gold. They own reserves of gold and can generate a profit by mining it. So they are real businesses that can have real value to shareholders. If gold does what I think it will, those companies will be far more valuable in the future. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 25, 2024   At the time of writing, Schiff’s latest social media rant has been shared 550 times, generating more than half a million views, 2,400 comments and around 3,200 likes. In general, his anti-Bitcoin posts generate significantly more interest than the predictable economic critique, election commentary and reposted ShiffGold promotions that make up the rest of his feed.  In a digital economy where social media engagement is the most valuable currency of all, the veteran investor appears to have found a winning formula.  On public social media platforms, the inauguration of Schiff’s “Bitcoin is a bubble you should all buy gold” spiel can be traced back to a 2013 YouTube video in which he contrasted the “speculative” value of BTC with the “intrinsic” value of gold. Of course, Shiff does have a point. No one makes jewelry out of digital currency. Nor can it be used to garnish deserts, insulate spacecraft or treat lagophthalmos. But ultimately, these diverse use cases for gold have far less impact on its price than the combined buying power of bullion-hoarding bank reserves and mutual funds, for whom Gold’s value is rooted in the knowledge that it can always be swapped for cash. What’s more, while the price of gold has increased by around 60% in the last 10 years, BTC has surged by more than 4500% during the same period. Not bad for something that Shiff once insisted “does not have a store of value.” Despite the endurance of Schiff’s cryptocurrency reservations, skeptics may still question their veracity. The online gold broker he owns accepts payment in BTC, BCH and ETH, but it relies on social visibility to generate traffic. With that in mind, why would the head of SchiffGold renounce a guaranteed source of free publicity?"

Key Takeaways
 Since the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this month, Bitcoin has experienced significant selling pressure, resulting in a 20% price drop. Consequently, the BTC price plummeted to $39,000 earlier this week. Despite ongoing selling pressure, Bitcoin whales have been actively purchasing during these dips. In the current market correction, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has observed  a notable trend: Bitcoin whales are undeterred by the volatility and are actively increasing their BTC holdings. Even amidst this market correction, #Bitcoin  whales are not slowing down – they're accumulating more $BTC ! In fact, there's been a notable increase in major players: 46 new entities now hold 1,000 #BTC  or more, marking a 3% increase in just two weeks. pic.twitter.com/GVNInKW7A2  — Ali (@ali_charts) January 24, 2024   Martinez’s analysis reveals a significant development in the crypto sphere, with an influx of 46 new entities, each holding over 1,000 BTC. This marks a 3% rise in the number of major Bitcoin holders in just two weeks, highlighting the resilience and strategic actions of these whales amidst market uncertainties. The BlackRock iShares spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT) has experienced a remarkable influx of nearly $42 billion since its launch, as reported  by Rachel Aguirre, Head of iShares Products for BlackRock in the U.S. The IBIT ETF witnessed a significant increase  in trading volume within its first two weeks, hitting $3 billion and demonstrating its strong impact on the market. This surge in inflows reflects a growing interest among investors in cryptocurrency-related investment products, potentially laying a foundation for a long-term BTC price rally. We are now at 8 consecutive days of #Bitcoin  whale withdrawals, outpacing deposits. The rate of change of new whales coming in is remarkable.  Whale accumulation https://t.co/WLGDGmlnqy  pic.twitter.com/i8BMqk0TmF  — James Van Straten (@jvs_btc) January 25, 2024   Adding to this, Martinez has analyzed historical Bitcoin trends, suggesting that if current market trends follow past patterns seen from 2015-2018 and 2018-2022, the next Bitcoin market peak could potentially occur around October 2025 Martinez’s compelling forecast suggests that BTC could experience around 600 days of bullish momentum ahead, based on his analysis. Recent analysis from Datamish  has shed light on the intriguing behavior of Bitfinex whales, particularly their ongoing pattern of closing long positions. A notable decrease of 3,500 BTC in early December brought the total to 76,500 BTC. Despite Bitcoin’s rollercoaster ride, reaching a high of $49,000 and then dropping below $39,000, significant shifts have been observed. On January 14, long positions hit a low at approximately 68,000 BTC, but soon saw a revival with an increase of about 6,000 BTC, raising the total to over 74,000 BTC by January 25. Alistair Milne highlighted  the whales’ strategic approach on January 23. They have been implementing a time-weighted average price (TWAP) strategy, involving the purchase of 10 Bitcoins on margin every 15 minutes. Bitfinex whale continues to TWAP buy 10BTC on margin every 15 mins https://t.co/Zp3MSgpkPv  pic.twitter.com/sax4s1JgAs  — Alistair Milne (@alistairmilne) January 23, 2024   This method, commonly used in financial markets, aims to reduce the market impact of large orders by distributing a big order into smaller ones over time. These strategic maneuvers suggest a deliberate strategy employed by Bitfinex whales, which may have an impact on the movements of the Bitcoin market."

Key Takeaways
 Claiming to be the inventor of Bitcoin, Dr. Craig Wright has spent the last 5 years trying to copyright Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper, as well as the Bitcoin file format and parts of its database. After the US Copyright Office rejected Wright’s intellectual property claims, he turned his attention to the UK, where the issue is now playing out in parallel court cases. Hoping to resolve the matter before it goes to trial, on Wednesday, January 24, Wright offered his opponents a settlement deal . But certain aspects of Wright’s proposal may not go down so well. Dr. Wright’s UK copyright claims target some of the biggest names in crypto. Defendants in 3 separate lawsuits include Bitcoin Core developers, Coinbase, and Payward, which owns Kraken. For alleged intellectual property theft, Wright has sued for damages of hundreds of billions of pounds collectively.  Under the umbrella of the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA ), his opponents filed a counterclaim  last year, “to disprove the claim made by Wright that he is Satoshi Nakamoto.”  If a single development group (Blockstream, COPA, Core etc), especially one owned by a large corporation like Meta, were to assume control over Bitcoin, it would represent a significant shift towards centralisation. This centralised control would be antithetical to the… — Dr Craig S Wright (@Dr_CSWright) January 24, 2024   Although he hasn’t offered to renounce his claim to being the Bitcoin inventor, Wright’s proposed settlement appeals to one of COPA’s stated goals: ensuring that the Bitcoin database remains a public good, free and accessible to all. Under the deal, Wright and the various COPA members “shall not pursue and are prevented from pursuing any database rights or copyrights” and shall be granted “irrevocable license in perpetuity to exploit, use, assign or license,” products that incorporate the Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash databases.  On the surface, Wright’s offer to renounce all Bitcoin copyright claims placates COPA’s concerns. However, the proposed settlement includes language that members may object to. For starters, by agreeing to Wright’s terms, COPA would essentially endorse him as the inventor of Bitcoin. All parties to the deal would commit to “cease claiming that they represent the original Bitcoin as envisioned by me as Satoshi Nakamoto,” his settlement offer states. Moreover, the specific vision for Bitcoin outlined in the settlement could cause trouble for certain COPA members, who would need to publicly acknowledge that “the intended purpose for creating Bitcoin was to create a system to provide micropayments.” Broadly speaking, the reference to micropayments aligns with the views of the Bitcoin Core developers named in Wright’s lawsuit. Nevertheless, they are unlikely to relish the prospect of committing to something that could come back to bite them in the future.  Hard pass on that ""settlement."" Just like Craig Wright forges documents and doesn't quite tell the truth, his description of the settlement offer isn't quite accurate either – it comes with loopholes that would allow him to sue people all over again. — COPA (@opencryptoorg) January 24, 2024   Likewise, COPA members whose interest in Bitcoin is motivated by profit have no reason to favor any particular vision for how the technology is used. On the contrary, they would probably rather retain the freedom to choose the most advantageous path at any given juncture. In a statement on X , COPA outlined its response to Wright’s offer in no uncertain terms. “Hard pass on that ‘settlement’,” the post declared. On the one hand, the organization objects to acknowledging Wright as Satoshi Nakamoto. On the other, it argued that “the settlement comes with loopholes that would allow him to sue people all over again”."

Key Takeaways
 Adam Back, a central figure in the early 2000s cypherpunk movement, who played a significant role in shaping the digital currency landscape, addressed the fears surrounding the recent Mt. Gox situation. Back’s contributions to the development of digital cash , proof of work mechanisms, and online anonymity have been foundational to the cryptocurrency space. Back pointed out  the illogical nature of selling Bitcoin, which has been held for a decade since its value was around $450, at the current price of $40,000. He highlights  the potential growth ahead, citing the upcoming Bitcoin ETF tailwind and the approaching halving event in the crypto market. Back suggests that waiting another year could see values soaring to $400,000 and beyond. re @mtgox  fud: after a 10 year forced HODL from $450, what kind of 🤡 would market dump at $40k, with ETF tailwind about to hit, in an early bull market leading into a halving, vs say just wait another year for $400k+. doesn't make any sense to me either. just cold store them. — Adam Back (@adam3us) January 24, 2024   In a follow-up tweet , Back noted the distinct approach Mt. Gox has taken in its bankruptcy proceedings compared to FTX. Mt. Gox is paying out creditors in Bitcoin rather than converting it to USD for legal expenses. This strategy, he points out, is more favorable for creditors, who would have been much worse off with a payout based on the original $450 valuation. This decision to pay in Bitcoin ensures that creditors receive a significant portion of their Bitcoin balance, rather than a depreciated dollar value, highlighting a unique aspect of cryptocurrency in bankruptcy scenarios. and note @mtgox  is paying out in BTC and kept the BTC (not sold for bankruptcy legal expenses), they did not sell them to USD unlike the US bankruptcy approach of @FTX_Official . or creditors would be even sadder with $450 *0.2 = $90/btc rather than 20% of bitcoin balance. — Adam Back (@adam3us) January 24, 2024   In another tweet, Back mentioned the presence of institutional claim buyers , who he believes were primarily interested in purchasing and holding discounted Bitcoin. He noted that out of the 200,000 BTC discovered by the ex-CEO of Mt.Gox, Mark Karpeles, a total of 142,000 BTC remained, while bankruptcy lawyers utilized the remaining 56,000 BTC over ten years. there were also institutional claim buyers, but i think they were BTC basis, looking to buy-up and hold discounted BTC. total BTC left 142k out of the 200k found by @MagicalTux . bankruptcy lawyers spent the other 56k btc over the 10 years. — Adam Back (@adam3us) January 24, 2024   In a recent interview at a cryptocurrency event in Lugano , Switzerland, the co-founder and CEO of Blockstream shared his insights into the nature of Satoshi Nakamoto’s cryptocurrency. He emphasized that Bitcoin primarily serves as digital gold, a characteristic he considers more significant than its role as a medium of exchange. Have a look#Bitcoin  #GOLD  #Savings  pic.twitter.com/BwN9DDJAvf  — Max (@themaxhere) December 30, 2023   Expanding on this analogy, Back likened physical gold to a form of technology, requiring specific techniques for its discovery, extraction, and processing. He drew a parallel between these technological aspects of gold and Bitcoin, suggesting that Bitcoin effectively acts as a digital counterpart to gold. Back implied that gold’s status as a financial asset is largely due to its scarcity, a trait that inherently involves high costs for extraction. Similarly, despite Bitcoin’s fixed supply, the digital world typically allows for scalability and replication. This raises the question: how can the element of scarcity be replicated for a digital asset in the real world? Back provides a solution: “Through the high costs, the high energy work, necessary to carry out the validation of transactions. In other words: mining. This is why Bitcoin is digital gold. An asset characterized by scarcity, immutable and authentic thanks to the blockchain, which can also be transferred over long distances and stored at little expense.”"

Key Takeaways
 In the last week, the global crypto market has been gripped by a bearish mood that has pushed the price of Bitcoin below $40,000 for the first time since early December.  The pullback appears to have been catalyzed by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. After months of anticipation, when the new funds finally launched it instigated a major selloff as traders sought to take their profits from a rally that had lasted since early October.  Without ETF hype buoying the Bitcoin market, a post-approval correction has already shaved more than 10% off the cryptocurrency’s price, but many analysts expect to see further losses before it rebounds. Having fallen below $40,000 on Tuesday, January 23, BTC is now on track to test the next support level at $38,000. If it breaks through that floor, CCN analyst Nikola Lazik has observed  that its ability to defend $36,00 will be crucial. If it can’t, he noted that a prolonged correction could see prices fall as low as $26,800. But what’s behind the current downtrend? In comments shared with CCN, Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, observed that a decrease in average profits for short-term holders could is often a precursor to further selloffs.  “Since the BTC price has fallen and stayed below the $43,000 level, over half of the profits accumulated by short-term holders have been wiped out,” Kooner observed. In fact, he said that many people who acquired Bitcoin in the past month are now exiting the market at a loss. As traders move to lock in remaining profits or minimize their losses, such behavior could potentially reinforce the current downtrend.  In a recent blog post, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes said he anticipates macroeconomic headwinds dragging down crypto markets between now and March. According to Hayes’ thesis, the price of Bitcoin will hit a low point after March 12, when the  Bank Term Funding Program (BTFT) – a US Treasury scheme introduced last year to support struggling banks – is scheduled to wind down. Forecasting that the end of the program will coincide with the Reverse Repo Program (RRP) balance (i.e. the amount of cash US banks park with the Federal Reserve overnight) shrinking to nearly zero, he argues that the combination of these 2 factors threatens to “decimate” financial markets, instigating a decline of up to 30% in the price of Bitcoin.  After that, the next key date Hayes identified is the Fed’s rate-setting meeting on March 20, when the expects the central banks to cut interest rates in an attempt to ease the pressure on indebted banks. Presuming events play out as he anticipates, he predicted “Bitcoin initially will decline sharply with the broader financial markets but will rebound before the Fed meeting.” $BTC  Update: Current Trends 📊 As Bitcoin holds above the crucial $35,000 support level, it's likely moving in a wave 4 pattern, indicating a direct bullish scenario.

Arguing that the Bitcoin market has priced in a favorable macro environment, she said any upsets for the US economy “would be a challenge for crypto.” However, like Hayes, she pointed to anticipated Fed rate cuts as a potential source of relief, noting that the decision to hold interest rates stable toward the end of 2023 helped catalyze rising crypto prices.

Emphasizing the need for innovation, Marcus declared his lifelong dedication  to enabling money to flow natively on the internet, with a particular focus on utilizing Bitcoin. He clarified that this modernization of financial transactions is his primary goal and area of work for the foreseeable future. State of payments in 2024, ladies and gentlemen.

Marcus recently shared his views on Bitcoin , distinguishing it from other cryptocurrencies. Speaking on the “What Bitcoin Did” podcast , Marcus, who is also the founder of the Lightning Network payments protocol Lightspark, expressed a firm belief that Bitcoin stands alone as a unique digital currency. He articulated his “unshakeable conviction” that Bitcoin represents the sole form of neutral internet money that will exist. He stated : “Bitcoin has more regulatory clarity than any other crypto asset out there. It is widely accepted by a lot of regulated financial institutions. Fidelity [Investments] has a Bitcoin-denominated 401k, and there are a bunch of spot Bitcoin ETFs that are awaiting approval. Eventually, it’ll happen. And outside of the US, banks can touch Bitcoin and do, and they want to really embrace the capabilities that Bitcoin brings to the table.” Marcus believes that Bitcoin’s longevity is assured, having surpassed the stage of existential threats. While he acknowledges that such threats are not entirely eliminated, he asserts that among all digital assets, both existing and potential, Bitcoin is significantly better prepared to withstand various types of attacks and challenges. Marcus believes  Bitcoin could revolutionize online transactions, enabling the seamless transfer of billions of dollars in near real-time. He sees this as an incredibly exciting opportunity to redefine the way financial transactions are conducted globally. At @Lightspark , we believe #Bitcoin  will become the TCP/IP for realtime value transport on the Internet. The opportunity to reinvent how trillions of dollars of value moves every day and make it always-on, low-cost, open, and realtime is incredibly exciting. — David Marcus (@davidmarcus) January 16, 2024   As the CEO of Lightspark, David Marcus plays a pivotal role in leading the transformative journey of Bitcoin. In September 2023, he emphasized its goal  to evolve Bitcoin into a genuine global payment network.

Key Takeaways
 Last week saw a decrease in worldwide interest in cryptocurrency investment products, resulting in $21 million in outflows . This contrasts with the previous week when crypto funds experienced $1.25 billion  in inflows, following the introduction of 10 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States. On January 10, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, resulting in the introduction of nine new funds into the market. The recent downturn was primarily influenced by Grayscale Investment’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (GBTC), which accounted for $2.2 billion in withdrawals. FTX’s bankruptcy estate played a significant role in the recent large-scale withdrawal  from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), offloading 22 million shares, as Matthew Dixon, CEO of Evai, shared on X. This move significantly impacted the fund, which had been in operation for a decade as a less attractive closed-end fund before its conversion to an ETFF. At the time of the SEC’s approval of GBTC’s transformation  and the introduction of new bitcoin ETFs, GBTC had amassed nearly $30 billion in assets. Liquidation of FTX Shares: The recent move by Grayscale, transferring 900,000,000 worth of BTC to Coinbase, aimed at selling them, aligns with a clear motivation – the liquidation of FTX shares. This calculated strategy allowed FTX to sell its GBTC holdings at an opportune time… pic.twitter.com/daMpF0vNqa  — Matthew Dixon – CEO Evai (@mdtrade) January 23, 2024   In contrast to GBTC, which has seen billions in outflows, new spot Bitcoin ETFs from entities like BlackRock and Fidelity, which began trading on January 11 following SEC approval, have experienced significant inflows. The data indicates that FTX’s divestment was a major factor in GBTC’s outflows. The sale of FTX’s entire GBTC stake,  amounting to 22 million shares valued at close to $1 billion, marks a substantial shift in the landscape of bitcoin investment products. In the dynamic spot Bitcoin ETF market, Bitwise secured the third position in inflows, amassing $395.5 million, closely followed by Ark Invest/21Shares and Invesco with $320.9 million and $194.9 million respectively.

Ark Invest/21Shares and Bitwise followed with $41.8 million and $20.1 million in inflows. This period of market adjustment seems to be winding up. Expectations for GBTC fees dropping should be tempered – they said they think they are worth it, and GBTC outflows are more or less steady with BlackRock and others hoovering up anything they shed. Net inflows are positive. pic.twitter.com/u6VXET1iqu  — Samson Mow (@Excellion) January 18, 2024   Over the week, the market experienced fluctuations, with a return to net inflows of $474 million on the last Wednesday, contrasting starkly with net outflows on the last Tuesday and the largest outflow on the fifth day of trading. Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity remained prominent in trading volume and assets under management, cumulatively nearing a trading volume of $14 billion, with Grayscale’s GBTC, BlackRock’s IBIT, and Fidelity’s FBTC contributing significantly. Just a week ago, in its initial trading days as an ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust experienced significant withdrawals, with investors pulling out approximately $579 million. This shift came after the US SEC approved its conversion from a trust to an ETF last week, as previously reported. The outflow from this fund contrasts sharply with the combined inflows of nearly $819 million into the other nine spot Bitcoin ETFs. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, highlighted the impact of the ETF conversion  on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), noting that this transition has allowed for a clearer understanding of the fund’s flow dynamics. Seyffart pointed out that the withdrawals might be indicative of investors capitalizing on profits. Day 5 #Bitcoin  ETF Cointucky derby update.

Key Takeaways
 Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest, has firmly countered JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon’s disparaging statements about Bitcoin , where he likened the digital currency to a “pet rock,” and said it has “no intrinsic value”. This reaction from Wood follows Dimon’s recent remarks at the World Economic Forum , where he reaffirmed his previous negative view of Bitcoin, calling it “worthless” and a “hyped-up fraud.” Among other things, Wood stated  that Dr. Arthur Laffer, renowned for the Laffer Curve  and a scholar in monetary economics mentored by Nobel laureate Robert Mundell , viewed Bitcoin as a return to a private, rules-based monetary system. He considered this development to potentially be the most significant advancement in global monetary history. Dr. Arthur Laffer, of Laffer Curve fame, also is a monetary scholar, mentored by Nobel Prize winner Robert Mundell. He believes that bitcoin – the return to private rules-based money – could become the most positive step forward in global monetary history. https://t.co/tdzGPWSAc3  — Cathie Wood (@CathieDWood) January 21, 2024   In her compelling response, Wood referenced a post by Yassine Elmandjra , ARK Invest’s Director of Digital Assets, to counter the JPMorgan CEO’s assertions. In a recent series of Twitter posts , Elmandjra has boldly countered Jamie Dimon’s assertions about Bitcoin. Dimon, known for his skeptical views on Bitcoin, has claimed that the cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value and that it remains largely unused. He also referenced the latest Vanguard decision not to include Bitcoin ETFs into its offer. Elmandjra argues  that while Bitcoin’s value drivers are distinct from traditional assets, it’s misleading to say it has no intrinsic value. Unlike conventional cash flow-based assets, Bitcoin’s worth lies in its unique properties that resonate with both historical and modern monetary system requirements. Claim: ""Bitcoin has no intrinsic value"" Counter-claim: Bitcoin is a contender for the role of a global money.

Contrary to Dimon’s claim, Elmandjra highlights staggering usage statistics  that paint a different picture. According to him, Bitcoin’s usage statistics are impressively substantial, with a cumulative transaction volume reaching $41.6 trillion and a total of 954 million transactions. Alongside these figures, Bitcoin boasts a cumulative miner revenue of $58.8 billion, over 51.7 million addresses with a non-zero balance, and a market cost basis of $440 billion, reflecting its significant presence and activity in the financial landscape. Claim: “No one uses Bitcoin.” Counter-claim: Have you seen the numbers?

The transaction volume and count showcase the cryptocurrency’s active and growing ecosystem, while the significant miner revenue underscores its economic impact. The substantial number of addresses with a non-zero balance further attests to its wide user base. Elmandjra’s response to Dimon’s criticism sheds light on the misconceptions surrounding Bitcoin. By presenting concrete data and emphasizing Bitcoin’s unique monetary properties, he makes a compelling case for the cryptocurrency’s intrinsic value and its evolving role in the global financial system. As the debate continues, these insights contribute significantly to the ongoing discourse about Bitcoin’s place in the future of money. Despite Jamie Dimon’s skeptical remarks about Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency’s market performance tells a different story. Currently priced around $41,200, Bitcoin has experienced a surge of around 100% in the past year . This impressive growth has caught the attention of top asset management firms like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, and WisdomTree, leading them to launch their own spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Key Takeaways
 Mike Novogratz, a well-known personality in the cryptocurrency sphere, has maintained an optimistic view  of Bitcoin’s (BTC) future prospects. His positive sentiment follows a contentious discussion about the possible effects of Grayscale’s recent choices concerning the fees for its exchange-traded fund (ETF). In the wake of Grayscale’s decision to keep a 1.5% fee on its Bitcoin Trust ETF, the crypto community has seen differing viewpoints emerge. Chris J. Terry , a prominent analyst, forecasted a bleak short-term outlook for Bitcoin, pointing to potential selling pressures as a key factor. Contrasting this, Mike Novogratz, a figure renowned for his expertise and influence in the crypto world, has publicly contested this pessimistic view . I disagree with this. While I think people will sell GBTC, I think most will switch into other ETFs – $BTCO  being my favorite !!  Let’s not miss the forest through the trees. It’s now gonna be far easier for boomers to buy corn. And you can get 4×5 times leverage on this… https://t.co/ZJhumt3tzx  — Mike Novogratz (@novogratz) January 21, 2024   Novogratz argues that while there might be an initial sell-off of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust(GBTC) holdings, he anticipates that investors will likely reallocate their investments to other Bitcoin ETFs, especially BTCO. He highlights that the presence of these ETFs provides easier access for a broad spectrum of investors, including those from older demographics, to invest in Bitcoin. Additionally, he indicates the prospects for investors to amplify their Bitcoin investments, suggesting the possibility of using four to five times leverage. The ongoing debate about the future of Bitcoin has drawn insights from a range of industry experts. While Mike Novogratz maintains a bullish outlook on Bitcoin, entities like JPMorgan adopt a more cautious view, anticipating selling pressure following Grayscale’s recent decision. This pessimistic sentiment is shared by various financial analysts who foresee the approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs as a potential catalyst for a drop in Bitcoin’s price. In contrast, analysts such as Tuur Demeester  present a more optimistic scenario. Demeester emphasizes Bitcoin’s ability to remain resilient amidst adverse news, noting its trading patterns within predictable ranges and adherence to expected resistance levels. This view is in line with Novogratz’s perspective, suggesting Bitcoin’s capacity to endure and thrive through market fluctuations. Huge negative news coverage for bitcoin and yet, it has simply hit some predictable resistance and is now trading in a range. pic.twitter.com/vVdUhoOkri  — Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) January 21, 2024   As the discussions evolve, the cryptocurrency community is closely monitoring Bitcoin’s path. Novogratz’s forecast of a Bitcoin value surge in late 2024  offers an alternative to the prevalent cautionary views. His analysis, based on the notion that current market challenges are temporary, injects a sense of hope and confidence in Bitcoin’s future."

Key Takeaways
 During the week from January 7 to 14, 2024, Google Trends data  indicated that the search term ‘Bitcoin’ reached its highest interest score of 100. An analysis of the three-month trends  leading up to this shows a spike in interest on January 11. The surge in curiosity coincided with a significant development in the cryptocurrency industry. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) the previous day. The approval generated considerable excitement and discussion within the cryptocurrency community and beyond. As a result, there was a marked increase in public interest in Bitcoin , as reflected in the Google Trends data. For me google trends = retail interest  So retail got in post #Bitcoin  ETF approval, market fleeced them during the first two trading days.  They are now nowhere to be seen. pic.twitter.com/z990f2jMVc  — James Van Straten (@jvs_btc) January 16, 2024   After the initial excitement, the focus within the Bitcoin community and among potential investors is now shifting towards the anticipated Bitcoin reward halving. Zoom out and see what happened the last two halvings, pic.twitter.com/SMXm96TaLf  — Bastiat (@Bastiat677637) January 16, 2024   This event, a routine occurrence in the Bitcoin blockchain protocol that reduces the reward for mining new blocks, has historically influenced Bitcoin’s market value and investor interest. As such, this upcoming halving is drawing attention. Stakeholders are now speculating on the halving’s potential impact on BTC‘s value and the broader market dynamics. In the year leading up to the week of January 15 to 21 2023,  Google Trends data shows a rise in the popularity of the search term “Bitcoin.” According to Google Trends, which rates search interest from 1 to 100, the term had a score of 55 during that period. This system is based on the ratio of searches for a specific term to the total volume of searches in a certain time frame and location. A score of 100 represents the highest level of popularity for the term. By the end of March 2023, the score for “Bitcoin” had increased to 65, reflecting a growing curiosity about and engagement with the cryptocurrency. Throughout much of 2023, public interest in the term “Bitcoin” as measured by Google Trends remained relatively subdued. The lowest point  came in the week of October 8th to 14th, with a search interest score of just 35 out of a possible 100. However, following this lull, there was a noticeable uptick in curiosity about Bitcoin, leading to a score of 61 by the end of October. The peak of interest in 2023 occurred in the week of December 3rd to 9th, with the term “Bitcoin” scoring a notable 70 out of 100. Yet, it wasn’t until the second week of January 2024 that the search term for Bitcoin reached an unprecedented level of popularity, achieving a perfect score of 100. A 90-day analysis by Google Trends highlights significant changes in the global search popularity of “Bitcoin.” On January 11, 2024, the term achieved a peak interest score of 100. However, by January 15, this score had dropped sharply to 41. This pattern reflects the initial excitement around the spot Bitcoin ETFs and the subsequent decline in fervor as the buzz around these financial products began to fade. As of the third week of January 2024, El Salvador, where BTC is legal tender, leads the world in searches for “Bitcoin”. Meanwhile, Nigeria, Switzerland, Austria, and the Netherlands are also showing strong interest. The topics and queries related to “Bitcoin” during this period are predominantly centered around ETFs. “Exchange-traded fund” has emerged as a popular related term, along with significant interest in the “U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.” Other notable topics include cryptocurrencies like “Solana” and “Tether,” as well “Bitcoin Dominance.” Google Trends recorded a peak score of 55 out of 100 for ""bitcoin"" during Jan. 7-13, 2024. Interest surged on Jan. 11 after the SEC approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. Research attention is now on Bitcoin's upcoming reward halving.#Bitcoin  #BTC  #GoogleTrends  #CryptoNews  — Crypto Multistream (@CryptoMStream) January 17, 2024   Common search queries include terms such as “Bitcoin ETF approval,” “Bitcoin ETFs,” “Bitcoin ETF news,” “Bitcoin ETF approved,” and “ETF Bitcoin.” Additionally, trending topics linked to “Bitcoin” are also focused on financial entities like “Blackrock” and market-related terms such as “Bitcoin price.” This suggests a heightened interest in the investment and market aspects of Bitcoin following recent developments in the cryptocurrency space. As Bitcoin approaches its next major event, the reward halving anticipated in April 2024, Google Trends data showcases a notable spike in interest for the specific query “Bitcoin halving.” This term, reflecting focused attention on the upcoming halving milestone, reached its highest popularity with a score of 100 on January 11, 2024, coinciding with the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. However, the intense interest observed immediately following the ETF approvals has since witnessed a significant decline. The countries showing the most significant interest in the “Bitcoin halving” term were Slovenia, Cyprus, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Austria. Despite this initial surge in queries, by January 15, 2024, search interest for “Bitcoin halving” had fallen to 49. Bitcoin sells off after ETF approval, losing support at $45K and $43K.  Price falls below $42K amid Binance ban in India.  Keep an eye on $40K level for potential bearish turn. #Bitcoin  #ETF  #Binance  #India "" — Flavius Co. 🧌∞S (@flama_co) January 13, 2024   This fluctuation  in search interest underscores the short-term nature of public attention, particularly in the often volatile cryptosphere. While the ETF approvals initially heightened curiosity about Bitcoin’s future, this appears to have fallen as the immediate buzz subsided. The recent surge in search popularity for Bitcoin highlights the cryptocurrency’s expanding influence. This spike in interest is a testament to Bitcoin’s increasingly prominent role in mainstream economic discourse. This attention reflects not just the speculative allure of Bitcoin but also its integration in the future of finance. Bitcoin is going to $500k after the Spot ETF is approval.

The asset’s inherent qualities of being censorship-resistant and decentralized play a significant role in its attractiveness. These features, coupled with its potential as a hedge against traditional financial systems, contribute to its sustained interest. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, only time will unveil the enduring impact and appeal of Bitcoin. Its ability to adapt to changing market dynamics, regulation, and technological changes will be crucial in determining its long-term position in the financial ecosystem."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Grayscale Outflows and Bitcoin Price Dip – Are They Related?,https://www.ccn.com/news/grayscale-etf-gbtc-outflows-related-bitcoin-price/,"
Key Takeaways
 In the 7 days since the first spot Bitcoin ETFs started trading on US securities exchanges, the price of Bitcoin has fallen by around 10%. At the same time, investors have pulled hundreds of millions of dollars from Grayscale’s Bitcoin fund (GBTC) since its conversion to an ETF. On Thursday, January 18, when the flight of capital from GBTC outweighed the combined inflows of all 10 other spot bitcoin ETFs. With so much BTC unleashed on the market, selling pressure from Grayscale’s outflows could be a factor in Bitcoin’s recent price collapse. Since Thursday, January 11, when GBTC investors first got the chance to redeem their shares, Grayscale has transferred thousands of Bitcoins to Coinbase to fund the sudden rush of redemptions. In batches of up to 1,000 BTC, the firm has sent a total of 16,712 BTC worth more than $726 million to the crypto exchange so far, data  from Arkham Intelligence reveals. The ""GBTC dumping send $BTC  to sub 30k"" narrative is a weak one when you actually look at the numbers/data. Yea, $GBTC  has been selling off with consistent net outflows since the launch of the 9 $BTC  ETF's, but the reality is that the inflow to the other 9 ETF's has outweighed… https://t.co/A23oAQEzTh  — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) January 19, 2024   The largest volume of transfers to Coinbase occurred on Wednesday when Grayscale offloaded 11,712 Bitcoins. As news of the transactions spread, the price of Bitcoin dropped sharply, but the dip was followed by a strong rebound. In the long run, however, GBTC redemptions have the potential to drive a more pronounced downtrend. Although significant, transactions related to GBTC redemptions in the last week represent just a small fraction of more than 19.6 million BTC in circulation. They are, therefore, unlikely to be the primary catalyst for the bearish conditions that have characterized the market since last Thursday. Nevertheless, the company still holds over half a million Bitcoins – more than enough to influence the overall market should outflows continue at their current pace.  Atlascap invest said that in the next 1-2 months, the selling pressure of Grayscale GBTC will directly affect the price of Bitcoin. At this outflow rate, the net outflow of Grayscale GBTC should have no more than two months of impact on Bitcoin price fluctuations. JPMorgan… https://t.co/qtAmVGzKJX  — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 19, 2024   Noting that GBTC redemptions have already released thousands of additional Bitcoins on the market, Atlascap Invest predicts  that the selling pressure will directly affect the cryptocurrency’s price in the next 1-2 months. Considering that GBTC’s management fees are significantly higher than those charged by its peers, the recent exodus of capital may be driven by investors who plan to relocate to cheaper alternatives. As such, Atlascap anticipates the negative impact of GBTC redemption pressure lasting no more than 2 months. Long term, the firm predicts that demand from other ETFs will ultimately push the price of Bitcoin up."

Key Takeaways
 When Donald Trump was arrested  in Georgia on racketeering charges last year, his mugshot was plastered on newspaper front pages around the world and immediately became one of the most iconic photographs of any US president. Since then, the image has inspired memes and parodies, been printed on merchandise by Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, and now, immortalized in NFT form as the latest “mugshot edition” of digital trading cards bearing the former president’s likeness. Buyers who acquire 47 NFT will also receive a physical card containing fabric from Trump’s mugshot suit. Those who buy 100 also get one of 200 Trump NFTs minted as Bitcoin Ordinals.  Proponents of inscribing NFT data on Bitcoin often tout the blockchain’s expected longevity as one of the main advantages of Ordinals. Even if Magic Eden, the platform responsible for minting the new Trump Ordinals, ceases all operations, as long as Bitcoin exists, the satoshis on which they are inscribed will endure. 4. Of the 200, only 99 are left to purchase with Crypto (WETH) on https://t.co/vrpHbxyrFG  (And if you’re one of the 101 that already Purchased, You'll get your Ordinal!). — CollectTrumpCards (@CollectTrump) January 18, 2024   Because Bitcoin wasn’t designed to handle data-heavy NFT transactions, minting and transferring Ordinals is expensive when compared to other formats. Like previous editions of Trump NFTs, the main mugshot collection follows a more economically efficient model, with each one minted as an ERC-1155  token on Polygon.  At $99 a piece, the 100 digital trading cards needed to secure a Trump Ordinals NFT will set collectors back nearly $10,000. But despite the hefty price tag, over half the collection had been claimed within hours of going on sale. Although the company behind the digital trading cards, NFT INC, states  that it “is not owned, managed or controlled” by Donald Trump or the Trump Organization, the former president’s endorsement isn’t cheap.  Revenue from the new collection will be channeled to the presidential hopeful’s bank account through a licensing deal  with the Trump-owned CIC Digital. After a previous series of 45,000 NFTs sold out in less than a day, a financial disclosure statement  provided as a requirement of his bid for office shows that Trump generated between $100,000 and $1 million of income from the sales.  In addition to the original sales revenue, the creator of Trump’s NFTs also earns a 10% royalty fee from onward sales on OpenSea. According to CoinGecko, the current floor price  for Trump digital trading cards is 0.29 ETH, or around $720.  The original collection’s daily trading volume peaked at over 200,000 ETH in February 2023. But the mugshot edition of 100,000 NFTs is non-transferable until the end of 2024. "

Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin has overtaken silver  to become the second-largest commodity in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in terms of assets under management (AUM). Bitcoin ETFs reached the milestone within a week of commencing trade. This move suggests a swift and substantial accumulation of investor interest and capital in the cryptocurrency. The recent surge in the Bitcoin ETF market is largely attributed to Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust  converting into an ETF. This move not only established the largest Bitcoin ETF but also enhanced market liquidity. Grayscale now leads spot Bitcoin ETFs with approximately 647,651 BTC, amounting to $27.5 billion AUM .

Silver ETFs currently manage around $11.5 billion in AUM, spread across five funds. Meanwhile, gold continues to dominate, with $96.3 billion AUM distributed across 19 different ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs have been met with a positive response from the market. In a just five days, the combined trading volume of the 11 Bitcoin ETF funds exceeded $12 billion. Analysts attribute this to a mix of strong investor demand and competitive fee structures offered by the ETF issuers. These elements are drawing in investors, contributing to improved market liquidity and stability. Further emphasizing this trend, Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst, pointed out  the performance of Bitcoin ETFs in one-week flow comparisons with all ETFs. Notably, two Bitcoin ETFs ranked in the top five and three in the top 10, competing with well-established ETFs like $VOO and $QQQ. This indicates growing investor interest and confidence in Bitcoin as a viable investment option. Another way to put the bitcoin ETF flows in ETF context (besides showing their #s  relative to past new launches) is how they stack up to ALL ETFs in past 1 week flows.

This was been driven by a mix of factors, including a weaker dollar and speculation about the Federal Reserve’s reluctance to maintain aggressive rate hikes. The US Dollar Index, which measures the dollar’s value against other major currencies, has fallen more than 3% since early October. Additionally, geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, have played a role in boosting gold’s value. The World Gold Council (WGC) has reported strong demand for gold , especially from central banks. In the first nine months of 2023, central banks purchased a record 800 tons, a substantial portion of the total demand. This buying streak is expected to continue for the remainder of the year. China and India are the two biggest gold buyers, accounting for more than half of global demand. As we progress through 2024, both Bitcoin and gold ETFs are witnessing pivotal moments. Bitcoin ETFs are at the forefront of reshaping the cryptocurrency market. Meanwhile, gold ETFs maintain their significant status in traditional investment strategies. The decision between investing in Bitcoin or gold ETFs largely hinges on individual investor preferences and risk tolerance. Gold ETFs offer a more conventional and stable investment, anchored to a tangible commodity. On the other hand, Bitcoin ETFs present an opportunity to engage with a more volatile, yet potentially high-return digital asset. This choice epitomizes the diversified and evolving nature of today’s investment landscape.

This is mainly due to the time it takes to complete purchase settlements . Reflecting the growing interest of investors in these products, the Bitcoin ETFs managed by BlackRock and Fidelity each amassed more than $1 billion in assets under management (AUM) at close of trading on January 18. This information is based on data provided by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. Balchunas also  that the Bitcoin ETFs managed by BlackRock and Fidelity have achieved significant prominence in terms of capital inflows. They are currently ranked fourth and fifth, respectively, for weekly capital inflows among all US ETFs.

2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Why MicroStrategy Stock Dip Offers a Lucrative Bitcoin Play – And It’s Better Than ETFs,https://www.ccn.com/news/microstrategy-stock-bitcoin-play-better-etf/,"
Key Takeaways
 MicroStrategy (MSTR) recently faced a significant downturn, plummeting by 33% from its latest peak. This decline coincided with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for American markets, triggering a broader sell-off in Bitcoin-related stocks. The argument against MicroStrategy lies in the belief that there are superior alternatives for gaining exposure to Bitcoin. This trend isn’t exclusive to MicroStrategy because the new Bitcoin ETFs have led to a widespread decline in most Bitcoin-related stocks. Despite concerns about companies with high multiples, MicroStrategy stands out due to its substantial Bitcoin holdings, making its multiples less relevant. MicroStrategy boasts  the second-largest holding of Bitcoins, approximately 190,000, trailing only Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which owns nearly 650,000 BTC, valued at around $28 billion. Despite neither being a Bitcoin fund nor an ETF, MicroStrategy, a software company with a stable and profitable enterprise, stands out for its financial approach. By converting its cash holdings into Bitcoin and leveraging low percentage debt, it has amassed a significant Bitcoin stockpile now valued at approximately $8.2 billion. Even after a post-ETF approval sell-off, MicroStrategy’s market cap is only around $7.5 billion. This makes it an attractive proxy for Bitcoin. Considering its software business, with projected sales of around $550 million next year, its fair value could be estimated at $11.5 billion, aligning with a Bitcoin value of around $43,000. The Financial Prophet  manager and investor Victor Dergunov said : “While MicroStrategy’s stock should benefit as Bitcoin rises, its current valuation seems disconnected. Following Benjamin Graham’s wisdom – “The market is a voting machine in the short term, but it’s a weighing machine in the long run” – recent spot Bitcoin ETF approvals have led the market to vote “No” for MicroStrategy.”. He added: “This has caused a significant price drop, creating a mispricing opportunity. As the market returns to weighing MicroStrategy’s true value, its share price is expected to be repriced significantly higher, reflecting both its Bitcoin and software enterprise value.” MicroStrategy witnessed a significant 33% decline from its recent peak of around $725 a few weeks ago. This correction was spurred by the stock surging beyond $700. Despite the pullback, MicroStrategy is now notably undervalued, trading below $500. The recent surge in trading volume, among the highest recorded for the stock, suggests that the selling pressure may have been excessive, potentially paving the way for a rebound. Crucial technical indicators, including RSI, CCI, and the full stochastic, indicate that MicroStrategy is entering oversold territory. This alignment of oversold technical conditions with a fundamentally undervalued scenario suggests the potential for a strong recovery soon. Dergunov said: “Many may wonder why we choose to hold MicroStrategy instead of the now-available GBTC. While GBTC offers a solid option, its trading on a major exchange reduces the likelihood of pricing discrepancies.” He added: “Given that GBTC should closely mirror Bitcoin’s price, and as one may already own Bitcoin through a cryptocurrency exchange, holding GBTC seems redundant in this case. Instead, I prefer exploring Bitcoin-related opportunities in stocks.” Furthermore, the strategic decision of companies like Tesla, Coinbase, and Marathon Digital Holdings to hold Bitcoin instead of traditional cash on their books aligns with Dergunov’s preference. The Financial Prophet manager said: “MicroStrategy stands out for its bold move, strategically acquiring Bitcoin at an average price of around $31,000. With Bitcoin currently trading around 40% above MicroStrategy’s average purchase price, there’s a promising outlook for further appreciation.” I'm going to push back on Bill Miller IV's pitch that ""MSTR is better than the ETF""https://t.co/xwYPD0Ij9N  Let's examine his arguments one at a time 1. ""MSTR is more liquid than the ETF ""It's the largest owner of Bitcoin in the world"". This is not true GBTC is 3 times the size… — Fred Krueger (@dotkrueger) January 13, 2024   While the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is a top Bitcoin ETF, MicroStrategy distinguishes itself as an ideal Bitcoin proxy. It offers unique opportunities for trading around market peaks and troughs. Additionally, the elevated option premiums on MicroStrategy make it an excellent candidate for the covered call dividend (CCD) strategy. Dergunov said: “By valuing MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin stockpile at approximately $8.2 billion, considering Bitcoin at $43,000, and projecting the software business to generate around $550 million in sales by 2025, we arrive at a fair value of approximately $11.5 billion. If Bitcoin reaches $50,000, MicroStrategy’s potential worth could be nearly $12.8 billion. Accounting for long-term debt of $2.2 billion brings the current valuation to $9.3 billion, with a potential valuation of $10.6 billion if Bitcoin hits $50,000,” With Bitcoin hovering around $50,000, MicroStrategy’s potential valuation stands at approximately $10.6 billion, while its current market cap is only around $7.5 billion. Presently valued at $9.3 billion, MicroStrategy’s market cap would need to surge by 24% to align with its fair value. This suggests that, with Bitcoin around $43,000, a reasonable target for MicroStrategy’s stock is approximately $600. Considering a Bitcoin price of $50,000, MicroStrategy’s market cap should theoretically increase by 40%. This would imply a target stock price of $680. Exploring further, if Bitcoin reaches its all-time high of $69,000, MicroStrategy’s market cap could reach around $14.2 billion. This would signal a 90% upside and a stock price target of approximately $920. MicroStrategy $MSTR  co-founder Michael Saylor has been selling shares of the company daily leading up to the 🇺🇸 SEC's approval of the Bitcoin $BTC  ETFs The sales likely netted Saylor more than $20 million. It is the first time he has sold shares in nearly 12 years – Bloomberg pic.twitter.com/B80NUBl2GK  — Evan (@StockMKTNewz) January 12, 2024   In the event of a new Bitcoin all-time high at $75,000, MicroStrategy’s market cap may reach approximately $15.4 billion, presenting a 105% upside. This dynamic suggests a stock price range of $920 to $995 for MicroStrategy. Despite the optimistic outlook, MicroStrategy does face significant risks, primarily tied to a decline in Bitcoin (BTC) prices. Any drop in Bitcoin’s value would likely impact MicroStrategy’s stock price. Additionally, the inversion of MicroStrategy’s premium could lead to steeper declines in its stock price compared to Bitcoin. Company-specific challenges, such as revenue and profitability issues, could further contribute to a decline in sentiment and stock price. Investors should carefully assess these and other risks before considering an investment in MicroStrategy."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Will We Find Out Who Satoshi Is? London Court Could Reveal Bitcoin Founder,https://www.ccn.com/news/will-find-out-who-satoshi-london-court-could-reveal-bitcoin-founder/,"A high-stakes legal battle is about to unfold that could reshape the very foundations of Bitcoin (BTC) and reveal the true identity of its mysterious founder.  Australian computer scientist Craig Wright will appear at the High Court in London on February 5 as he fights to prove he is the man behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto—Bitcoin’s enigmatic creator whose creation spawned a multibillion-dollar revolution. However, Wright faces tough opposition  in court from the non-profit Crypto Open Patent Alliance  (COPA). This organization aims to definitively debunk his years-long public assertion that he is Nakamoto. The intricacies of the case have compelled the court to consolidate two separate lawsuits, thrusting the critical question around Nakamoto’s identity firmly into the spotlight. Wright himself has long triggered skepticism within crypto circles since first claiming to be Nakamoto back in 2016, including from industry titans such as Vitalik Buterin , the founder of Ethereum (ETH). His inability to provide conclusive proof of this is what continues to fuel doubts among critics. By taking 26 blockchain developers and companies to court, including heavy-hitter exchange Coinbase, Wright raised the stakes in dramatic fashion.  Wright also alleges copyright over the Bitcoin whitepaper, which first outlined the radical digital currency. He also claims sweeping database rights to its blockchain system. The Australian PhD also does not take kindly to reporters inquiring about his claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto. The author, while writing for another publication, has previously asked Wright for an interview to explain his claims, for which the author was quickly blocked on Twitter (now X). COPA views  its high-profile lawsuit as upholding the wider public interest by seeking to protect Bitcoin’s open-source ethos. Formed to guard cryptocurrencies against restrictive patents, the alliance believes debunking Wright’s identity claim will provide more certainty and safety for the volunteer developers that have spent years meticulously building up Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Wright and COPA’s witnesses will endure six grueling days of cross-examination over his documents, credibility and backstory. Acclaimed experts in digital forensics and cryptocurrencies will be summoned to parse finer technical points. Oral closing submissions are due to take place from March 12 to 15. Wright, who founded the Bitcoin SV (BSV) crypto, surprised the court in December by asserting he recently discovered 97 documents amounting to new supporting evidence on USB drives. He allegedly discovered them  in a drawer at his house on September 15 2023. Wright’s legal team, initially slow to disclose details, faced criticism from the opposing counsel who questioned the authenticity and demanded access to forensic images. Amid allegations of forgery, Wright’s counsel changed and suggested narrower keyword searches for document review.  His counsel then proposed a trial adjournment to incorporate the new evidence, leading to a complex pre-trial debate over the evidence’s validity and trial scheduling. In the end, few observers of the proceedings expect these discoveries to hold much weight."
2024-04-11 14:24:00+00:00,Is Spot Bitcoin ETF A Trap For Naive Investors?,https://www.ccn.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-trap-naive-investors/,"In January 2024, 11 Bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) made their debut on major exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, and Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). This noteworthy success occurred after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reluctantly granted approval following a court mandate, as expressed by its chairman, Gary Gensler. Gensler emphasized the necessity of investor caution, highlighting the speculative and volatile nature of the underlying asset. He underscored the multifaceted use cases of Bitcoin, including but not limited to illicit activities, money laundering, sanctions, and ransomware. Should investors – in particular naive ones – be careful when investing in spot Bitcoin ETFs? Bitcoin’s inherent volatility persisted even on its symbolic journey to maturity, a reality acknowledged by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Fink, often credited, or blamed, for steering cryptocurrency into mainstream acceptance on Wall Street, initiated this process in July 2022. At that time, Fink, overseeing the world’s largest asset management company with $10 trillion under management, publicly recognized Bitcoin as a potential alternative to gold. What makes this narrative intriguing is the unexpected alignment of Fink, a titan of Wall Street, with the early adopters of Bitcoin. Fink has not expounded on the epiphany that led him to embrace cryptocurrency, but the shift occurred. The momentum generated by Fink’s endorsement suggests this development is far from its conclusion. After Bitcoin ETFs approval, Fink also endorsed ETFs for Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. He also expressed his belief in these developments as “stepping stones towards tokenization,” affirming his anticipation the financial landscape will ultimately gravitate towards broader tokenization trends. Analysts and crypto experts believe Fink had a huge role in making Bitcoin “more institutional”, bringing it to the attention of traditional investors. But investors, especially new ones, should consider the risks of investing in a Bitcoin ETF. Thanks to ETFs approval, all kind of investors – even retail and naive ones – can now approach Bitcoin. Investing in an ETF, in fact, doesn’t mean you need to buy Bitcoin. The means it’s much less expensive to put money into this financial instrument. But, despite Fink’s enthusiasm and all the headlines celebrating the SEC’s greenlight, there are some risks for investors. The ETFs were launched to make it easier for small investors to have exposure to cryptocurrency. They were also designed to make them feel more at ease, thanks to the reputation enjoyed by traditional finance companies that focus on Bitcoin. In theory, you can take the plunge, as long as you don’t put sums at stake that you can’t afford to lose. But are small investors able to withstand the very high volatility of Bitcoin? Here are some risks linked to investing in Bitcoin ETFs if you’re not a navigated investor. Another aspect to examine revolves around the supplementary costs linked to Bitcoin ETFs. These financial instruments often have management fees, which, in certain instances, might surpass the expenses associated with directly holding Bitcoin. Despite this, many investors may deem such compromises acceptable, given the enhanced security and peace of mind ETFs can provide within the realm of crypto asset management. It is crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is renowned for its inherent unpredictability. This distinguishes it from more conventional financial markets. ETFs, designed to mirror the price movements of their underlying assets, would, inevitably, mirror this volatility. The nature of the cryptocurrency market introduces the potential for significant changes in the price of a spot Bitcoin ETF. It also adds complexity to the forecasting of its long-term performance. Breaking down the risks and rewards of investing in Bitcoin ETFs. Is it the right choice for you? #RiskManagement  #CryptoETFs  — lucio castro (@tattoo27) January 11, 2024   A further potential drawback is the likelihood of a spot Bitcoin ETF’s price deviating from the actual value of Bitcoin. Market dynamics and administrative intricacies could influence the ETF’s price, independent of Bitcoin’s actual value. This may result in situations of overvaluation or undervaluation compared to BTC. Finally, the introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF could deepen Bitcoin’s connection to legislative dynamics. Adverse regulatory decisions could have adverse effects on the ETF’s value, potentially affecting the overall valuation of Bitcoin. Investors should be aware of this heightened exposure to regulatory risk and carefully factor it into their investment considerations. Several regulators around the world have warned inexpert investors about putting money into a Bitcoin ETF. If Gensler said a law forced him to vote in favor of the ETF, his colleagues across the globe cautioned investors and raised some concerns. In Europe, Consob’s chairman, Paolo Savona, said  digital assets only acquire market value when someone purchases them, typically using legal tender. That, as Keynes pointed out, always carries a debtor upon its creation – whether it be the State, central bank, issuing institution, or depositary banks. Savona asserts that the absence of a debtor for cryptocurrencies legitimizes the stance of monetary authorities. He classified them as non-legal tender, meaning they do not function as a medium for settling payments or debts. However, he also noted the challenge faced by financial authorities and legislators in assimilating cryptocurrencies into the existing institutional framework designed for traditional financial activities. This perspective stands in stark contrast to the outlook championed by Fink, showcasing a divergence in their worldviews. Furthermore, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) , the main regulator of financial markets in Europe, warned investors. Some days before SEC’s approval, ESMA said  it’s necessary to expedite the enforcement of European regulation on crypto-assets (MICA) and promptly designate the competent national authorities. ESMA said: “This proactive approach is imperative to swiftly fortify the safeguards for savers who find themselves increasingly vulnerable to the escalating threat of crypto-related scams.”"

Key Takeaways
 Big money manager Vanguard Group may have shunned spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but it is quietly making a big bet on the cryptocurrency through its investment in MicroStrategy, the enterprise software company that has amassed a large Bitcoin holding. This paradoxical stance highlights the growing debate over Vanguard’s view of Bitcoin as an investment asset. Vanguard’s decision to invest in MicroStrategy signals that it is taking Bitcoin seriously, but its cautious approach to ETFs suggests that it is still grappling with the cryptocurrency’s risks. Vanguard Group’s brokerage division has opted against facilitating trading in ETFs directly tied to Bitcoin. Although the awaited approval of Bitcoin ETFs has sparked heightened demand for these investment instruments, individual firms retain the discretion to determine their participation. This cautious stance is frequently linked to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency asset class, prompting firms like Vanguard to prioritize long-term returns over potential short-term fluctuations.

TODAY, they’re calling existing customers already exposed to bitcoin-related securities (like mining stocks, etc.) to address any questions about the Bitcoin ETFs. That is how you treat customers. #Bitcoin  pic.twitter.com/hS04YO0IvJ  — Neil Jacobs (@NeilJacobs) January 12, 2024   As a result, some Vanguard customers have shifted their investments to Fidelity, seizing the opportunity presented by the latter’s embrace of the new ETFs. In fact, as previously reported by CCN, Yuga Cohler, a senior engineering manager at Coinbase, is among a group of individuals signaling their intent to shift their Roth 401(k) savings from Vanguard to Fidelity. Notably, Fidelity stands out as an issuer of one of the ten recently launched Bitcoin ETFs on January 11, reflecting a more proactive approach in incorporating cryptocurrency products into their investment offerings. What’s intriguing is Vanguard’s paradoxical position. Despite its cautious stance on ETFs and Bitcoin due to perceived risks, it emerges as a significant investor in MicroStrategy. MicroStrategy, led by Michael J. Saylor, focuses extensively on Bitcoin trading. Vanguard Group, as per September 2023 data from Yahoo Finance, held 1,126,980 MSTR shares, securing its position as the second-largest institutional shareholder with an 8.24% ownership stake. MicroStrategy shares also feature in various Vanguard investment funds, including the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, the Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund, the Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund, and the Vanguard Small-Cap Growth Index Fund. Notably, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries have accumulated 189,150 BTC over the past few years, valued at approximately $5.9 billion. The heightened interest in Bitcoin ETFs in 2023 propelled MSTR’s stock price. This led some analysts to dub it as “essentially a leveraged Bitcoin ETF.” Bill Miller IV, Chief Investment Officer of Miller Value Partners, underscored  the significance of these ETFs. He said they are a major stride for institutional capital entering the cryptocurrency domain. While acknowledging their importance, he presented an alternative investment that he believes outshines the benefits of a spot Bitcoin ETF – MicroStrategy (MSTR). According to Miller, MicroStrategy offers distinct advantages over a spot Bitcoin ETF. Notably, it boasts higher liquidity and, as the world’s largest Bitcoin owner, avoids associated fees. Miller emphasized the value of being the foremost holder of a new technological asset, citing long-term potential. Additionally, he said MicroStrategy’s CEO is a further appeal. Sailor is a substantial shareholder with significant personal Bitcoin holdings and a robust technological background,. Discussing MicroStrategy’s unique business model, Miller noted its flexibility to adjust its value by selling shares to purchase Bitcoin. It also buys back shares based on market conditions. This adaptable approach, he argued, benefits ongoing shareholders and contributes long-term value."

Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful, expects the price of bitcoin to go up when the Stablecoin Transparency Act passes, which he believes could be soon after the November midterm elections. #KevinOLeary  #MrWonderful  #bitcoin  #StablecoinTransparencyAct  #elections  pic.twitter.com/wqmYgyCR2L  — HASHMAX (@hashmax_mining) October 17, 2022   This perspective from O’Leary underscores the growing acceptance and interest in Bitcoin among institutional investors, marking a significant shift in the traditional investment landscape towards embracing digital assets. The Shark Tank star also said the approval of a Bitcoin ETF  needs an exchange that fully adheres to SEC regulations. He pointed out that Coinbase, a crypto exchange listed on Nasdaq, does not meet these compliance standards because of its current legal issues with the securities regulator. Additionally, he has stated that U.S. crypto regulations are becoming increasingly stringent. In his opinion, the majority of crypto tokens hold no real value and are likely to become worthless eventually. #Bitcoin   Despite the ETF approval narrative, BTC seems to follow the previous cycle's price action.

This figure included substantial contributions from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and BlackRock Inc., which accounted for half and a quarter of these volumes, respectively. Despite the initial success of these ETFs, O’Leary’s reservations underscore the risks and uncertainties that still surround these investment vehicles. The value of Bitcoin experienced a significant decline  recently, dropping to approximately $42,000, a nearly 10% decrease. This coincided with the commencement of trading for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. Before this, Bitcoin had seen an upward trend, reaching a peak of $46,000 last week and escalating to a two-year high of $49,000  when Bitcoin ETFs started trading in the US. However, the recent trends in Bitcoin’s performance have not aligned with the high expectations of many Bitcoin enthusiasts. Notably, the cryptocurrency did not surpass the $50,000 threshold. Also, the initial excitement surrounding the ETFs has begun to diminish, as observed by crypto research firm Swissblock . Swissblock, in its market report, highlighted a critical question: whether the market is capable of maintaining its upward trajectory amidst these developments. CryptoQuant , another research firm, forecasted last month that Bitcoin’s value could potentially drop to as low as $32,000 following the approval of an ETF. This prediction underscores the volatility and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market, particularly in the context of new financial instruments like Bitcoin ETFs. 2 Scenarios Before Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval and How to Respond Quicktake Post by @MAC_D46035  This post explains how to analyze the Bitcoin price support and resistance using on-chain data of the average unit price of #Bitcoin  holders.

2024-04-19 13:24:00+00:00,Why Spot Bitcoin ETFs Could Be Bad for Crypto,https://www.ccn.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etfs-could-bad-crypto/,"The long-awaited approvals of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the SEC this week is being hailed as a milestone event that will open cryptocurrencies to mainstream investors. But while the newfound accessibility is a boon for short-term prices, these ETFs may undermine the founding principles that make cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC) unique and interesting in the first place. By packaging Bitcoin into a regulated financial product traded on stock exchanges, ETFs effectively turn the cryptocurrency into just another asset class for portfolio diversification. Great for your run-of-the-mill investor, sure. But for those who saw Bitcoin as the future of money, excitement about ETFs is kind of missing the point. Fundamentally, this financialization clashes with Bitcoin’s original purpose as a decentralized digital currency outside the traditional financial system. It concentrates ownership under a few large asset managers (BlackRock etc.) instead of a broad network of distributed users. And it places trust in intermediary institutions over the sovereignty of individuals. The iShares Bitcoin Trust $IBIT  begins trading on @Nasdaq  TODAY 💥, underpinned by @BlackRock 's 20+ years of experience and supported by the same technology and risk management expertise offered to institutional investors: https://t.co/GFqpaInEar . https://t.co/k8T5SqwKlE  — BlackRock_News (@BlackRock_News) January 11, 2024   For anyone familiar with crypto’s ethos of decentralization and disintermediation, this is not part of the master plan. But what’s the problem? ETFs themselves aren’t changing anything about Bitcoin itself. The high ideals of crypto aren’t going anywhere, right? Importantly, while ETFs provide an easier on-ramp for new investors, they also shift the narrative around Bitcoin itself.  Excitement over these new funds is focused almost entirely on the potential for price appreciation, rather than enthusiasm for the technology or ideals behind cryptocurrencies. The innovations around digital wallets, blockchain-based transactions, and self-custody get overshadowed when Bitcoin becomes merely something to trade. And let’s be clear: the excitement around spot Bitcoin ETFs is because of a lack of patience, understanding and buy-in from “normal people” about self-custody. It is because of the alternative that exchange-traded funds look so exciting. No more remembering private keys and seed phrases, just add ETF shares to your brokerage account, and done. This shift threatens to turbocharge a narrative change that has already been underway for several years. As it continued to outperform expectations, Bitcoin went from a revolutionary monetary system into just another speculative asset class. Instead of using Bitcoin as decentralized peer-to-peer cash, most investors will simply buy and sell paper claims on the coins.  The aspects that made Bitcoin unique become abstracted away, as market participants care more about chasing profits than advancing a new financial paradigm.  It’s true that the first application for a spot Bitcoin ETF was made in 2013. If, hypothetically, it had been approved, the ETF would exist in a world less primed to regulate the cryptocurrency (in part, because everyone knew a lot less about it). But, we’re in 2024, and Bitcoin is now a finance story, not a tech one. Perhaps if approval was granted earlier things could have been different. C’est la vie.  Some argue that increased investment inflows will help fund Bitcoin’s development in the long run. But much of that capital will flow towards centralized institutions antithetical to Bitcoin’s ethos. And as volatile price swings draw more speculative manias, the likelihood of overregulation only increases. Perhaps the Bitcoin dream is already on its way to being over. In December, US lawmakers took aim at the decentralization and pseudonymity that has long been a core tenet of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency industry.  For the sake of our national security, crypto firms should have to follow the same anti-money-laundering rules as other financial institutions. And I’ve got a bipartisan bill to make it happen. pic.twitter.com/k1Qz3ylYVz  — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) December 8, 2023   Senator Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Sean Casten introduced legislation in their respective chambers that would subject cryptocurrency entities like wallet providers, miners, and validators to stringent anti-money laundering rules that currently apply to traditional financial institutions. Crypto industry advocates argue that imposing centralized oversight runs counter to cryptocurrencies’ raison d’être, but lawmakers believe tighter regulation is necessary to combat illicit financing and national security threats.  With bipartisan support growing, Congress may soon vote to approve controls that could fundamentally alter the legal and practical reality around digital assets. One thing is fairly certain though, the new holders of ETF shares probably won’t be the ones complaining. Many of them never cared in the first place."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Buying BTC: Which Is Better?,https://www.ccn.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-buying-btc-which-better/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has once again caught the eye of your everyday investor following the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds on January 10. This, understandably, leaves investors wondering if they should invest directly in the digital currency or gain exposure through a the newly-approved ETFs. Both options have unique pros and cons to consider. Bear in mind, the SEC has recently approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs. Although, Bitcoin futures ETFs had already been given the green-light and were available on the market. Buying Bitcoin directly allows you to own the actual cryptocurrency. This gives you full control over your investment and the potential for very high returns if you’re quick off the mark. However, investing in Bitcoin requires setting up a cryptocurrency wallet and account on an exchange, which can be complicated for beginners. Investors will also have to pick between centralized and decentralized exchanges—another decision that requires a little research. A spot Bitcoin ETF provides much easier access to Bitcoin exposure for investors. Investing in a Bitcoin ETF is as straightforward as buying any stock or fund in your brokerage account. However, with an ETF you only own shares of a fund invested in Bitcoin rather than Bitcoin itself. As a still emerging asset, Bitcoin carries higher volatility and security risks compared to a regulated Bitcoin ETF. But with higher risk comes the potential for higher rewards. Direct ownership means capturing all of Bitcoin’s upside compared to an ETF that charges management fees, which can reduce your total returns. On the other hand, Bitcoin ETFs offers protections against fraud or theft that come with buying Bitcoin directly or on an exchange. However, Bitcoin ETFs have counterparty and operational risks related to the fund provider’s ability to manage the product. While these are minor risks, they simply don’t exist with Bitcoin itself. Investing in a Bitcoin ETF over the cryptocurrency itself will be similar to holding Bitcoin itself  in most large jurisdictions. In the US, selling your Bitcoin ETF position triggers a taxable event, either as long-term or short-term capital gains, following the same tax rules as cryptocurrency trades. While buying and holding Bitcoin ETF shares incurs no taxes, selling them after holding for over 12 months subjects you to long-term capital gains tax (0% to 20%), and selling within 12 months incurs short-term capital gains tax (10% to 37%). Please, bear in mind that your tax burden will depend on the jurisdiction in which you pay. One major advantage Bitcoin has over a Bitcoin ETF is that as an asset traded 24/7 globally, offering constant liquidity. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs can only be traded during market hours. So, if you’re looking to minimize losses from a sudden market downturn, perhaps ETFs are not the right investment option for you. However, if you want to buy your ETF shares and forget about them until you want to cash out, an ETF might be the better choice. It will give you exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without having to remember a complicated set of private keys (or risk losing them).  Ultimately, whether a spot Bitcoin ETF or buying Bitcoin directly makes more sense comes down to your personal risk tolerance and investment goals. For suitable investors, owning Bitcoin directly provides higher return potential despite higher risks. More conservative investors may prefer gaining exposure through a regulated Bitcoin ETF.  "

Key Takeaways
 In his latest critique of Bitcoin, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, has reiterated his skepticism  towards the cryptocurrency. The bank chief coupled his concerns with a caution about a possible recession within the year. Dimon said  the appeal of cryptocurrencies lies partly in their anonymous nature and the difficulty in tracing transactions. During an interview with Fox Business Network, Dimon said:  “I’ve always said that Bitcoin doesn’t have value.” He cited  its association with illicit activities such as sex trafficking, tax evasion, money laundering, and terrorism financing, emphasizing that its use extends beyond mere buying and selling. “The actual use cases are sex trafficking, tax avoidance, anti-money laundering, terrorism financing; it’s not just people buying and selling bitcoin. There’s no value if you’re buying and selling Bitcoin.” Jamie Dimon acknowledged  the current state of consumers, but he expressed skepticism about the ‘Goldilocks scenario.’ This refers to the optimism that the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes will effectively curb inflation without hampering economic growth.

He previously labeled it a “hyped-up fraud ” and akin to a “pet rock .” Dimon has also called various crypto tokens “Ponzi schemes” and has advocated for governmental intervention to shut them down. Despite his well-known skepticism towards cryptocurrencies, his firm, JPMorgan Chase, has actively participated in the development of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This is a stark contrast to Dimon’s personal views, which have led him to express his desire to curtail the growth of cryptocurrencies in the past. Jamie Dimon said that you owning Bitcoin should be illegal while working on paperwork to get in on the ETF. Now JPMorgan is admitting the system is broken and will probably use the taxpayer money via the BTFP to buy one Hell of a Bitcoin liferaft.

He noted that, while equity and credit markets are currently indicating a soft landing, buoyed by factors like historically low unemployment, wage growth, strong home prices, and enhanced access to credit, his stance remains guarded regarding the overall economic trajectory.

He specifically mentioned the current geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East as significant risks. According to Dimon, both of these conflicts could have a widespread impact, influencing everything from oil, gas, and food prices to migration patterns and international economic relationships."

Key Takeaways
 Despite the recent US regulatory approval of nearly a dozen Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), many investors are finding these approved ETFs are not readily available for trading. Vanguard Group ‘s brokerage arm has decided not to offer trading in ETFs that invest directly in Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bank of America’s Merrill Edge is still deliberating  over whether to provide this service, as revealed by a source familiar with the situation who requested anonymity. The long-awaited approval of these Bitcoin ETFs has led to a surge in demand for these investment vehicles. However, despite the green light from the United States , it ultimately falls to individual firms to decide whether they wish to offer trading in these Bitcoin-linked products. This hesitance is often attributed to the volatility associated with the cryptocurrency asset class, leading some firms to exercise caution before diving into this market. Vanguard said high volatility would be bad for its generating long-term returns. The company told CCN: “While we continuously evaluate our brokerage offer and evaluate new product entries to the market, spot Bitcoin ETFs will not be available for purchase on the Vanguard platform. We also have no plans to offer Vanguard Bitcoin ETFs or other crypto-related products. Our perspective is that these products do not align with our offer focused on asset classes such as equities, bonds, and cash, which Vanguard views as the building blocks of a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio.” Merrill did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In 2023, among the 14 issuers applying for a spot Bitcoin ETF, Vanguard was notably absent. This absence and their subsequent decisions regarding cryptocurrency products have led some to consider transferring their funds to different platforms. Tony Spencer, who identifies as a Vanguard customer, reported  that a company spokesperson explained Vanguard’s stance on not permitting the purchase of spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to Spencer, the spokesperson stated that such products do not align with Vanguard’s investment philosophy. Wow. It is worse than I thought. I called and the answer I received was ""Currently we aren't allowing those to be purchased as it doesn't fit with Vanguard's investment philosophy."" Me: ""Ok but you let me buy GBTC in the past."" Him: ""Yes I believe you can only sell that now."" — Tony Spencer (@notsleepy) January 11, 2024   Furthermore, Spencer claims Vanguard restricts its investors to only selling the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale’s flagship Bitcoin product. Interestingly, this product has recently been transformed into a spot ETF, adding another dimension to Vanguard’s approach to cryptocurrency investment options. 🚨NEW: @Vanguard_Group , the world’s second largest asset manager behind @BlackRock , is reportedly blocking its customers from buying into the new $BTC  Spot ETFs, saying the products “don’t fit with Vanguard’s investment philosophy.”  Now we’ll start to see how institutional… https://t.co/LmZodeYyad  — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 11, 2024   Yuga Cohler, a senior engineering manager at Coinbase, is one of several individuals who have expressed intentions  to transfer their Roth 401(k) savings from Vanguard to Fidelity.

Fidelity is notably among the issuers of one of the 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs that were launched on January 11, indicating a more proactive approach to including cryptocurrency products in their investment offerings. I have 8 years worth of 401K savings at @Vanguard_Group  from my time as an employee at Google. I will be rolling over these funds to @Fidelity .

James Kostulias, the head of trading services at Schwab, emphasized  the significance of this development in an interview. He highlighted the importance of the validation process for the underlying instrument and the comprehensive regulatory and procedural rigor involved in becoming an ETF. This step is, according to Kostulias, a crucial part of establishing the legitimacy and reliability of these new investment vehicles. According to Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett , Merrill is currently taking a cautious approach towards spot Bitcoin ETFs. The institution is reportedly observing the efficiency of the trading of these ETFs before making a decision on offering the purchase of Bitcoin-related products. 🚨SCOOP: @MerrillLynch  also currently not allowing their customers access to the $BTC  Spot ETFs.

2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Bitcoin ETF Portfolio Allocation Expert View: How Much Should Investors Hold in BTC?,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-etf-portfolio-allocation-how-much-btc/,"
Key Takeaways
 With the introduction of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2021, investors now have a way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to buy and store it directly. However, the question remains: how much should investors allocate to BTC ETFs in their overall portfolios? There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the appropriate allocation will vary depending on individual investor risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. However, some experts shared their tips on how to add spot Bitcoin ETFs to your investment portfolio. The time-tested 60/40 portfolio model, known for its balance between equity growth and bond stability, has historically been a reliable choice for investors. However, emerging data suggests that portfolios incorporating Bitcoin can surpass the performance of their exclusively traditional counterparts. The following chart illustrates how the inclusion of Bitcoin in a conventional portfolio has bolstered returns from February 2012 to December 2023. Tailoring VanEck’s approach  to align with investors’ risk tolerance and investment objectives, experts advocate for the incremental addition of Bitcoin, even in modest percentages such as 0.5%, 1%, and 3%. These seemingly small allocations possess the potential to reshape the dynamics of the conventional 60/40 portfolio significantly. VanEck experts propose  that investors consider replacing a portion of their “Real Assets” allocation with Bitcoin. Noteworthy is Bitcoin’s finite supply of 21 million units and its fixed issuance schedule. This means the number of new bitcoins issued undergoes a halving approximately every four years. These characteristics underscore its role as a store of value assets, positioning it uniquely within the investment landscape. Consensus among experts suggests that allocating no more than 5% of your portfolio to cryptocurrencies is a prudent strategy. According  to Bruno Ramos de Sousa, Head of Global Expansion at Hashdex , this percentage is “small enough to keep an investor comfortable in periods of high volatility, but also large enough to have a truly positive impact on the portfolio if crypto prices rise.” Some other experts, like Aaron Samsonoff, Chief Strategy Officer and Co-founder of InvestDEFY , permit  higher allocations of up to 20%. Ultimately, the ideal proportion of cryptocurrency in your portfolio depends on your risk tolerance and personal beliefs regarding the cryptocurrency market. Although participation is optional, the recent wave of regulatory approvals has sent shockwaves through the market. It has promted many of them to consider it a potential game-changer for Bitcoin. Here’s a nuanced perspective from both sides of the debate, as analyzed  by the former Goldman Sachs equity research analyst and internet expert Carl Hazeley: Ratings agency Moody’s said  the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs significance could not be overstated. According to Rajeev Bamra, the senior vice president and head of digital finance at Moody’s Investors Service, this development holds the potential to simplify and secure bitcoin investments for a broader investor base. In effect, this institutionalizes the cryptocurrency and makes it accessible to a wider range of investors. The approval of these ETFs could usher in a new era for Bitcoin. It will transform it into a more mainstream and transparent asset, according  to Moody’s. Bamra believes that this move could lead to a more stable and liquid cryptocurrency market. In turn, this could provide a reliable price discovery mechanism. Bamra said: “The institutionalization of Bitcoin is poised to attract substantial inflows from institutions seeking entry into the cryptocurrency market.” However, this step is not without its challenges and considerations. Bamra highlights the importance of global monetary policy and the need for Bitcoin products to meet regulatory and security standards. Additionally, Moody’s Analytics Senior Director Yiannis Giokas cautions that, despite the potential benefits, traditional investors may face unfamiliar investment risks. This, he says, is due to bitcoin’s inherent price volatility and its fluctuating value compared to stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies. In conclusion, the approval of spot ETFs on Bitcoin marks a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency landscape. However, careful risk assessment and consideration of global economic factors will be crucial in navigating the markets evolving dynamics."

Key Takeaways
 Despite mixed opinions on Wall Street regarding the investment potential of cryptocurrencies, Thursday was a day of vindication for Bitcoin enthusiasts as the first US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) directly investing in the leading digital currency officially commenced trading. This long-awaited launch occurred just a day after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved them. This marked the culmination of a campaign spanning over a decade by the digital asset industry. The group of nearly a dozen funds, which includes offerings from prominent investors like BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, experienced a robust start.  About $4.6 billion worth of shares in the projects were traded in their first day on the market. Some people in the industry view these ETFs as a pivotal step towards wider acceptance among everyday investors and a potential driver for further growth in the cryptocurrency space.

No matter where you look, it’s superseded expectations.” At one moment, Bitcoin experienced a notable surge, briefly surpassing the $49,000 mark, reaching levels not seen since 2021. However, it later fell, settling at around $46,075 as of 9:30 pm EST. Alongside Bitcoin’s fluctuation, other major cryptocurrencies exhibited mixed performance as traders and speculators evaluated the market’s outlook. Thursday’s launch of the new ETFs witnessed some record-setting activities. Notably, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust experienced the largest-ever first-day turnover for an ETF,  with $2.3 billion worth of shares traded. It’s important to note that while the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust debuted as an ETF on this day, it has been operational in a trust structure since 2013. This prior existence gave it a significant advantage in terms of asset size. The trust already managed nearly $27 billion in assets before its transformation into an ETF.

Due to the specific manner in which these funds process and settle trades, the net flows — indicating the total amount of money moving into or out of these products — will likely remain unclear until at least Friday. This lag in data means a more accurate and comprehensive picture of investor behavior and fund performance won’t become available until after the settlement period. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, trading under the ticker IBIT on the Nasdaq, made a significant impact on its debut. The fund nearly reached $1 billion  in trading volume. This accounted for 22% of the total volume across all 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs that were active on Thursday. 🚀📈 The first-ever U.S. spot #Bitcoin  ETF has started trading!

However, it seemed to lose momentum as the day progressed. It’s noteworthy that BlackRock, known for its iShares brand of ETFs, has a history of strong debuts  for its exchange-traded funds. The initial interest and trading volume seen with IBIT align with this. In a surprising turn of events, the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF has been pulled from the list  of newly approved spot Bitcoin funds by the SEC. The regulator’s initial announcement included Hashdex among the approved funds, but a subsequent clarification from Hashdex itself revealed  that the ETF had not received final approval and would not be launching as initially planned.

Options are derivative instruments which many investment professionals use. They offer a means to speculate on future gains or to hedge against potential losses. These financial tools are crucial for sophisticated investment strategies and risk management. And so it begins… Grayscale files for covered call ETF.

This development would mark an advance in the integration of cryptocurrency into conventional financial markets, providing investors with more tools and strategies to engage with digital assets. The approval of options would not only underscore the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance but also potentially increase the liquidity and stability of these markets."
2024-04-19 13:24:00+00:00,Bitcoin Price To Drop As Spot BTC ETF Launches Due to Holders Rotating OUT of Crypto Into Funds?,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-price-drop-etf-launch-holders-rotate/,"The long-awaited arrival of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States has the crypto community buzzing. On January 11, the first day of trading for recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT ) saw significant early interest.  By mid-morning, IBIT had already traded $2 million worth of shares, an impressive volume for an ETF’s opening day, according to senior analyst Eric Balchunas .  While crypto enthusiasts celebrated the ETF milestone, some wondered if the funds might divert investment away from actual Bitcoin (BTC). The thinking is that new crypto investors may opt for the ETF wrapper rather than deal with custodying coins themselves. An unlikely tale for long-term BTC holders who know their way around a crypto wallet, but more plausible for less tech-savvy investors that jumped in more recently. $IBIT  has already traded $2m worth of shares traded. That would be a great first FULL day for a normal ETF let alone at 6am bf mkt, BUT.. this volume is likely BlackRock orchestrated, slowly loading in the BYOA $ it had lined up. Still tho good early sign of big day. pic.twitter.com/IV19iHfqYB  — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 11, 2024   According to VanEck’s Matthew Sigel, ETFs are seeing great interest from those already invested in the coin. In a X space  hosted by The Block, he said: “I heard from a pretty well placed source that Blackrock has more than $2 billion lined up in week one in new incremental flows from existing Bitcoin holders who are adding to positions — I can’t vouch for that. But, you know, that’s what everyone is doing. Just making phone calls and trying to find the folks who can write checks into these products.” According to Ryan Selkis , founder of Messari, the real question isn’t how much inflow to expect into Bitcoin ETFs, but about rotation—the process of selling assets to buy others. What’s important is “how much bitcoin will *rotate* from GBTC to lower fee options in 2024. My bet is that outflows from GBTC match inflows to all new products.” The real question now is not ""how much inflow should we expect to bitcoin ETFs"" – that's $5-10 billion in 2024. Rather, the question is how much bitcoin will *rotate* from GBTC to lower fee options in 2024. My bet is that outflows from GBTC match inflows to all new products. — Ryan Selkis (d/acc)🪳 (@twobitidiot) January 8, 2024   Others believe rotation will be out of Bitcoin, and Bitcoin ETFs, and into Ethereum (ETH) as investors anticipate potential Ether ETFs. BlackRock had previously filed an S-1 form with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its iShares Ethereum Trust. The application has yet to receive approval. Of course, it’s still early days for the Bitcoin ETF market. Some, including Valkyrie co-founder Steven McClurg, predict over $10 billion may flow into the funds by year-end, but trading volumes could fluctuate wildly in the meantime. How asset flows between the ETFs and underlying Bitcoins evolve remains to be seen. So far, the effect on Bitcoin’s price is positive, but not seismic. Since the SEC approved the Bitcoin ETF, the cryptocurrency’s price has seen a modest 4% increase. For now, investors seem keen to get Bitcoin exposure however they can. BlackRock saw strong initial interest in its trust, with nearly $3 million exchanging hands barely six hours into launch day. Rival issuer Grayscale also debuted a Bitcoin fund on January 11th, with their shares rising 2% in pre-market trading. Such an enthusiastic reception bodes well for both the ETF issuers and crypto broadly. While Grayscale, BlackRock and others battle to be the top Bitcoin fund, their success helps validate digital assets to more conservative investors.  That could resonate for years, as the ETFs make Bitcoin more accessible for Wall Street. Crypto holders will be watching closely to see if the funds complement the underlying asset, and the crypto narrative in general, or competes with it."

Key Takeaways
 The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave its approval on Wednesday for the launch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that will track the price of Bitcoin. The introduction of this ETF, which sets a precedent in mainstream investment products, could act as a catalyst, stimulating interest and confidence in other crypto assets. This may lead to the creation of similar ETFs for alternative cryptocurrencies. Cryptos such as XRP, or Solana (SOL), thus expanding the range of investment options in the crypto market. Steve McClurg, the co-founder and chief investment officer of Valkyrie Funds, recently alluded  to the potential approval of Ethereum or XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) following the expected launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs. He said : ” It wouldn’t surprise me if we saw Ripple or Ethereum spot ETFs out there.” This indicates a possibility of expanding the scope of cryptocurrency ETFs beyond Bitcoin in the near future. The excitement in the cryptocurrency market isn’t limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum; other altcoins are also experiencing significant gains. For instance, Cardano (ADA)  has seen a notable increase in its value, rising by 12.48% and currently trading at around $0.58, with its market capitalization reaching $20.5 billion. Technical chart analysis suggests a potential upward trend for Cardano, with predictions indicating that the ADA price could rally to $1 within the year. Also, recent market data trends reveal an intriguing development in the relationship between Dogecoin (DOGE)  and Bitcoin (BTC). Over the past month, following the SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs, there has been a negative flip in the price correlation between DOGE and BTC. Despite this divergence in their correlation, the price of Dogecoin experienced a significant surge. This suggests that while traditionally Dogecoin’s price movements have often mirrored those of Bitcoin, recent events, particularly the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, have led to a distinct shift in this trend, with Dogecoin charting its own course in the market. Looking at other altcoins at the time of writing: Let’s look at some of the altcoin projects that have shown the most significant increases recently: Similarly, other altcoins like Avalanche  (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT)  are also experiencing significant upward movements. Avalanche’s price has increased by 11.47%, while Polkadot has seen a rise of 14.6%. The recent approval of the Bitcoin ETF has been a catalyst in boosting overall confidence in the cryptocurrency market. This landmark decision is seen as a potential gateway to wider acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrencies among a more diverse range of investors. Such a development creates a favorable environment not only for Bitcoin but for other cryptos, too. Think about it like this; Right now there is a limited pool of money in crypto and it is moving between Bitcoin and Altcoins. When Bitcoin goes up it sucks liquidity from Alts and vice versa. We are witnessing that now as Bitcoin is moving up and Alts are bleeding. When the ETF… — Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) January 9, 2024   Bitcoin ETFs is could open the cryptocurrency market to a broader spectrum of investors, potentially enhancing market liquidity.

As a result, investors who are gaining confidence in the crypto market are increasingly exploring altcoins, leading to a diversification of their investment portfolios."
2024-04-19 13:24:00+00:00,Reason Bitcoin ETF Approved Comes Down to Grayscale Court Case and Pure Persistence,https://www.ccn.com/news/reason-bitcoin-etf-approved-comes-down-grayscale-court-case/,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had rejected every single application for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) over the years, dashing hopes that mainstream investors could easily gain exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency through regulated investment vehicles. But Grayscale Investments refused to give up the fight. Through a lengthy court battle, the asset manager finally compelled the reluctant SEC to approve not only the conversion of its bitcoin trust into an ETF, but also a slate of spot bitcoin ETF filings proposed by competitors. On January 10, 2024, SEC Chair Gary Gensler greenlit  11 filings, opening the floodgates to long-awaited crypto ETFs. In his statement, Gensler cited changed circumstances stemming from Grayscale’s legal victory against the SEC in August 2023. The D.C. Court of Appeals ruled the SEC acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” in denying Grayscale’s spot bitcoin ETF application in 2021. The scathing court rebuke forced the SEC to reassess its past rejections. Though Gensler voiced lingering concerns over bitcoin’s volatility and ties to illicit finance, he felt compelled to finally approve spot bitcoin ETFs – including major filings from asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity. In an apparent reference to the Grayscale case, Gensler said: “I have often said that the Commission acts within the law and how the courts interpret the law.”  .@Grayscale  Bitcoin Trust ETF is the first spot #BitcoinETF  to trade in the U.S. For details and disclosures, visit https://t.co/5664gpB8pq  $GBTC  pic.twitter.com/ASdsoaux2d  — Sonnenshein (@Sonnenshein) January 11, 2024   With shares of the rebranded Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) now approved to trade as a spot ETF on NYSE Arca on January 11, mainstream investors will finally have access to a regulated vehicle for crypto exposure, alongside the other spot Bitcoin ETFs approved on January 10. But they largely have Grayscale’s legal perseverance to thank. The asset manager’s dogged court battle resulted in a rare order forcing the SEC’s hand to greenlight not only GBTC’s conversion, but also competitors’ spot bitcoin ETFs. Grayscale refused to stand down until the SEC answered the call. Gensler admitted “circumstances have changed” in light of the Grayscale ruling. He said : “Based on these circumstances and those discussed more fully in the approval order, I feel the most sustainable path forward is to approve the listing and trading of these spot bitcoin ETP shares.” Although, despite Gensler’s grumbling, it appears that the SEC chair was the deciding vote  in a 3-2 ballot of the Commission. For those that missed this detail yesterday in the frenzy. Gensler was the deciding vote to get the #bitcoin  ETF over the line with a 3-2 vote 👀 https://t.co/6FoAnkrpzm  — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 11, 2024   His reluctant approval signals a seismic shift for cryptocurrency’s journey towards mainstream finance. The court decision cornered a long-resistant SEC into opening the floodgates. The road was arduous, but Grayscale and their 10 co-applicants won out. Yet concerns remain on illegal cryptocurrency activity. Gensler warned investors to “remain cautious about risks” while underscoring the SEC did “not approve or endorse bitcoin” itself in greenlighting associated ETF products from Grayscale, BlackRock and others.  To make his point clear, Gensler highlighted Bitcoin’s links to “illicit activity including ransomware , money laundering,  sanction evasion , and terrorist financing .” This could well be a not-so-subtle hint of Gensler’s low opinion of the cryptocurrency. In many ways the years-long ETF saga mirrored bitcoin’s own fledgling path, from shadowy start to mainstream ambition. Grayscale’s hard-fought court victory ultimately opened the door, but it took years of closed SEC doors and denied applications to get there. However for crypto’s early backers vindication is sweet.   "

Key Takeaways
 In a landmark decision, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the first Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), opening up a new chapter in the cryptocurrency landscape. This move is a significant step towards mainstream adoption of the world’s largest digital asset. It has also sparked optimism within the broader crypto sector. Despite some reservations regarding risks associated with ETFs, the SEC greenlit applications from 11 financial institutions. These include BlackRock, Ark Investments, Fidelity, Invesco, and VanEck. This decision paves the way for institutional investors, who have long been hesitant to embrace cryptocurrencies, to gain exposure to Bitcoin through conventional investment vehicles. Issuers have indicated that the majority of these products are slated to start trading on Thursday. This sets the stage for intense competition in the market. #BTC  ETF TRADING START IN 3.5 HOURS! — MMCrypto (@MMCrypto) January 11, 2024   Representing a culmination of ten years of development, these ETFs are a transformative development for Bitcoin. They offer investors a way to gain exposure to the world’s most prominent cryptocurrency without the need to directly possess it. This week, analysts from Standard Chartered projected that the newly approved ETFs could attract between $50 billion to $100 billion in investment in this year alone. Meanwhile, other analysts anticipate that the inflows will amount to around $55 billion over the next five years. As of Thursday afternoon, the market capitalization of Bitcoin exceeded $988 billion, based on data from CoinMarketCap .

ProShares’ Global Investment Strategist Simeon Hyman, who oversees the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) – the largest bitcoin futures ETF launched in October 2021 – observed  that Bitcoin futures ETFs have generally mirrored Bitcoin’s performance quite closely. However, he also said : “The spot market for Bitcoin is still evolving. Unlike the regulated and mature futures market, the spot market’s maturity is yet to be seen. It remains to be seen how effectively they align with each other.” Another point of interest is whether Bitcoin ETFs will be traded at a value higher or lower than their net asset value (NAV). In this context, NAV refers to the value of the bitcoin held by the ETF. There’s a concern that the agreed-upon process for creating and redeeming spot Bitcoin ETFs might lead to these ETFs trading higher than their NAV. Tuesday – Decision time for crypto.

According to Gurbacs, the initial influx of funds into these ETFs is likely to be relatively modest. It might only to only “a few hundred million dollars”. Gurbacs also pointed out much of this capital would be “mostly recycled” money. In my view, people tend to overestimate the initial impact of U.S. Bitcoin ETFs.

While three commissioners voted in favor of the approval, two others dissented. Chair Gary Gensler, Commissioner Hester Peirce, and Commissioner Mark Uyeda voted to approve the ETFs. However, both Peirce and Uyeda expressed concerns about the SEC’s process for approving the applications. Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, on the other hand, issued a sharp dissent from the approval order. The only commissioner who has not yet publicly commented on the approvals is Jaime Lizárraga who also voted against approval.

Gensler acknowledged  the decision as a sustainable path forward, yet he was explicit in his characterization of Bitcoin as a “speculative, volatile asset” involved in various illicit activities like ransomware, money laundering, and terrorist financing. He emphasized that the SEC’s approval of the ETFs does not equate to an endorsement of Bitcoin itself. He said : “While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot Bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse Bitcoin.” JUST IN: 🇺🇸 SEC Chair Gary Gensler issues statement on Spot #Bitcoin  ETF approval.

Gensler’s tenure at the SEC has been marked by significant criticism from various sectors, including congressional members, the crypto industry and its advocates, and even from within the commission. This criticism underscores the ongoing debate and challenges faced in regulating the evolving crypto market. Commissioner Hester Peirce, in her statement , expressed a critical view of the SEC’s prolonged resistance to approving spot Bitcoin ETFs. Peirce highlighted that the agency’s longstanding refusal to greenlight these proposals has caused “many harms.” She said : “We squandered a decade of opportunities to do our job. If we had applied the standard we use for other commodity-based ETPs, we could have approved these products years ago, but we refused to do so until a court called our bluff. And even now our approval comes only begrudgingly, as demonstrated by our continued insistence that these products satisfy a correlation test we have not demanded of prior commodity-based ETPs.” This statement by Hester Peirce is outstanding, both objective and critical. It is a must read. It starkly contrasts with Gensler's begrudging statement, which comes across as if he was forced to approve the ETF, at gunpoint. https://t.co/ctu5TilhSn  — Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) January 11, 2024   Commissioner Mark Uyeda, while voting in favor of the approval order for the spot Bitcoin ETFs, raised “strong concerns” about certain aspects of the approved products. Specifically, Uyeda pointed out  issues with the cash-redemption mechanism employed by these ETFs. He argued that this approach is less efficient compared to in-kind redemption methods used by other types of ETFs. He wrote : “The Approval Order is absent of any analysis as to how the cash-only creation and redemption feature helps to prevent, or perhaps promote, fraud. The removal of in-kind creations and redemptions — coupled with the fact that no other commodity-based ETP prohibits in-kind creations and redemptions — makes one wonder how the Commission reached its conclusion.” Commissioner  Crenshaw expressed  her dissent regarding the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Her concerns centered around issues of fraud and market manipulation within the Bitcoin market. She also voiced broader reservations about Bitcoin itself. Crenshaw’s stance critically addressed the nature of these approvals, reflecting her skepticism about the readiness of Bitcoin-related financial products for the mainstream market and the potential risks they might entail. In her dissent, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cites yesterday's hacking incident as evidence of the sector's immaturity and penchant for manipulation.  A reminder that Gensler was the deciding vote today in approving the ETFs pic.twitter.com/VVZAYaiOrB  — Leo Schwartz (@leomschwartz) January 10, 2024   She said : “I am concerned that there will be confusion about what exactly these products are – (they are not ETFs [exchange-traded funds] registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the ubiquitous products that today are used by millions saving for retirement) – and that investors may infer protections that do not in fact exist.” The SEC’s approval order  for the latest batch of crypto-related financial products has caused some confusion in terminology. The order includes products from firms like Bitwise, Hashdex, Ark Invest, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton, referring to them as “ETFs” in their names. However, the text of the order predominantly describes these products as spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs). This distinction is significant, as the terms ETF and ETP are not always interchangeable. According to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra), an independent regulator for U.S. securities firms, ETFs fall under the broader category of ETPs, but there isn’t a universally accepted single definition for an exchange-traded product.

It’s particularly relevant whether these firms are required to clearly differentiate between these terms in their public communications. Notably, Grayscale referred to its offering as an ETF in a recent press release, while Coinbase, playing a custodial and surveillance-sharing role in various offerings, also used the term ETFs in a blog post to describe the newly approved products. This usage highlights the ongoing ambiguity and the need for clarity in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency financial products sector."

After years of anticipation and regulatory scrutiny, the approved ETFs are poised to begin trading on major American exchanges, potentially triggering a wave of institutional investment and broader market involvement in the digital asset space. The SEC’s approval, announced on January 10, 2024, marks a major step for the cryptocurrency industry, particularly for Bitcoin.

ARK Invest’s entry into the Bitcoin ETF space is notable for its expertise in disruptive technologies. The fund offers regulated exposure to Bitcoin and highlights a low-fee structure to attract investors. Fee: Management fee waived until July 10, 2024, or until assets reach $1 billion, whichever occurs first. Fidelity Investments, a long-established player in the investment sector, has launched the FBTC, providing indirect exposure to Bitcoin. This fund aims to simplify Bitcoin investment, allowing investors to buy and sell the ETF with standard tax reporting. Fidelity is known for its investment platform and its recent ventures into cryptocurrency. Fee: Waived until August 1, 2024. After this date, it will be 25 basis points. Franklin Templeton, a global investment firm, offers the EZBC ETF. This fund underscores Franklin Templeton’s expansion into digital assets, providing investors with a regulated vehicle to gain Bitcoin exposure. Their approach is characterized by a moderate fee structure. Fee: 0.29%, with no disclosed fee waiver details. Invesco  introduced the BTCO ETF in partnership with Galaxy Digital. This collaboration combines Invesco’s ETF experience with Galaxy Digital’s cryptocurrency expertise. The fund offers an initial fee waiver, demonstrating its competitive approach to attracting investment. Fee: Initial six months or first $5 billion in assets fee waiver, then 0.39%. VanEck’s HODL ETF represents another significant entry in the Bitcoin ETF space. VanEck’s approach to Bitcoin investment through this ETF is characterized by a straightforward fee structure and its established reputation in ETF markets. Fee: 0.25%, with no disclosed waiver details. WisdomTree,  has launched the BTCW ETF. This product provides investors with exposure to Bitcoin in a regulated framework. WisdomTree is best known for its wide range of ETF offerings, and the BTCW ETF extends this into the realm of digital assets. Fee: Waiver for initial 6 months or after first $1 billion in assets, followed by a 0.39% fee. Bitwise Asset Management, known for its focus on cryptocurrency index funds, offers the BITB ETF. This fund is notable for its competitive fee structure, which includes a waiver for the initial period. Fee: Waiver for the first six months or the first $1 billion in assets, thereafter a 0.2% fee. BlackRock’s Ishares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) reflects the financial giant’s foray into the Bitcoin ETF market. As a leading player in asset management, BlackRock’s entry is significant. It offers investors a fund with a competitive fee structure and the backing of a well-established investment firm. Fee: 0.25% initially, reduced to 0.2% for the first $5 billion in assets for 12 months. Valkyrie Digital Assets’ BRRR ETF signifies its push into the Bitcoin ETF space. Valkyrie, though relatively new, has made notable strides in digital asset investment products. The BRRR ETF is characterized by its initial fee waiver and subsequent competitive fee rate. Fee: Waiver for the first 3 months, then 0.49%. Hashdex brings the DEFI ETF, known for its higher fee structure compared to other approved ETFs. Hashdex, a pioneer in cryptocurrency investment products, aims to leverage its expertise in digital assets to offer a regulated Bitcoin investment vehicle. Fee: 0.9%, with no waiver details provided. Grayscale Investments, a leader in digital currency investing, offers the GBTC ETF. Grayscale’s move to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF is significant, given its dominant position in cryptocurrency investments. The fund, however, has a higher fee structure compared to its peers. Fee: 1.5%, which is the highest among the listed ETFs. Each of these funds represents a different approach to Bitcoin investment, offering a range of options for investors looking to add digital assets to their portfolios. These ETFs highlight the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investment within regulated financial markets. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have become a staple in the financial world over the last two decades, allowing investors to trade shares representing a collection of assets, like stocks or commodities, on major exchanges. The concept of a spot Bitcoin ETF, tracking the real-time value of the cryptocurrency, had, for a long time been an elusive goal for the crypto industry. The vision was that such an ETF could usher in fresh investment streams from wealth managers and individual traders who might hesitate to purchase digital assets on platforms like Coinbase.

Key Takeaways
 Amid a prevailing sense of optimism in the cryptocurrency sector and Bitcoin (BTC) hitting $47,000 , investors are now deliberating the possibility of diversifying their portfolios to include crypto-related businesses. Financial commentator Jim Cramer has suggested that Bitcoin may be reaching its peak, with a potential “topping out” of its value. Cramer made his comments on a recent episode of CNBC’s “Mad Money”.  JIM CRAMER ALERT🚨🚨🚨: “I think Bitcoin’s topping out.”#Bitcoin 🚀🚀🚀 pic.twitter.com/mt8TwwtPDL  — Swan Media (@Swan) January 9, 2024   He said: “Let’s stop fooling around. You want Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin is topping around, by the way.” Cramer often garners attention as a contrarian indicator due to his history of market predictions. A notable instance of this occurred on January 2, when Cramer commended Bitcoin’s resilience, marking a substantial shift from his previous skepticism.

Adding to the unpredictability, Cramer’s prediction in October  of a significant downturn for Bitcoin was proven incorrect. Instead, the digital currency experienced a rally, surging 150% in 2023. Given Cramer’s track record and the tendency for outcomes to diverge from his predictions, traders are interpreting his recent remarks as a bullish signal. Cramer’s remarks have unexpectedly led to a surge of bullish sentiment about Bitcoin on Twitter, highlighting a trend where his comments often lead to the opposite market reaction. This whole Jim Cramer inverse thing is hilarious 😂 it actually works 💪 — Alex DRocks (@DrocksAlex2) January 9, 2024   Cramer’s latest comments contrast sharply with his statement on January 2.

You ignored these stocks, you’re having a risk.” Cramer focused on the latest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence. He highlighted Nvidia’s introduction of generative AI chips for personal computers at the Consumer Electronics Show. He views these innovations as potentially transformative for both consumer behavior and the broader tech industry. Cramer said: “They’re bringing AI to millions of regular people, not just the hottest in the enterprises.

The company will facilitate Bitcoin transactions through its cryptocurrency exchange subsidiary Mercoin, based in Tokyo. While marketplace prices are listed in yen, customers will have the option to pay with Bitcoin at checkout. According to a recent Nikkei report, Mercoin will convert the Bitcoin to yen before transferring the funds to sellers, so vendors receive payments in fiat currency. The report notes that Mercoin  intends to charge comparable fees to those on credit card and bank transfer purchases made through Mercari’s marketplace. In March 2023, Mercari launched its own cryptocurrency exchange feature within its e-commerce app. This functionality allows Mercari users to purchase Bitcoin using their account balances from Mercari marketplace sales, bank account funds or loyalty points earned on the app. The company has connected its e-commerce platform and Bitcoin exchange service via this closed loop system. Mercari, the renowned Japanese digital flea market platform with over 22 million monthly active users, is set to accept #Bitcoin  payments for its products starting June 2024. 🇯🇵 — Moby Media (@mobymedia) January 8, 2024   As one of the largest consumer-to-consumer online marketplaces in Japan, Mercari attracts over 22 million active monthly users. The Mercari app is widely regarded for its simplicity and convenience in buying and selling. In its latest earnings report, the company posted 2.8 billion yen (approximately $19.4 million) in profit for the third quarter of 2023.  Integrating Bitcoin aligns with Mercari’s focus on digital payments and caters to its significant Japanese user base, many of whom already utilize cryptocurrency. Bitcoin advocates hope that Mercari accepting the cryptocurrency will further boost its mainstream acceptance and reputation. Mercari is not the first Japanese e-commerce company to enter crypto. Rival e-commerce firm Rakuten also operates its own cryptocurrency exchange and non-fungible token (NFT) platform. It launched its crypto exchange service in 2019, and its NFT platform in 2022. In Japan, crypto-assets are lightly regulated, a fact that has helped boost the sector. These integrations look could be improving cryptocurrency adoption, according to new data. A survey  of 30,000 Japanese people aged between 20 and 69 found only 11% of consumers had used a crypto exchange before 2023.  However, 1,728 respondents began using exchanges in 2023, overwhelmingly choosing services from commerce giants Mercari and Rakuten. Of new 2022 crypto traders, 24.7% opted for Mercari’s Bitcoin Trading app and 24.2% picked Rakuten Wallet. This suggests that major firms’ crypto products have the potential to attract crypto newcomers.  "

Key Takeaways
 The cryptocurrency community on Twitter was abuzz with excitement after an anonymous Bitcoin holder transferred  Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $1.2 million, to the Genesis Wallet. This particular wallet address on the Bitcoin network is famously associated with Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic and pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. The transaction, which took place on January 5, involved moving 26.9 Bitcoin, worth approximately $1.17 million at the time. Notably, the sender paid $12 in transaction fees for this transfer. Transferring funds to a wallet address linked to Nakamoto is, generally speaking, irreversible. They have not utilized their Bitcoin holdings since the inception of the cryptocurrency more than 15 years ago. The Genesis Wallet, which originated with Bitcoin’s network and contained an initial 50 Bitcoin from the very first mined block (the Genesis Block), has remained untouched in terms of spending. As of the latest report, this wallet now holds a total of 99.7 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $4.4 million. This recent and unusual transaction of sending a large sum to the Satoshi-linked wallet has ignited speculation on social media. One theory comes from crypto attorney Jeremy Hogan, who suggested  this transfer might be part of a strategy to reveal Nakamoto’s identity, especially in light of the new cryptocurrency tax regulations affecting American residents. Someone just sent Satoshi's genesis wallet $1.2 mil. in BTC. Why?? The only thing that makes any sense is that the sender is flushing Satoshi out. Under the new IRS rules, you have to report any receipt of crypto over $10k. So, Satoshi has to dox himself, OR break the law. pic.twitter.com/S4vBkSdX21  — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) January 7, 2024   Hogan’s theory presumes that Satoshi Nakamoto is American and, therefore, subject to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations. However, this assumption may not be true. If Nakamoto is not based in the United States, the IRS would have no jurisdiction over their actions. This adds another layer of complexity to the speculation and highlights the challenges in making definitive assertions about the identity and motivations of the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. Some commentators have speculated  that Nakamoto might have reemerged. They suggest Bitcoin’s founder could have bought $1.2 million worth of BTC on Binance before transferring it to their original, historically significant, wallet. Either Satoshi woke up, bought 27 bitcoin from Binance, and deposited into their wallet, or someone just burned a million dollars pic.twitter.com/w34kjnAHPJ  — Conor (@jconorgrogan) January 6, 2024   Be it as it may, the saga isn’t over. Last weekend, an anonymous wallet  has conducted a total of 332 transactions. Its holder spent approximately 1.5 BTC, valued around $66,000, to inscribe nearly 9 megabytes of encrypted data  onto the Bitcoin blockchain. BREAKING: Someone just spent >1 BTC to inscribe 8.93 MB of raw binary data into Bitcoin. Can anybody decode it to find out what it is? → https://t.co/PAaKCWVDus  pic.twitter.com/wIpOsgwmhF  — Ord.io (@ord_io) January 6, 2024   The costs of these transactions varied significantly, with the most expensive ones incurring fees amounting to thousands of dollars each. However,  the majority of the transactions were closer to $200. Despite the significant financial outlay for these transactions, the content of the data remains a mystery. It is encrypted and has not yet been decrypted for public viewing or analysis. The account of Ordinals explorer Ord.io on X posted about this significant inscription of encrypted data onto the Bitcoin blockchain. The inscription of encrypted data was facilitated by the Ordinals protocol, a system that assigns data to individual satoshis, the smallest denomination of Bitcoin. Ordinals are often utilized for storing art directly on the blockchain, but they can also be used for various types of data, including encrypted text."

Key Takeaways
 In a recent tweet , Bitcoin advocate and Jan3 CEO Samson Mow advised the cryptocurrency community to hold onto their Bitcoin assets.  This advice comes in the wake of a sudden 7% drop in the value of Bitcoin. The CEO’s cautionary note was specifically in reference to the potential impact of spot Bitcoin ETFs on the market. Samson Mow, the head of Bitcoin tech company Jan3, recently cautioned traders against hastily selling their Bitcoin.  YOU DON’T SELL YOUR #BITCOIN  JUST BECAUSE A PREDICTION ARTICLE SAID ETFS WILL BE DENIED! pic.twitter.com/MzZZXi0mtD  — Samson Mow (@Excellion) January 3, 2024   This warning comes in response to an article published by Matrixport , led by former Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu, which speculated on the potential rejection of Bitcoin spot ETFs by the SEC.  #Bitcoin  dropped $5k on some fake news from a no-name analyst. Imagine what happens when a dozen ETFs are approved and start smash market buying. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) January 5, 2024   The article, influencing the market, predicted  that the SEC would deny applications from major players like BlackRock, Ark Invest, Fidelity, Grayscale, and others, citing various reasons.  Funny to see people blaming a Matrixport report for the dump. BTC perps funding on Sunday was almost 100% annualized. That's very rare, the definition of a very hot market. It's down to 10% now (the baseline). — Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) January 3, 2024   It also forecasted a notable drop in Bitcoin’s value, advising traders to short Bitcoin and favor put options over call options. Mow emphasized the importance of not making hasty decisions based solely on such predictions. The report said : “If there is any denial by the SEC, we could see cascading liquidations as we expect most of the $5.1 billion in additional perpetual long Bitcoin futures to be unwound. We could see Bitcoin prices declining by -20% very quickly and falling back to the $36,000/$38,000 range.” Matrixport’s article, which influenced recent market reactions, suggested  that Bitcoin ETF issuers could meet all the demands set by the regulatory body by the second quarter of this year.  This implies that Bitcoin ETFs might receive approval within this timeframe.  Consequently, Samson Mow is urging the cryptocurrency community to refrain from hastily selling their Bitcoin holdings. His caution stems from the belief that the current possibility of rejection by the regulator should not be a sole determinant for selling, especially in light of the potential for approval in the near future. "

Key Takeaways
 Casey Rodarmor, a developer involved with the Bitcoin Ordinals project, recently made a statement  against the censorship of blockchain transactions.  This stance is particularly significant in relation to Ordinals. In a recent blog post, Rodarmor criticized certain members of the Bitcoin community who advocate for blockchain censorship.  He labeled  these individuals as hypocritical, pointing out the contradiction in their support for censorship while claiming Bitcoin is an “unstoppable” form of money immune to external interference. This debate has sparked discussion within the cryptocurrency community. This reflects the ongoing tension between the ideals of unfettered digital transactions and the practical considerations of content moderation on blockchain platforms.

Love,Caseyhttps://t.co/JhLz54qu0J  — Casey (@rodarmor) December 30, 2023     Rodarmor has raised concerns  about the potential implications of censoring Bitcoin ordinals. He argues any attempt to censor these ordinals could lead to a slippery slope within the Bitcoin ecosystem.  He emphasizes  that due to Bitcoin’s inherent transparency, it’s not feasible to stop people from utilizing this feature. His viewpoint highlights Bitcoins open and transparent nature. He suggests that any efforts to impose restrictions could undermine these core principles, potentially impacting the integrity and freedom associated with the cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin stands as a beacon of transparency and verifiability in times of economic chaos, unlike the opaque and often manipulated traditional financial system. #Bitcoin  pic.twitter.com/8LdgzHgSkC  — ⚡️Street CY₿ER⚡️ (@streetcyber_) December 24, 2023   Rodarmor has expressed his viewpoint on recent criticisms from Bitcoin maximalists about the use of the blockchain for purposes other than payments.  In his blog post , he addresses the discomfort Bitcoin maximalists show towards functionalities that extend beyond simple financial transactions, such as inscribing images and messages on the blockchain. Rodarmor suggests  that maximalists are struggling to accept the reality that the blockchain’s transparency allows for a wide range of uses, some of which they might find frivolous or illegitimate. He believes this stems from a clash between the capabilities of the blockchain and the ideological vision held people who view Bitcoin as a payment mechanism.

He emphasizes the importance of maintaining Bitcoin’s core attribute  as an “uncensorable” platform, placing this principle above other concerns. He underscores the importance of letting the free market guide Bitcoin’s evolution. By resisting over-engineering solutions to every perceived problem and maintaining openness and pragmatism, Rodarmor believes  Bitcoin can transition from a radical idea to a global force for economic freedom. This aligns with the decentralized and open ethos of Bitcoin, suggesting a path forward that relies on market forces rather than imposed limitations.  "

Key Takeaways
 Adam Back, well-known British cryptographer, and creator of the HashCash system used in Bitcoin mining, is sure about a possible coexistence of Bitcoin (BTC) and a digital coin issued by the European Central Bank. He said: “I don’t see much competition between the digital euro and Bitcoin.” Central banks’ digital coins took the headlines recently, in particular after moves from China and the ECB. But it looks like they’re still in an early stage or, to be more precise, in a talking phase. The co-founder and CEO of Blockstream, interviewed at a crypto event  in Lugano, Switzerland, explained: “Satoshi Nakamoto’s crypto asset has above all the nature of digital gold. This, beyond being a medium of exchange, is the relevant characteristic.” And why? Physical gold can even be thought of as a technology, according to him. Back says people need specific techniques to find it, extract it, and process it. The technological elements are present in Bitcoin itself. Which, in this sense, can be considered its replacement in the digital world. Have a look#Bitcoin  #GOLD  #Savings  pic.twitter.com/BwN9DDJAvf  — Max (@themaxhere) December 30, 2023     He said:  “The yellow metal is justified as a financial asset because, precisely, it is scarce. A characteristic which, among other things, implies high costs for its extraction. Well: beyond the fact that Bitcoin is set to have a limited supply, in the digital world everything is scalable and replicable.” So, consequently, it is not possible to “recreate” the element of scarcity. So how can we give a digital asset this condition in the real world? Back has an answer: “Through the high costs, the high energy work, necessary to carry out the validation of transactions. In other words: mining. This is why Bitcoin is digital gold. An asset characterized by scarcity, immutable and authentic thanks to the blockchain, which can also be transferred over long distances and stored at little expense.” Back makes a premise: Bitcoin presupposes in-depth knowledge and awareness of its mechanisms and risks. It is the Cypherpunk approach whereby everyone must be free, but also responsible, for their actions, for how they invest. He said: “Beyond that, I’m still convinced by the nature of Bitcoin – he said -. Upon closer inspection, it is not just about the fact that Bitcoin has a deflationary nature and that, this year, there is a halving. But also the observation that there are many risks on the table: from the wars in Ukraine and Palestine to the unknowns regarding the growth of the global economy. A context where Bitcoin can constitute a good risk hedge.” In this respect, one fact must be underlined: many failed projects and companies were connected to each other. This created a domino effect. Now, however, this has decreased overall and the system has become less risky. Lugano Plan ₿ #Bitcoin   Filmfest panel with Adam Back, Stacy Herbert, Max Keiser and Herman pic.twitter.com/EKs3PB6GjX  — pureDolomites (@pureDolomites) October 22, 2023       Back added that his fear is that “approaches like the one implemented in China will be taken as examples to follow. In that situation, micro-transactions are also checked. The information which, among other things, is then used to create programs such as the social credit score”. He described is as “a dystopian scenario to avoid”. The theme, in general, is that of micro-controls on the operation and use of money. The step towards pervasive systems that limit privacy is a short one. All this must be avoided, according to HashCash founder. Drawing conclusions at this stage is premature, given the intricate nature of reality, according to Back. The dynamics vary in states grappling with a feeble economy and soaring inflation rates, leading to increased adoption. Back said: “Consider Argentina or Venezuela, where the adoption rate is notably high. Conversely, in other regions like Europe or the United States, Bitcoin is more closely tied to price fluctuations, reflecting a cultural influence.” #Bitcoin  capacity on Liquid 🌊 has reached a record high, mirroring the ATH set on Lightning⚡️today, for a combined total of 8,796 BTC on Bitcoin's second layer.

However, in countries such as India, with a rich tradition in precious metals and a historical affinity for mathematics and technology, Bitcoin is more likely to be considered a store of value. The landscape further shifts when considering the newer generations. While young individuals may have never dabbled in stock trading, Bitcoin is a familiar entity. These digital natives effortlessly grasp the notion of something holding value in the digital realm."

Notably, on January 26 last year, the SEC rejected a proposal  to list the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF on Cboe BZX. The reason given for this rejection was the application’s failure to provide adequate safeguards “to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts.” In August, US Court of Appeals Circuit Judge Neomi Rao granted  Grayscale Investments’ request for a review of its application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. This decision also led to the vacating of the SEC’s order that had previously denied Grayscale’s GBTC listing application.

Key Takeaways
 Fifteen years have elapsed since Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic figure behind Bitcoin, unveiled its groundbreaking white paper  to the public. While Nakamoto must have recognized the novelty and innovation of Bitcoin (BTC), it’s doubtful that even they foresaw its role in heralding a new financial era. Now, as Bitcoin celebrates its 15th anniversary, it’s an opportune moment to delve into the reasons behind its global impact, its developmental journey, and its potential future trajectory. Today’s market is flooded with thousands of cryptocurrencies , yet it’s crucial to recognize that Bitcoin’s inception was the cornerstone for most of these digital assets. Its establishment and open-source nature offered a framework for developers to create an array of new cryptocurrencies. Despite the expansion of the cryptocurrency class from a singular entity to thousands, Bitcoin still stands as the frontrunner, leading not just in market value but also in technological advancements.

Will my red line manage to hold up the Bitcoin price? pic.twitter.com/ub3QdsUtYj  — Satoshi Stacker (@StackerSatoshi) January 3, 2024   While newer digital currencies often boast enhanced scalability or advanced security features, the fundamental, straightforward design of Nakamoto’s Bitcoin has demonstrated unmatched robustness, resilience, and functionality. With a flawless security history and the highest degree of decentralization, Bitcoin continues to be the epitome of cryptocurrencies, setting it apart in a league of its own. In response to the Great Recession , Satoshi Nakamoto founded Bitcoin with a variety of goals in mind. A key objective was to create a decentralized payment system free from the need for intermediaries like banks. Although initially conceived for transactional purposes and still capable of serving in this role, Bitcoin has morphed into a favored medium for wealth storage. Bitcoin offers an alternative method for wealth preservation than traditional, fiat, currencies. Its sound monetary policy and limited supply have elevated Nakamoto’s invention to a practical tool for value retention. I am looking forward to the replies on this one.  🤣 pic.twitter.com/xCLQByExpS  — Wall Street Silver (@WallStreetSilv) October 1, 2023   Bitcoin’s journey has seen not just an evolution in its applications but also in its underlying code. While the Bitcoin of today would be recognizable to Nakamoto, it has undergone numerous enhancements through Bitcoin Improvement Proposals  (BIPs) over the past fifteen years. Among these, SegWit  and Taproot are two of the most significant BIPs, having substantially improved Bitcoin’s functionality. The 2017 introduction of SegWit marked a pivotal moment for Bitcoin. This change made transactions both faster and more cost-effective by altering the method of data storage. Following on from this, the Taproot upgrade, sanctioned in 2021, further advanced Bitcoin’s privacy and smart contract functionalities. It achieved this by standardizing the appearance of all transactions on the blockchain, a feature long desired by many. Impressively, despite these enhancements, Bitcoin has preserved its core attributes of decentralization and robust security, simultaneously growing in both capability and efficiency. Bitcoin’s journey has been remarkable. From its early days as a niche cryptocurrency favored by tech aficionados, Bitcoin has evolved remarkably, now handling over 700,000 transactions daily . This surge in popularity has caught the attention of financial titans like BlackRock and Fidelity, who are competing to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Additionally, countries such as El Salvador have adopted Bitcoin as an official currency, showcasing its expanding influence. 2024 may be a year of memecoins as this presale cruises past $2M: Inflows to crypto funds are up big,  Crypto-adjacent stocks outperform all their TradFi counterparts as the Bitcoin ($BTC) Spot ETF is just days away.  Strap in because a bull market… https://t.co/W7flvhQKfx  — COSMICGIRL (@cosmicboostgirl) January 2, 2024   Bitcoin is not only making strides in traditional finance but is also stepping into new territories on the blockchain. In May 2023, Bitcoin found a new application with the launch of Ordinals. This, in effect, allows users to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on its platform. This innovation marks a growing interest in Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (DeFi), a sector currently valued at over $43 billion. Previously, Bitcoin’s involvement in the DeFi space was limited due to its coding constraints. However, with the advent of Ordinals and other technological advancements like Layer-2 blockchains such as Stacks, Bitcoin’s entry into the DeFi realm appears increasingly feasible. This could unlock significant capital in innovative ways, broadening Bitcoin’s utility and market impact. The escalating adoption of Bitcoin by individuals, institutions, and countries worldwide is fueling demand for its fixed supply of 21 million coins. This increasing demand against a limited supply makes it challenging to pinpoint an exact future price for Bitcoin. However, the fundamental principles of supply and demand suggest a likely upward trajectory in Bitcoin’s value.

Day by day, Bitcoin is not only demonstrating its durability but also uncovering new applications and addressing unmet needs within the financial ecosystem. Looking forward, the coming 15 years could be even more transformative. Its fans will be hoping it can continue to forge a path towards further innovation, in line with Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision ."

 Grayscale Investments, a cryptocurrency asset management firm, is reportedly  in discussions with major financial institutions, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, regarding its involvement in Grayscale’s planned Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. According to a source familiar with the situation, these firms could, potentially, serve as authorized participants. Grayscale, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Authorized participants are entities capable of creating and redeeming shares of the fund. They play a vital role in the functioning of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as they are responsible for ensuring that the ETF’s share price accurately reflects the value of the fund’s underlying assets. They also act as a significant source of liquidity for the ETF. In the context of proposed Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock has already appointed JPMorgan  Securities and Jane Street Capital as authorized participants for its Bitcoin ETF. It took over ten years, but we’re finally on the verge of having spot bitcoin ETFs approved in the USA. (Yes, we are.) Many deserve credit for this milestone, but chiefly @Grayscale  and its lawyers, who had the guts to fight this out in court and won. Let’s fight more in 2024. — Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) January 4, 2024     Goldman Sachs has traditionally maintained a neutral position on cryptocurrencies and the wider digital asset sector. Matthew McDermott, Goldman Sachs’ head of digital assets, in a December 27 interview with Fox Business, expressed that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF would significantly contribute to the maturation of the cryptocurrency market and encourage more institutional investments into digital assets. While a spot Bitcoin ETF has yet to receive approval in the United States, ETF analysts are highly optimistic, estimating a 90% chance of approval occurring before January 10. New Research note from me today. We still believe 90% chance by Jan 10 for spot #Bitcoin  ETF approvals. But if it comes earlier we are entering a window where a wave of approval orders for all the current applicants *COULD* occur pic.twitter.com/u6dBva1ytD  — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 8, 2023   At present, 14 asset managers  are aspiring to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF. This would allow institutional investors regulated and direct exposure to Bitcoin within the United States. As previously reported, asset managers often favor the in-kind model for creating and redeeming shares. This is due to its efficiency and reduced tax complexity. However, the SEC has reservations about this approach. The regulatory agency is concerned  that in-kind redemptions could present balance sheet challenges for registered broker-dealers who have to carry out these transactions. The core of the issue lies in the requirement for these entities to physically hold and directly deal with BTC. This introduces potential financial and operational risks. BlackRock has gone cash only. That’s basically a wrap. Debate over. In-kind will have to wait. It’s all about getting ducks in row bf holidays. Good sign. https://t.co/vgocs1aIwS  — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 19, 2023   In a bid to alleviate these concerns, BlackRock presented an alternative in-kind model during a November meeting with the SEC. This revised model was designed to minimize the balance sheet risks associated with handling BTC. Despite BlackRock’s efforts to address the regulatory apprehensions, their proposal did not lead to an immediate resolution or approval from the SEC."
2024-04-15 13:21:00+00:00,Jim Cramer Endorses Bitcoin: Only a Day Later It Drops 9%,https://www.ccn.com/news/jim-cramer-endorses-bitcoin-day-later-drops/,"CNBC’s “Mad Money” host Jim Cramer, once one of Bitcoin’s (BTC) most consistent detractors, has had a drastic change of heart. On Tuesday morning, Cramer praised Bitcoin as a “technological marvel” . He predicted the cryptocurrency is “here to stay”, marking a major pivot from his formerly dismissive views. Cramer specifically cited Bitcoin’s recent ability to maintain prices above $45,000 and keep recovering from crashes as reasons why he now believes the asset has lasting power. He declared: “This thing, you can’t kill it.” His newly bullish perspective comes at a fortuitous time, with Bitcoin widely expected to benefit from the impending approval of a spot-traded ETF in the US. The switch has been head-spinning for dedicated crypto watchers used to Cramer’s biting skepticism. As recently as October 2022, amidst the Sam Bankman-Fried trial, Cramer was advising audiences against buying Bitcoin, insisting “Mr. Bitcoin is about to go down big.” And last year, after China’s crypto mining crackdowns, he revealed he’d sold most of his personal Bitcoin holdings. JUST IN: #Bitcoin  is down almost 7% since Jim Cramer said the Bitcoin bulls were right yesterday. pic.twitter.com/05VoTfZpVp  — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) January 3, 2024   While Cramer says he recognizes Bitcoin’s resilience today, he continues injecting notes of caution. He pointed out many current Bitcoin holders are still short-term speculators, not true adherents. Approving a spot ETF could actually produce a “sell the news” effect, if it causes transient holders to cash out profits. Nonetheless, for the cryptocurrency’s ever-growing tribe of backers, Cramer’s evolving views feel like a watershed moment. They see irony in the fact that Cramer’s blessing could be anything but beneficial, however. Due to a phenomenon crypto investors half-jokingly call the “reverse Cramer effect”. The concept even has its own ETF . The “reverse Cramer effect” suggests that stocks and assets typically underperform or decline after receiving a glowing recommendation from Cramer. The thinking goes that, by the time Cramer gets excited about something, it’s often already overheated and due for profit-taking. Savvy contrarian investors also short or sell anything Cramer is newly bullish on, anticipating other investors’ enthusiasm will shortly fade. As if to prove their point, Bitcoin’s price dropped dramatically just a day after his endorsement. On Wednesday, January 3, the cryptocurrency fell approximately 9% in just an hour, before rebounding 4%. The news was sparked by a report from Matrixport. The crypto services platform said a much-anticipated spot Bitcoin ETF may not be approved before April. At this point saying SEC rejecting it isn’t just going against @JSeyff  and I like it was in the early days, now you basically saying multiple mainstream news reporters w multiple sources on inside of this also have it wrong too. Not saying it’s imposs (again we still ‘only’ at… — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 3, 2024   However, Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, who has been one of the leading voices on a spot Bitcoin ETF approval has raised doubts  about the report.  He said: “[You’re] basically saying multiple mainstream news reporters w multiple sources on inside of this also have it wrong… it overturns a LOT of good intel.”"

Key Takeaways
 The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may potentially decline all proposals for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) due to a lack of a key requisite. This is according to a note a note  from digital asset management firm Matrixport on January 3. This update follows Matrixport’s previous day’s prediction  that Bitcoin could surge to $50,000 before the weekend. The firm now suggests  that the SEC might greenlight these ETF applications by the second quarter of this year. Matrixport attributes the potential rejection of the spot Bitcoin ETF applications by the SEC to the persistently cautious stance of SEC Chair Gary Gensler towards cryptocurrencies. Gensler has frequently highlighted the crypto industry’s non-compliance with regulatory standards. The firm believes  Gensler’s ongoing focus on the need for regulatory compliance in the crypto sector is a strong indicator of a likely disapproval. Such a decision could significantly affect the potential for widespread investment in the cryptocurrency space. Matrix on Target projects a January rejection for Bitcoin Spot ETFs by the SEC, cautioning traders to hedge long exposure. With #SEC  Chair Gensler’s skepticism towards #crypto , a potential -20% #Bitcoin  price drop is anticipated upon #ETF  denial, though a positive end-of-2024… pic.twitter.com/IgaMhBJtiP  — Matrixport (@realMatrixport) January 3, 2024   The report said: “An ETF would certainly enable crypto overall to take off, and based on Gensler’s comments in December 2023, he still sees this industry in need of more stringent compliance.” Matrixport has underscored that the majority of the voting commissioners who would approve such funds are affiliated with the Democratic party, which is generally perceived as having reservations about cryptocurrencies. This view is exemplified by figures like Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren. Her critical approach to the crypto sector has been a source of contention among industry participants. BREAKING 🚨 NEWS ‼️ Bitcoin price dumped 9% in 1 hour on the basis of a report by Matrixport predicting an SEC rejection of ALL Bitcoin ETF applications. pic.twitter.com/xCkzMm0hYB  — Jason A. Williams (@GoingParabolic) January 3, 2024   Furthermore, the firm points out  that regulatory authorities do not seem to have compelling political reasons to approve a spot ETF. Such an approval would effectively endorse Bitcoin as a viable alternative asset. This lack of political will casts doubt on the prospects of a rapid endorsement from these bodies. This cautious outlook from Matrixport contrasts with the more optimistic views prevailing in the market. Several analysts anticipate the regulator’s approval of the pending ETF applications by the week’s end. Matrixport has warned  that Bitcoin’s value might plummet by approximately 20%, potentially dropping to around $36,000, should the SEC decide against the ETF applications. While the @SECGov  is surely unpredictable, it would surprise me if approvals were to happen tomorrow.  From what I understand through conversations I’ve had with issuers, the SEC still has to review all the changes made to the S-1s filed on Thursday/Friday AND make comments on… https://t.co/CnkYdXsbD4  — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 1, 2024   The firm elaborated  that any rejection from the SEC might trigger a series of liquidations, especially considering the $5.1 billion currently tied up in perpetual long Bitcoin futures. Such an event could swiftly reduce Bitcoin’s value, driving it back down to the $36,000 to $38,000 range. In light of this potential scenario, Matrixport is advising  investors to protect their long positions by purchasing put options with a $40,000 strike price for the end of January, or even considering short positions against Bitcoin’s price as a hedge."

Saylor has begun selling off $216 million worth of stock options  in his business intelligence software firm MicroStrategy, with plans to use part of the proceeds to purchase more of the leading cryptocurrency, an asset he has long been a fierce advocate for. The sell-off, disclosed in a filing  with the SEC on January 2nd, will see Saylor liquidating 315,000 shares over the next four months. He first hinted at the stock sale during MicroStrategy’s Q3 earnings call back in November. It was then he told investors he intended to exercise soon-to-expire options dating from 2014. While Saylor emphasized that his equity stake in MicroStrategy remains “significant,” he made clear his ambitions to grow his personal Bitcoin hoard. It’s a continuation of the crypto-focused strategy he has championed at MicroStrategy, which holds over 189,000 BTC worth some $8.5 billion. Under Saylor’s leadership, MicroStrategy has aggressively snapped up Bitcoin when prices declined through 2022. And the software company reaped the rewards during last year’s crypto resurgence. MicroStrategy stock soared 400%, compared to Bitcoin’s 170% gains in 2022. Now with Bitcoin ascending to start 2023, hovering near $17,000 presently, Saylor appears keen to double down. His planned stock sales come just weeks after MicroStrategy plunked down another $615 million to add 14,620 BTC last month.

With the company sitting on almost $8.5 billion in Bitcoin, shareholders have direct exposure to nearly 5% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. Of course, detractors will point to the risks of Saylor’s binary Bitcoin bet. If crypto sentiment sours, MicroStrategy stock could crater just as swiftly as it skyrocketed last year. For now, though, Saylor seems intent on selling the shovels in the latest Bitcoin gold rush rather than chasing the miners. And his moves in early 2023 signal an enduring faith that institutional and retail interest will continue flowing into crypto.

If approved, these ETFs would allow investors easy and regulated exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements within their brokerage accounts for the first time. Rumors are circulating that Gary Gensler’s SEC could approve multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs as early as January 3. In response to growing market excitement, Bitcoin (BTC) broke the psychologically important milestone of $45,000. This represents its highest point since April 2022. Multiple asset managers have applications pending before the SEC, with deadlines for decisions coming up on January 10. Recent amendments submitted to the SEC, combined with joint discussions between regulators and applicants, suggest the SEC may finally be ready to give some ETFs the green light. According to a Reuters report , the SEC plans to inform some applicants of approval in the next few days. This will allow firms time to prepare for launch by January 10, coinciding with a deadline to approve or reject an application from Ark Invest and 21Shares. While the specific applicants likely to get approved remains unclear, more than a dozen major players, like BlackRock and Fidelity, filed updates on December 29th that adhere to SEC feedback. Many industry observers believe approval is imminent, with many believing it is highly likely that the SEC could approve most or all of the applications at once. While the @SECGov  is surely unpredictable, it would surprise me if approvals were to happen tomorrow.

Some analysts argue this could propel the cryptocurrency’s price to new highs. On the other hand, some caution that volatility and increased regulatory burdens could follow. Nonetheless, a spot Bitcoin ETF appears primed to transform the crypto markets. However, rumors are running wild that approvals could come as early as January 3, according to podcaster Scott Melker . Although, according to FOX Business journalist, Eleanor Terrett , this may be too early. She cited the SEC’s recent holiday break and the fact that S-1 forms submitted on Thursday and Friday still have yet to be reviewed. The SEC has rejected more than a dozen Bitcoin ETF applications in recent years, citing concerns around insufficient regulation and the potential for manipulation. However, extensive engagement between regulators and applicants over the past year suggests core issues are largely resolved. Recent discussions have focused largely on operational models for creations, redemptions and custody of Bitcoin. Amendments emphasize cash creation and redemption models rather than in-kind transfers of Bitcoin. Strong surveillance-sharing agreements are also now in place to detect manipulation. With spot ETFs already trading successfully in Canada and Europe, the SEC may finally view the market as mature enough to mitigate risks to US investors. Continued growth of the Bitcoin futures market and stricter overall regulation of the crypto industry likely bolsters the case as well. The approval of even one spot Bitcoin ETF would represent a watershed moment for cryptocurrency adoption and mark the definitive arrival of digital assets into mainstream finance. Additional approvals would likely follow. These could unleash an influx of institutional capital,. This could, in turn, cause a surge in Bitcoin’s price, propelling the cryptocurrency firmly into the financial mainstream.  "

Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song, recognized for his staunch maximalist stance, has voiced doubts about the Ordinals protocol, comparing it to a typical altcoin scam. These remarks by Song emerged as the Bitcoin community engages in increasing conversations regarding the Ordinals protocol. Introduced in early 2023, this protocol has ignited discussions about its effects on the network. Jimmy Song claims that the Ordinals protocol is, effectively, an altcoin scam, subtly capitalizing on the Bitcoin brand to mislead individuals. Altcoin Redux In a way, the ordinals scam is an excellent sign. Altcoins have long been associated with Bitcoin through the moniker of ""crypto"" and have used Bitcoin's good name to scam people through pump and dumps. But as we've seen, this narrative is no longer what it used… — Jimmy Song (송재준) (@jimmysong) January 1, 2024   He suggested that Ordinals, by being built upon the Bitcoin network and embracing the principles of sound money and self-sovereignty usually linked with BTC, has leveraged Bitcoin’s fame to gain a facade of legitimacy and trustworthiness. Song said : “That’s why ordinals and BRC-20 are becoming more popular. There’s little chance of escaping the ‘shitcoin’ moniker by releasing a token on Ethereum or Solana now. The gulf between Bitcoin and altcoins is too wide and crossing that chasm, to scam newbies has become that much harder.” Song maintained that a closer examination of the Ordinals movement uncovers characteristics akin to the “pump and dump” tactics typical of altcoins. These tactics prioritize token trading and speculative activities over furthering Bitcoin’s objective of promoting economic independence. This perspective from Song reflects a larger debate within the Bitcoin community about the network’s future and its applications. While he holds a purist viewpoint, cautioning users against being “misled” by Ordinals and advocating for the community to unmask the protocol as fraudulent, other members of the community perceive potential advantages in Ordinals. Launched in early 2023 at approximately $25, the value of Ordinals tokens sharply dropped to about $5 shortly after. Nevertheless, in the following months, the token has witnessed a recovery, increasing more than tenfold from its lowest point, currently fluctuating between $75 and $80. Michael Saylor, Chairman of MicroStrategy, recently commended  the protocol for its capacity to draw talent and innovation from competing blockchains. This sentiment is echoed by others in the industry.

Since its inception, the protocol has generated significant additional fees, thus revitalizing mining activities and fostering enhanced network security. The ongoing debate  over Ordinals is part of a broader conversation concerning Bitcoin’s future. This debate revolves around core Bitcoin principles, such as its open nature, and the challenge of preserving these values while also embracing new uses and advancements. The 1st Ordiport of 2024!

Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin is on the verge of a major breakout, and there are several reasons to believe that it could reach a price of $55,000 in 2024. One of the main reasons for this optimism is the growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Major companies such as Tesla, Square, and MicroStrategy have all invested heavily in BTC, and this has helped to legitimize the cryptocurrency and attract more mainstream investors. In addition, events like the imminent approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the halving of the king of cryptocurrencies will put a spotlight on Bitcoin. «Digital assets have archived a year full of volatility which ended, however, with prices reaching the highest levels of approximately the last 18 months», said the experts at IG . #Bitcoin  consolidating, altcoins taking a breather at the year's final days. Pretty standard de-risking going into the final days of 2023.  Expecting to rally up from Monday onwards.  Simply buy the dips, it's a bull market. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 28, 2023   They explained that the strong rally of cryptocurrencies in recent months – Bitcoin in particular – is due to a series of factors: the upcoming approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the first ETFs on spot Bitcoin, which may lead both retail and institutional investors to increase their investments; the disinflation process and the next change in the monetary strategies of central banks; the closure of Sam Bankman Fried’s FTX and CZ’s Binance affairs; the Fomo (Fear of Missing Out) sentiment on the crypto sector. The signs that the SEC will approve a spot ETF on Bitcoin in January are “very encouraging”, according to Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest. Cathie Wood is collaborating with 21Shares on two ETF futures products focused on Ethereum and Bitcoin. In an interview with CNBC, Wood predicted not only that the cryptocurrency king will continue its 2023 trend in 2024, but that within five years investors will treat it like an investment in physical gold. There may also come a time when it will be used as fiat money in other emerging economies, she added. El Salvador has already expressed its support for cryptocurrencies. Investors highly await next year, said XTB  analysts, also due to the Bitcoin halving. In practice, every four years the amount of Bitcoins paid to miners as a reward is halved.

Key Takeaways
 The United States government’s Bitcoin holdings have surpassed $8 billion and this number is likely to continue to grow in the coming years. The government has been seizing Bitcoin from criminals and other entities for several years and this activity may continue in 2024. If the government continues to seize Bitcoin at the same rate as it has in recent years, its holdings could reach $10 billion by the end of 2024. This would make the US government one of the largest holders of Bitcoin in the world. The American government has quietly assumed a prominent role in the Bitcoin market. It has accumulated approximately 215,000 BTC through law enforcement seizures since 2020. Data from BanklessTimes.com  shows the government’s Bitcoin holdings now surpass $8 billion, establishing it as one of the largest Bitcoin holders globally. This situation underscores the intricate relationship unfolding between authorities and decentralized digital currencies. A pivotal event unfolded on March 9th, reshaping the landscape of the U.S. government’s cryptocurrency portfolio. Almost 49,000 Bitcoin, associated with legal seizures, underwent a sudden and notable transfer. A convoluted series of transactions resulted in 9,860 BTC being moved to a Coinbase account. This unexpected maneuver generated a buzz, prompting discussions within the cryptocurrency community. The transfer of Bitcoin by the government ignited intense curiosity. What motivations underpinned this substantial yet strategic maneuver? As observers diligently track unfolding developments, broader conversations arise regarding potential impacts. Questions linger: How might market dynamics be influenced? Could there be a tightening of regulations? Could investor optimism be swayed? The government’s recent action in the cryptocurrency space has cast a spotlight on the evolving dynamics between traditional authorities and the burgeoning realm of digital assets. These moves invited speculation and reflection within the broader financial community. The US government’s Bitcoin portfolio is poised to expand, driven by the absence of clear crypto regulations that may prompt authorities to increasingly seize digital assets in the future. It’s active participation in Bitcoin raises questions about the emerging regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Ongoing debates regarding the integration of digital assets into traditional financial systems may intensify. Policymakers grapple with the dual challenge of fostering innovation while safeguarding the government against associated risks. The government’s deepening involvement represents a significant stride towards embracing and integrating crypto into mainstream financial systems. It underscores the parallel evolution of digital assets alongside traditional financial structures. Amidst the complexity, one objective remains evident: the government aims to cultivate a more transparent crypto ecosystem. As the world closely monitors the US government’s Bitcoin holdings, enthusiasts eagerly anticipate how other nations will respond to the shifting dynamics of the digital economy. The recent achievement of the $8 billion milestone shows the convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. It serves as a landmark moment, inviting global observation and contemplation on the evolving intersection of established financial practices and the expanding realm of digital currencies. The Biden administration has expressed a strong desire to regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Also, there are several bills and proposals currently under consideration in Congress. These bills would likely cover a wide range of topics, such as taxation of cryptocurrency, as well as the regulation of crypto exchanges, stablecoins, the use of cryptocurrency in securities offerings. Despite this, nothing has changed so far. The exact timing of the new regulations remains unclear, but their implementation may occur in the next few years. These regulations could have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency industry, but they could also help to legitimize it and make it more attractive to mainstream investors. The main challenge for the crypto sector arises from a divided Congress, grappling to maintain the federal government’s functionality. While House representatives from both sides of the aisle an interest in advancing crypto legislation, especially in regulating U.S. stablecoin issuers, Senate Democrats have largely voiced concerns without taking substantial action. With 2024 being a presidential election year marked by increased political tensions, this does not immediately incentivize them to address potentially controversial legislation. While regulation can be instrumental in bridging TradFi users over to crypto, it’s imperative that opinionmakers and lawmakers in US educate themselves further to bring about smart regulation. Otherwise, we’ll be stuck with at best useless and at worst harmful regulation. Which… — Weiss Crypto (@WeissCrypto) December 19, 2023   The impending departure of Rep. Patrick McHenry adds uncertainty to the near-term outlook for crypto legislation. He will step down at the end of 2024, raising questions about the fate of the bills he has championed. McHenry is a key crypto advocate and Chair of the House Financial Services Committee. In this uncertain legislative landscape, industry leaders are pinning their hopes on the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024. The anticipated decision from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may be a pivotal development, paving the way for highly liquid, regulated funds on exchanges. The sector views this as a potential catalyst, offering a seamless avenue to draw investors off the sidelines and into the crypto space."

Key Takeaways
 BlackRock has revised its filing for a Bitcoin (BTC) spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), making significant adjustments to comply with federal regulators’ requirements on the tracking of Bitcoin’s price by its fund shares. The updated S-1 form , submitted on Monday, December 18, outlines that new shares in the trust will exclusively be created using cash. This approach, as per financial experts, is less tax-efficient compared to the “in-kind” method, where redemptions and creations are based directly on Bitcoin. Following a trend among its competitors, BlackRock has adjusted its strategy for its ETF application, shifting to a cash-creation model for new shares. This move aligns with similar changes made by other ETF applicants, including ARK Invest and 21Shares. Their application, featuring this pivot, is set for a final decision by January 10. The filing  says: “These transactions will take place in exchange for cash. Subject to the In-Kind Regulatory Approval, these transactions may also take place in exchange for bitcoin.” BlackRock, Grayscale, and other ETF applicants have engaged in multiple discussions with staff from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), focusing on the appropriate share redemption model for their proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs. Asset managers typically prefer the in-kind model for share redemptions and creations because it offers a more streamlined process and minimizes tax complexities. However, the SEC has concerns  about this model. The regulatory body believes that in-kind redemptions could pose balance sheet risks for registered broker-dealers who execute these transactions. This is because it requires them to hold and directly interact with BTC. This, in turn, introduces potential financial and operational risks. During a meeting with the SEC in November, BlackRock proposed an alternative in-kind model aimed at mitigating the balance sheet risks. Despite this effort to address regulatory concerns, the proposal did not yield an immediate resolution or acceptance from the SEC. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas : “That’s basically a wrap. Debate over. In-kind will have to wait.”  BlackRock has gone cash only. That’s basically a wrap. Debate over. In-kind will have to wait. It’s all about getting ducks in row bf holidays.

This has prompted the agency to reevaluate relevant applications more openly. Despite this shift, Balchunas anticipates the simultaneous approval of multiple ETF applications in the next month. However, he has expressed doubts about whether the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) would be part of this initial round. Adding to the discussion, James Seyffart, a partner analyst, observed  that WisdomTree’s Bitcoin ETF application still mentions the possibility of in-kind redemptions. This suggests there is a diversity what different ETF applicants are proposing. BlackRock met AGAIN with the SEC today.

2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Bitcoin Fees Rise: Can BTC Save Users Time and Money?,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-fees-rise-btc-save-users-time-money/,"
Key Takeaways
 Since its introduction in 2009, cryptocurrency has gained traction among investors. It has changed from a concept that initially perplexed many to one with which they now have a basic understanding. Despite growing familiarity, the volatile nature of crypto prices, particularly Bitcoin, continues to be a source of confusion and intrigue. Over the weekend, Bitcoin struggled to surpass the $43,000 mark  and faced a significant setback. This rejection led to a sharp decline in its price, resulting in Bitcoin hitting a 5-day low, falling just under $41,000. At the time of writing (December 18 2023), Bitcoin’s trading price  was slightly above $41,018. This represents a decline of 2.12% in the previous 24 hours and 3.9% over the week. This downward trend in Bitcoin’s price coincides with a significant increase in its average transaction fee . This has reached a yearly high of $38.43. The recent spike in fees is closely linked to the rising popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals (ORDI), a form of digital asset inscribed on a satoshi, Bitcoin’s smallest unit. An analysis from a Dune Analytics inscriptions dashboard  by “@dgtl_assets” reveals that miners generated nearly $10 million in transaction fees from Ordinals on Saturday, December 16. The next day, they generated $8.4 million. This surge reflects the increased activity and interest in Ordinals. In turn, this adds a new dimension to Bitcoin’s network usage and fee structure. The surge in transaction fees due to the popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals seems to be leading to congestion in the Bitcoin network. Data  suggests that there are approximately 290,000 unconfirmed transactions as of December 18 2023. Moreover, transactions with fees lower than $1.37 are being deprioritized in the network. Despite the recent bearish trends in Bitcoin’s price, the overall investor sentiment appears to remain positive, as indicated by their hesitancy to sell their holdings. This confidence suggests a belief in the long-term value of Bitcoin. Adding to this perspective, renowned crypto analyst Willy Woo recently shared a tweet  highlighting a key metric that may further illuminate the current state of Bitcoin’s market and investor behavior. #Bitcoin  investors are waiting for higher prices, presently unwilling to sell. SOPR tracks the profit of coins when they sell to new investors. It climbed while price dropped, for this to happen only investors at signficant profit are selling, more recent investors are waiting. pic.twitter.com/Z18W3V36sV  — Willy Woo (@woonomic) December 16, 2023   Woo’s analysis using Bitcoin’s SOPR  (Spent Output Profit Ratio) indicates that BTC investors are anticipating higher prices, hence their reluctance to sell. Supporting this view, key metrics show a balance between Bitcoin’s Supply on Exchanges and Supply outside of Exchanges, indicating no significant selling or buying pressure. Additionally, a decrease in Bitcoin’s velocity , or how quickly it circulates, suggests reduced movement of coins over a set period. Data from CryptoQuant  corroborates this, with BTC’s Binary CDD (Coin Days Destroyed) showing a green signal, indicating long-term holders are moving fewer coins than average, reflecting a tendency to hold. Furthermore, BTC’s daily transactions have also been low in the last 24 hours, reinforcing this trend. The recent surge in Bitcoin transaction fees  highlights a core scalability issue within its framework. While Bitcoin’s strength lies in its decentralized and secure nature, it struggles with efficiency during high transaction volumes. This situation underscores the demand for Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network, which offers faster and more cost-effective transactions, easing the load on the main blockchain. High fees, though a barrier to low-cost transactions, are essential for maintaining the network’s security and preventing abuse, aligning with Bitcoin’s goals of decentralization and affordable node operation. Such challenges and the network’s response to them demonstrate Bitcoin’s capacity for antifragility, further solidifying its role as a transformative global digital currency."

Key Takeaways
 Gary Gensler, the chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), recently indicated  that the regulator might be reconsidering its approach to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs). This statement comes in the wake of a court decision  involving Grayscale, a major player in the cryptocurrency investment space. During the interview on December 14th, Gensler was asked about the numerous pending applications for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). JUST IN: 🇺🇸 SEC Chair Gary Gensler says they are taking a new look at Spot #Bitcoin  ETF's based upon court rulings. pic.twitter.com/mF50rLbrOK  — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) December 14, 2023   He revealed  that the SEC is currently processing “between eight and a dozen filings” for such ETFs. This acknowledgment suggests the SEC is actively evaluating these applications. This could signal a potential shift in its regulatory stance toward spot Bitcoin ETFs. Gensler acknowledged  that the SEC had previously denied several applications for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He then mentioned that the courts have had an input on these denials. Following this, Gensler hinted at a possible shift in the SEC’s approach towards Bitcoin, indicating that the agency might be reconsidering its previous stance on the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. He said: “We’re taking a new look at this based upon those court rulings.” News anchor Sara Eisen inquired if he was alluding to Grayscale. Gensler sidestepped the query, emphasizing that the SEC operates “within the confines of legislation enacted by Congress and judicial interpretations thereof”. While the SEC is currently involved in ongoing cases with Binance and Coinbase, it appears that he could have been talking about Grayscale. Earlier in the year, Grayscale achieved a victory over the regulatory body when a group of judges ruled in favor of the cryptocurrency-oriented asset manager. This decision compelled the SEC to reevaluate Grayscale’s application for converting its Bitcoin trust (GBTC) into an ETF. Grayscale has stated its intention to cooperate closely and promptly with the SEC to secure the necessary regulatory approval.

Additionally, Bitcoin ETF applicants might need to adapt to a cash redemption model. Previously, Gensler also avoided direct responses to questions about the volume of submissions for direct Bitcoin products. He instead shifted the discussion towards recent modifications in the U.S. treasury market, highlighting these as the agency’s current top priorities.

2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Bitcoin and Business: Will More Companies Buy BTC Under New FASB Rules?,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-investing-fasb-businesses/,"The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has introduced new guidance  that will change how companies account for cryptocurrency holdings. The amendments, which will take effect in 2025, require firms to record digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) at fair market value on financial statements instead of just recording impairments. The new guidelines say that they are not just about reflecting crypto economics. They say: “Measuring those assets at fair value will likely reduce cost and complexity associated with applying the current cost-less-impairment accounting model for many entities.”  This shift to a fair value methodology gives businesses a more accurate picture of their crypto investments. Under old standards, companies could only present losses on their books, even if holdings surged in value. Now gains and losses will both be reflected in income statements. The old rules likely made many big investors wary of putting their money into Bitcoin or other digital assets. With the new rules, companies can present a more complete picture of their investments. “[The new rules] will provide investors and other capital allocators with more relevant information that better reflects the underlying economics of certain crypto assets and an entity’s financial position while reducing cost and complexity associated with applying current accounting,” said FASB Chair Richard R. Jones, in a statement . By presenting the fair value, entities can use cryptocurrency similarly to other financial assets used for treasury management or investment purposes. This transparency and recognition of volatility allows firms to have more informed discussions about portfolio construction. A win for both businesses and investors. The changes also simplify the accounting process, moving away from the previous, more complicated system that required regular checks for value loss in certain intangible assets. This makes it easier for firms to include digital assets like Bitcoin in their regular financial reports, instead of treating them as unusual assets that need special treatment.  Though some industries like investment managers already utilized fair value accounting for digital assets, the new guidance creates consistency for crypto accounting across different business types. Taken together, the changes represent a legitimization of cryptocurrency on corporate balance sheets. And there’s plenty of reasons why you’d want them included. Despite last year’s crashes, Bitcoin has been a high-performing asset  in 2023. It broke past $40,000 in early December and has demonstrated a remarkable 140% increase since the start of the year.  This impressive growth not only outshines the Nasdaq 100, Gold, its traditional hard money counterpart, but also eclipses most other blue chip digital assets in the market. Bitcoin’s robust performance mirrors patterns seen in previous cycles, reinforcing its status as a form of digital gold—albeit a very volatile one."

Key Takeaways
 SkyBridge Founder and Managing Partner Anthony Scaramucci has acknowledged  the strong performance of his crypto funds, describing 2023 as a very successful year. Additionally, Scaramucci has expressed his optimistic outlook on Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Scaramucci emphasized the significant global increase in Bitcoin wallets and the growing worldwide acceptance of this digital currency. He believes these factors will play a crucial role in driving Bitcoin’s value to unprecedented levels by 2024. Encouraging individual investors to view Bitcoin as a reliable “store of value” akin to gold, Anthony Scaramucci promoted a strategic allocation of 5%  of one’s portfolio to the cryptocurrency. He said : “I’m making the case that this is a store of value asset. This is effectively digital gold. So Bitcoin’s got a lot of room ahead, but again, small pieces for individual investors is what we recommend.” Starting with a 5% exposure, Scaramucci revealed that his firm’s exposure to Bitcoin has increased as the cryptocurrency’s price grew. Bitcoin has experienced a 145% jump since the beginning of 2023. The recent surge is attributed to factors like the potential regulatory approval of a spot ETF and the scheduled halving in 2024. The anticipated approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs is expected to introduce new demand, contributing to the potential rise of the token to as much as $150,000 by 2025. Additionally, supply-side factors, including the upcoming Bitcoin halving cycle scheduled for April, are anticipated to drive further upside.

He said: “If we’re right, it will impact your portfolio positively, it will offer some lack of correlation to some of the other assets. If you look at monthly returns this year in Bitcoin even when the S&P was not doing well, Bitcoin did well. And it does have over time I think a decoupling effect to the stock and bond market.” The interview took a dramatic turn as Anthony Scaramucci addressed recent comments made by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon regarding cryptocurrencies. Dimon expressed a desire to dismantle the entire crypto industry. Scaramucci, while acknowledging Dimon’s financial acumen, characterized his perspective as short-sighted. Scaramucci emphasized the decentralized nature and global impact of the cryptocurrency network. ""I've always been deeply opposed to crypto, bitcoin, etc. [Senator Warren] pointed out the only true use case for it is criminals,"" says JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. ""If I were the government I'd close it down."" pic.twitter.com/nkEbHR0DOS  — Yahoo Finance (@YahooFinance) December 6, 2023   Scaramucci highlighted the impracticality of governmental bans on cryptocurrencies. He used China, where significant Bitcoin mining and transactions continue despite official restrictions, as an example. He suggested that Dimon’s traditional financial background might be influencing his stringent stance on digital assets. Scaramucci speculated that Jamie Dimon might reconsider his perspective on digital assets as the regulatory environment becomes more favorable. He questioned JPMorgan’s involvement with digital assets, including its research into Bitcoin and the development of the JPMorgan Coin, leaving the door open for potential shifts in their stance. Scaramucci took a proactive stance, appealing to Senator Elizabeth Warren to deepen her understanding of Bitcoin. He highlighted Bitcoin’s potential in assisting the unbanked, a cause championed by Warren. Scaramucci encouraged the Democratic Senator to do her “homework” on Bitcoin."

Key Takeaways
 Adam Back emerged as a pivotal figure in the burgeoning cypherpunk movement in the early 2000s. Back’s work helped shape the landscape of digital cash, proof of work, and anonymity. His creation of Hashcash , a precursor to Bitcoin’s core mechanism, and his contributions to Tor, a privacy-focused browser, highlight his dedication to a future where digital currencies are decentralized, private, and resistant to censorship. Analyst and Editor-in-Chief of Adamant Research, Tuur Demesteer, recently unearthed a tweet  revealing Adam Back’s vision for a decentralized digital currency system twelve years before Bitcoin’s creation.  In a 1997 email to the cypherpunk mailing list, Back proposed a revolutionary concept : a completely independent financial system free from the clutches of traditional institutions. Adam Back in 1997, 12 years before bitcoin:  ""How about this, rather than interface your ecash system with US dollars yourself through credit cards/ debit cards/ cheques / cash, just set up an entirely disconnected system. (…)  The cryptographic requirements for a system such… — Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) December 11, 2023   This vision potentially laid the groundwork for Bitcoin’s key features, including anonymity, decentralization, built-in scarcity, trustlessness, offline functionality, and reusability. Adam Back did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a recent tweet, Back, one of the many developers suspected to be Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, opened up  about his early ideas surrounding digital currency. He acknowledged his contribution to Hashcash. However, Adam Back claims that Hashcash suffered from hyperinflation due to technological advancements. ""My ideas so far are hashcash (where scarcity is related to processing power). However this makes for hyper-inflation because of the rapid increase in CPU power."" (me in 1997) so close, yet so far. might've been the first proposal to using mining; one month after hashcash release — Adam Back (@adam3us) December 12, 2023   Back expressed regret at not envisioning Bitcoin’s solution, stating that he and other cypherpunks, including Hal Finney, Wei Dai, and Nick Szabo, “failed to figure it out.” He attributed this to a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem, leading to limitations like individual difficulty adjustment in Hashcash and human or market-based adjustments in B-money and bit-gold. Back’s insights offer valuable perspective on the early development of digital currency concepts. His tweet highlights the challenges faced by early pioneers and the significant leap forward that Bitcoin represented. Hashcash, initially designed to combat spam , played a crucial role in the evolution of proof-of-work, a fundamental element of Bitcoin. Although Hashcash aimed to limit email spam, its underlying concept of computational work served a distinct purpose in Bitcoin. ""new financial system that I want to present to you that's open to everyone..

Instead, it fuels competition between miners. The miner who successfully generates the first valid proof of work for a Bitcoin block gains the authority to confirm transactions, essentially acting as a decentralized verifier. This competition resembles a lottery, ensuring fairness and giving even small miners a chance to participate. Once a block is mined, the transactions it confirms become increasingly secure. Reversing them requires an attacker to dedicate an immense amount of computational resources, making such attempts impractical and deterring potential manipulation.

You can’t strip PoW “out” of Bitcoin. — nic 🌠 carter (@nic__carter) May 15, 2021   Hashcash in Bitcoin accomplishes a dual purpose: While not the first form of electronic cash, Hashcash’s contribution to proof-of-work was instrumental in creating decentralized and secure digital currences like Bitcoin. Ultimately, Adam Back’s vision for a decentralized financial system accessible to all remains at the heart of the cryptocurrency revolution. He said : “I want everyone to please start learning about this system called #Bitcoin… it was created for this very purpose, so the elites do not have control of the financial system anymore,” serve as a powerful call to action for those seeking an alternative to the traditional financial landscape. As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue to evolve, it will be fascinating to observe whether this vision of a truly democratized financial system can be fully realized."

Key Takeaways
 Since 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador has invested over $120 million  of the country’s funds in purchasing Bitcoin. Now, the country’s “Volcano Bonds” have reportedly obtained regulatory approval  and are set to be launched in early 2024. The Volcano Bond has purportedly secured approval from El Salvador’s Digital Assets Commission, with an expected launch in the first quarter of 2024, as per a statement from The National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) on December 11. 🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨  The Volcano Bond has just received regulatory approval from the Digital Assets Commission (CNAD). We anticipate the bond will be issued during the first quarter of 2024. This is just the beginning for new capital markets on #Bitcoin  in El Salvador. 🇸🇻🌋🚀 — The Bitcoin Office (@bitcoinofficesv) December 12, 2023   President Bukele, seemingly confirmed the news  in a post of his own, saying: “Wen volcano bond?” while also reposting several posts indicating that the bonds will be issued in Q1 2024. Wen volcano bond? 🥺 — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) December 12, 2023   The possibility of El Salvador issuing the Volcano Bonds was initially discussed in November 2021 . On January 11, El Salvador passed legislation establishing the legal framework for the Bitcoin-backed bond. The Volcano Bond aims to address sovereign debt and finance the development of the country’s proposed “Bitcoin City .” ONBTC said that the bond will be issued on the Bitfinex Securities Platform, a blockchain-based equities and bonds trading platform registered in El Salvador. This move marks the commencement of Bitcoin-based capital markets in the country. The bonds are designed to have a 10-year tenure and offer a 6.5% annual return to holders. El Salvador has recently initiated a $1 billion Bitcoin mining project , harnessing 241 megawatts of power. The scheme, conducted in collaboration with Luxor Technology, will be fuelled by energy generated from the Conchagua volcano. We found the Volcano 🌋 Bonds. Will be available soon!!! pic.twitter.com/cUxfhhoCRn  — Bitcoin Beach (@Bitcoinbeach) December 12, 2023   The regulatory approval for El Salvador’s Volcano Bonds arrives approximately 21 months after the country’s former finance minister, Alejandro Zelaya, initially indicated the launch for the Volcano Bond was slated for mid-March 2022. A Bitcoin reserve Bukele acquired with public funds has recently turned profitable amid the ongoing upward trend in Bitcoin prices. Bukele stepped down as president this week to campaign for a controversial second term. According to a website monitoring his Bitcoin portfolio , the 2,764 coins he purchased became more valuable than the initial investment last week. If he were to sell them at the time of writing, he could potentially earn more than $4 million. These figures are based solely on Bukele’s tweets announcing each purchase. The creators of the website remain unknown and were unavailable for comment. El Salvador's #Bitcoin  investments are in the black!

However, in the past week, the price has surged to $44,000 per coin, possibly influenced by anticipated changes in cryptocurrency regulations in the United States. Nevertheless, some economists in El Salvador and elsewhere argue that the moment is not as significant as Mr. Bukele portrays. The $120 million spent by his government to purchase coins represents only a fraction of the public funds used to promote Bitcoin to Salvadorans since the country became the first to adopt it as legal tender alongside the US dollar, its primary currency."

Key Takeaways
 Ever since its inception in 2008, Bitcoin has been a subject of controversy and headlines. Advocates celebrate the cryptocurrency’s introduction as the dawn of a new and fair monetary system. Detractors, on the other hand, highlight its involvement in illicit activities and the lack of legal recognition. Some of the most powerful Bitcoin advocates, such as pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton and crypto experts, recently responded to Wikipedia’s Jimmy Wales, critiquing his bank vs. Bitcoin comparison and fundraising tactics. In a recent post on social media, Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, started a discussion by drawing a comparison  between the dependability of banks and the operational capabilities of Bitcoin. I forgot my bank password and lost my entire net worth. No, actually, that didn't happen, because banks work and bitcoin doesn't. — Jimmy Wales (@jimmy_wales) December 10, 2023   Simultaneously, key figures in the crypto sphere, such as Deaton  and Dogecoin founder Billy Markus , presented personal experiences and perspectives to challenge Wales’s statement. the only thing i know about you is you constantly beg for money like a bum — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) December 11, 2023   As various voices within the crypto community joined the dialogue, the clash of viewpoints illuminated the changing narrative concerning conventional banking, cryptocurrencies, and financial independence. In response, XRP-supporting lawyer John Deaton took a personal stance to challenge Wales’s narrative. I didn’t lose my password but I tried to take $19K out in cash and the bank teller told me she could not give me my 💰 because the 🏦 manager was not in.

However, his efforts faced resistance as the bank teller cited the manager’s absence, leading to significant delays. During this period, Deaton pointed out that Bitcoin generated another 144 blocks. He underscored the potential efficiency and convenience that Bitcoin could offer in such situations. Wales’s post faced criticism from prominent figures in the crypto space. For example, Erik Voorhees, the CEO of leading crypto exchange ShapeShift, took a dig at Wikipedia’s donation model . He suggested that, if the platform had invested in Bitcoin a decade ago, donation pleas might not be necessary today. Wikipedia no longer needs to beg for donations whenever users arrive at the site. No, actually, they still do, because Wikipedia didn't buy any Bitcoin ten years ago when we told you about it. — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) December 11, 2023   Meanwhile, crypto influencer and YouTuber Wendy O defended Bitcoin’s ethos . She claimed banks engage in daily theft while promoting self-accountability and ownership of one’s money—a fundamental principle of Bitcoin. At the same time, market analyst Lyn Alden shared  an anecdote about a Lebanese doctor losing 95% of their net worth due to hyperinflation, cautioning against blind trust in traditional banking systems. Samson Mow, CEO of Bitcoin tech company JAN3, also remarked  that, if Wikipedia had followed his earlier suggestion to invest in Bitcoin, the platform might not need to repeatedly solicit donations. If @Wikipedia  just bought #Bitcoin  a few years ago like I suggested, you wouldn’t have to beg for donations every year in perpetuity. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) December 10, 2023   The clash of perspectives between Wikipedia’s founder and crypto advocates like John Deaton, Billy Markus, and others provides insight into the ongoing discourse surrounding the reliability of traditional banking versus the potential of cryptocurrencies. As the financial landscape evolves, these conversations contribute to shaping the narrative of autonomy, efficiency, and accountability in the world of finance."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Cardano’s Hoskinson on the Crypto Space: “The Industry Doesn’t Need Bitcoin Anymore”,https://www.ccn.com/news/hoskinson-industry-doesnt-need-bitcoin/,"Cardano (ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson says that Bitcoin needs the wider crypto industry more than crypto needs BTC. The Ethereum co-founder told Coin Telegraph: “Bitcoin needs the industry to survive, and sure as hell needs the exchanges and all the other infrastructure because it’s not self sufficient in that dimension.”  While Bitcoin originated the crypto industry over a decade ago, Hoskinson believes it now depends on that industry to remain relevant. The criticism follows recent comments about Bitcoin maximalists, and the SEC’s treatment of the original cryptocurrency. Hoskinson says that the rest of the crypto industry no longer relies on Bitcoin to the same extent. Other networks like Ethereum (ETH) have carved out major roles for themselves, and new innovations in areas like decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens are happening largely outside of Bitcoin. During Abu Dhabi Finance Week, he told Coin Telegraph: “The industry doesn’t need Bitcoin anymore to survive. “It’s nice to have a digital asset like Bitcoin that has that reputation, and it’s digital gold. But remember, at the end of day, it’s a token with a deflationary monetary policy.”  Because of this, he says a different cryptocurrency could potentially displace Bitcoin as the premier digital store of value. Hoskinson was a founding member of both Ethereum and Cardano, two blockchain networks that have changed their original way of working, by introducing things like smart contracts and proof-of-stake. He expressed disappointment that the Bitcoin community did not embrace what he sees as useful upgrades that could help keep it more competitive. Referring to Bitcoin’s “insular” culture, Hoskinson said: “I just don’t see how that survives. It’s a religion. It’s not an ecosystem. He added: “And then you wake up and 98% of the stuff you do is outside of Bitcoin. And you start asking yourself, why do I really care about that? It just becomes another asset.” When it comes to regulation, Hoskinson emphasized the need for an open dialogue between government and industry. He said: “You need to have an open door policy where it’s very easy for the industry as a whole to talk to you and engage with you when there’s ambiguity.”  He also called for regulatory flexibility to accommodate innovation, stating regulators should “regulate not on categories and say it’s a security or commodity, but you look at the specific use cases of the actors, the transactions, geography, and then you say – okay – for this use case, in context, we regulate it this way.” Hoskinson slammed the “bizarre” regulatory approach in the United States that tries to put all cryptocurrencies into a security framework.  He said: “Meanwhile, Ethereum, which did an ICO (initial coin offering) and sold to everybody in the industry, with no KYC or AML. They’re not a security for some reason, we’re not sure why.”  Hoskinson advocated basing policies on how cryptocurrencies are actually used and said compromise is was possible if the government worked with the industry rather than, in his view, attacking it. Whether Bitcoin rises to meet the mounting competition or slowly declines into obscurity remains to be seen. But it clearly faces a more complex and challenging environment than the blank slate Satoshi Nakamoto first introduced in his 2008 whitepaper."

Key Takeaways
 Recently, US Senator Elizabeth Warren claimed crypto was a potential threat. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of investment bank JPMorgan, echoed a similar sentiment, saying he would shut down crypto if he had the authority. In response to the statements made by Warren and Dimon, Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor and whistleblower, criticized Warren for her apparent alignment with banks. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has emerged as a vocal critic of cryptocurrency, recently calling it a “threat” . This shift towards an apparent alignment with the banking sector, previously her target of criticism, has raised eyebrows. During a Senate banking committee hearing, the Massachusetts Senator engaged in discussions with executives from major banks. Notably, she seemed to agree with them on the topic of cryptocurrency regulation. This is a shift from her previous adversarial relationship with the banking industry. Warren said: “I am not usually holding hands with the CEOs of multibillion-dollar banks — But this is a matter of national security.” Supporters of digital currencies strongly disapprove of Warren’s stance. The statements made by the Massachusetts politician have been met with ridicule and criticism, with Edward Snowden accusing her of being “bought and paid for by the banks”. On December 8, 2023, whistleblower and privacy advocate Edward Snowden delivered a pointed critique  of the politician, expressing his sentiments on Twitter. So now we live in a world where a pro-banker Elizabeth Warren sits, stays, and rolls over for the CEO of JP Morgan so long as he feeds her self-serving attacks on his industry's primary competitor. What's next, a pro-war Bernie? — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) December 8, 2023   Snowden, despite voicing concerns about the privacy aspects of cryptocurrencies, is a supporter of the crypto space. He has alluded to considering the purchase of bitcoin (BTC) at specific price levels and has acknowledged using BTC for pseudonymous server payments. Senator Warren did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Warren’s evolving position underscores the intricate dynamics between traditional finance and the emerging realm of digital currencies. While crypto advocates like Snowden persist in challenging her perspectives, the narrative emphasizes the significant influence of cryptocurrency at the intersection of politics, finance, and technology. In the previous month, the Department of Justice announced a $4.3 billion settlement with Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, resolving criminal charges related to money laundering. Additionally, the Treasury has expressed its intention to take action against illicit activities in the crypto space. Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo delivered a stern message to the Blockchain Association , emphasizing the need for the crypto industry to eliminate bad actors or face regulatory intervention. Adeyemo specifically addressed “those within the digital asset industry who believe they are above the law, those that willfully turn a blind eye to the law, and those that promote assets and services that aid criminals, terrorists, and rogue states.” He warned: “We will find you and hold you accountable.” The future of crypto regulation remains uncertain. One thing is clear: the industry can no longer afford to ignore increasing scrutiny from financial watchdogs."

Key Takeaways
 The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extended the timeframe  for its decision on whether or not to approve a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal from asset manager Grayscale. The news, along with other market factors, sent the price of Bitcoin (BTC) tumbling and sparked concerns among its advocates. The delay has been met with disappointment  by many in the cryptocurrency community. They had hoped that the approval of the rule change would lead to increased institutional investment in Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Update: As expected @Grayscale 's Ethereum trust filing just got delayed. It was due by 12/6/23 so this is completely normal. pic.twitter.com/I6LXMZIGGN  — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 5, 2023   Bitcoin has dropped by more than 7% since the SEC’s announcement . This is due to a combination of factors, including the delay in the Grayscale Ethereum Trust’s approval and concerns about the broader economic outlook. The largest cryptocurrency dropped to around $40,000 on December 11, its lowest level in a week. Not long after, its price recovered  and stood at $42,261. It is important to note that the SEC’s decision is not a final ruling. The agency is still accepting public comments on the proposed rule change. It is possible that the agency will ultimately approve the rule change. It is also possible that it will reject it or delay it further. SEC extends Grayscale's ETH ETF review, leaving investors in suspense.  Bureaucracy or bigger forces at play? Timing with FTX collapse raises questions.  Are regulatory issues or doubts on spot ETH ETFs causing the delay? SEC, provide clarity – the industry needs answers. — Abraham.Founder (@McninchF65889) December 6, 2023   The SEC’s decision has also raised concerns about the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. Some fear the agency may be taking a more restrictive approach to cryptocurrencies. This, in turn, could potentially stifle innovation and growth in the industry. Bitcoin’s return to test support caught investors off guard, leading to the liquidation of nearly $100 million  in long positions. This abrupt move served as a wake-up call at the beginning of a week that holds various potential triggers for volatility. Huge liquidation. But fast buy back. Any news for the drop? Can't find anything. — James CryptoG (@Jamyies) December 11, 2023   Bitcoin’s volatility made a swift return after a relatively calm weekend. Contrary to the recent “up only” trading trend, BTC/USD experienced a significant 7% drop. Within hours, it reached a low at $40,660 on Bitstamp . This unexpected downturn resulted in a 5% decline in just a few minutes, adversely affecting leveraged long traders. Data from CoinGlass  indicated the long liquidation amount reached $86 million on December 11, with cross-crypto long liquidations exceeding $300 million for the day. Michaël van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm MN Trading, urged investors , especially those involved in altcoin trading, to remain calm. Markets do have corrections and with #Altcoins , they’ll be deep as markets are illiquid. Don’t stress out. #Bitcoin  momentum is slowly getting towards the end, through which #Ethereum  is easily going to take over next quarter. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 11, 2023   The upcoming week features crucial United States macroeconomic data preceding the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rate policy , adding to potential volatility across various assets, including cryptocurrencies. Following its recent downward mining difficulty adjustment, Bitcoin seems to be cooling off after a period of almost uninterrupted growth. Traders and analysts are anticipating unexpected developments in BTC price action, introducing market uncertainty with just three weeks remaining in the year.

The PPI release coincides with the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rate changes. While the upcoming data releases hold significance, they are unlikely to have a direct impact on policy decisions, as the Fed has already considered multiple other indicators, showing a decline in inflation . The recent exception was the unemployment figures released last week. These revealed that restrictive financial conditions were not having the intended impact on suppressing the labor market."

Key Takeaways
 As crypto markets have turned bullish in the past month and a half, pundits revived a popular game – predicting the Bitcoin price cycle’s next peak. In its contribution to the sport, on Friday, December 7, VanEck published a list of crypto predictions for 2024, speculating that the price of Bitcoin will hit a new all-time high (ATH) in the fourth quarter of the year. In a recent blog post, VanEck analysts said they think the Bitcoin price will reach a new record high on November 9th, 2024, exactly 3 years to the day from its previous ATH.  If correct, their prediction will see BTC climb over 155% from its current price of around $43,600 to over $69,000 in Q4, 2024. The analysts’ bullish outlook is based on a precedent established by previous cycles, when Bitcoin made its most dramatic price gains in the 12 months after each halving. They also argued that political and economic volatility will boost demand for BTC in the year ahead. Noting that 45% of the global population is expected to vote in legislative and presidential elections in 2024, they predicted that “Bitcoin will climb a Presidential-sized wall of worry” in the second half of the year.  Of course, by November 9, the USA will have voted for its next President. Anticipating Donald Trump’s return to the White House, the VanEck blog speculated that such an event could spell the end of the SEC’s hostile treatment of the crypto sector, providing a further boost to the price of Bitcoin. From there, the analysts’ predictions get even more optimistic, forecasting prices of as high as $100,000 by December. What’s more, with several Wall Street experts making similar predictions, VanEck isn’t the only firm anticipating six-figure BTC prices by 2025. While November 2024 will mark 3 years since the crypto market’s last peak, Bitcoin has historically moved in 4-year cycles, with its price continuing to rise for around a year after surpassing the previous ATH.   One method of BTC price prediction uses logarithmic regression models to forecast future prices based on past data.  According to such analyses, if the pattern established in previous years is repeated, the BTC ceiling could rise above $100,000 in 2025, potentially even reaching $190,000–$200,000 by the end of the bull cycle."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,First Bitcoin Yield ETF Filed: YieldMax Aims to Mirror MicroStrategy’s Holdings,https://www.ccn.com/news/first-bitcoin-yield-etf-filed-yieldmax-mirror-microstrategys/,"
Key Takeaways
 Expectations are growing as major asset managers anticipate the approval date for Bitcoin ETF applications, projected to be in 2024. The significance of this timeframe has generated excitement within the cryptocurrency community, considering the approval as a potential major milestone for the industry. In light of these expectations, YieldMax, a dedicated exchange-traded fund (ETF) company, has submitted a filing  to introduce the initial yield-bearing ETF product linked to shares from MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-holding company. As per the filing  submitted to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on December 7, YieldMax has formally requested approval for the launch of its Option Income Strategy ETF, which will be anchored in MicroStrategy shares. The anticipated release date for this ETF is also set for sometime in 2024, the same as anticipated dates for other spot Bitcoin ETFs. Pending approval from the SEC, the ETF will be traded under the ticker symbol “MSTY,” a mere single-letter deviation from MicroStrategy’s existing ticker “MSTR.” Yieldmax’s impending ETF employs a “synthetic covered call ” strategy, combining the purchase of call options with the sale of put options to generate income. The resulting proceeds are then distributed to holders of the MSTY ETF in the form of monthly payouts. Crucially, the ETF will not hold any direct spot positions in MicroStrategy shares, relying solely on the trading of MSTR derivatives to generate income. To mitigate potential losses, the fund restricts its exposure to an upside gain of 15% on the call options each month. Yieldmax emphasizes that the monthly yields from the ETF are not contingent on the growth of MicroStrategy shares, ensuring that investors would continue to receive yields even in the event of a substantial decline in MicroStrategy stock value. Some individuals on social media, particularly on X (formerly Twitter), questioned the rationale  behind choosing to invest in such an ETF rather than directly purchasing the company’s stock or its options. So first we trade the beta of SPX which is BTC, then we trade microstrategy which is the beta of BTC which is the beta of SPX, then we trade yieldmax which is beta of microstrategy which is beta of BTC, which is beta of SPX Beta of beta of beta of beta, got it https://t.co/LrSXfbnP0X  — Marusha (@mattomattik) December 7, 2023   Yield-bearing ETFs  are commonly targeted at conservative investors seeking slightly higher-than-average returns from the most volatile segments of the stock market. Due to the imposed gain limits by fund managers, these ETFs are perceived as a prudent yet potentially more lucrative avenue for generating passive income amidst significant fluctuations in stock prices. YieldMax extends its offerings with a portfolio of 18 comparable ETF products for other prominent tech companies, encompassing entities such as Tesla, Apple, and Nvidia. MicroStrategy shareholders have experienced significant gains in 2023, as the company’s shares have surged by over 290% since January 1, according to TradingView data. On November 30, MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor revealed  that the company had acquired an additional 16,130 BTC at an average price of $36,785 per Bitcoin, totaling approximately $593.3 million. As of November 29, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings amount to around 174,530 BTC, valued at approximately $7.6 billion based on the prevailing market conditions at the time of this publication."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Bitcoin Software Wars: Whirlpool Developer Calls for Boycott of Ocean Mining Pool,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-software-whirlpool-ocean-mining-pool/,"
Key Takeaways
 Launched on October 31, OCEAN is a new non-custodial Bitcoin mining pool designed to protect the network from censorship. At least, that’s what its developer Luke Dashjr claims. But barely a month after its debut, the team behind Samourai Wallet has accused the mining pool of censoring transactions originating from the Whirlpool Bitcoin mixer. With Samourai calling for miners to boycott the platform, the controversy casts doubts over OCEAN’s intention to resist censorship. Samouri’s objection to OCEAN stems from the mining pool’s incorporation of the Bitcoin Knots software, also developed by Dashjr. According to Dashjr , Bitcoin Knots’ latest upgrade, version 25.1, fixes a bug that allows people to “spam the blockchain” by bypassing limits on the amount of data that can be attached to each transaction.  While Dashjr has insisted that his latest code is needed to secure a major network vulnerability, the “bug” it supposedly fixes is also the mechanism on which the entire Bitcoin Ordinals ecosystem is built. We are happy to announce testing of Bitcoin Knots v25.1 has completed successfully, and is now deployed to production. Among other improvements, this upgrade fixes this long-standing vulnerability exploited by modern spammers. As a result, our blocks will now include many more… https://t.co/II3y0B6Pu4  — OCEAN (@ocean_mining) December 6, 2023   For Bitcoin nodes running Knots, the latest upgrade effectively invalidates all Ordinals inscriptions. Dashjr has also stated his intention to extend the changes to future versions of Bitcoin Core. Although not its original intention, since OCEAN implemented Knots v25.1 on Wednesday, December 06, the data limit it imposes has prevented miners from validating Whirlpool transactions.  We can confirm that @ocean_mining  has enacted a policy of censoring Whirlpool coinjoin transactions and BIP47 notification transactions as of Dec 6, 2023 This is a regrettable action by the operators @jack  and @LukeDashjr  and far surpasses any hostile action we have seen before — Samourai Wallet (@SamouraiWallet) December 7, 2023   In an X post asking miners to direct their hash power toward other pools, Samourai said  People should “make it absolutely clear to the pool that you do not agree with their privacy enhancing transaction censorship policy.” For his part, Dashjr blamed  Whirlpool for the issue, implying that the protocol’s higher-than-standard data output was a bug in need of fixing like Ordinals inscriptions. For now, OCEAN doesn’t have anywhere near enough hash power to meaningfully restrict Whirlpool transactions or Ordinals inscriptions. And for most miners, transaction fees from the latter present far too lucrative an opportunity to pass up. However, if Dashjr gets his way and the same restriction is incorporated into future versions of Bitcoin Core, the implications could be much more serious as the software is by far the most popular way to run a Bitcoin node. Of course, both Bitcoin Knots and Bitcoin Core are open-source. Just like OCEAN can choose to not include certain transactions in the blocks it generates, node operators are free to decide whether to relay them or not.  This won't age well. You are going against what Bitcoin stands for. You are using Bitcoin for censorship. The ultimate contradiction. — ₿itcoiner (@BitcoinerDev) December 6, 2023   In the end, the debate centers on disagreements over Bitcoin’s fundamental values.  Purists like Dashjr denounce use cases they perceive to be unnecessarily clogging up the network. Meanwhile, supporters of Ordinals and Whirlpool argue that as long as people are willing to pay for the block space, they should be free to inscribe whatever Bitcoin data they like."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Ordinals Growth in Danger as Bitcoin Bug Fix Could Impact BRC-20 Tokens,https://www.ccn.com/news/ordinals-growth-danger-bitcoin-bug-fix-impact-brc-20-tokens/,"
Key Takeaways
 A potential bug fix in the Bitcoin network could halt the creation of new Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, as they are reportedly causing excessive network congestion by exploiting a vulnerability. Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr raised the issue in a recent Twitter post, stating that inscriptions, the mechanism used by Ordinals and BRC-20 creators to embed data on satoshis, are exploiting a vulnerability in Bitcoin Core to “spam the blockchain.” According to Dashjr, the Bitcoin Core code has allowed users to impose limits on the size of additional data in transactions since 2013. However, by disguising their data as program code, inscriptions are able to circumvent this restriction. This loophole has led to a surge in inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens, resulting in network congestion that could hinder the smooth operation of the Bitcoin network. The proposed bug fix, if implemented, would effectively close this loophole, preventing Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens from being used to exploit the vulnerability. While this would address the network congestion issue, it could also stifle the growth of the Ordinals and BRC-20 ecosystems, raising concerns about the potential impact on innovation and development within the Bitcoin network. PSA: “Inscriptions” are exploiting a vulnerability in #Bitcoin  Core to spam the blockchain. Bitcoin Core has, since 2013, allowed users to set a limit on the size of extra data in transactions they relay or mine (`-datacarriersize`). By obfuscating their data as program code,… — Luke Dashjr (@LukeDashjr) December 6, 2023   The recently patched bug allowing inscriptions to exceed data limits was addressed in the latest update to Bitcoin Knots, a Bitcoin Core derivative featuring less tested or untested features backported from, and occasionally maintained outside of, the core code. When questioned on X about the potential cessation of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens if the vulnerability was resolved, Dashjr affirmed , “Correct,” though existing inscriptions would persist. Dashjr expressed concerns about the vulnerability persisting in the upcoming v26 release of Bitcoin Core, stating:  “Bitcoin Core is still vulnerable in the upcoming v26 release. I can only hope it will finally get fixed before v27 next year.” On December 6, Ocean, a decentralized mining protocol where Dashjr serves as chief technology officer, announced on X that the Bitcoin Knots upgrade “fixes this long-standing vulnerability exploited by modern spammers.” We are happy to announce testing of Bitcoin Knots v25.1 has completed successfully, and is now deployed to production. Among other improvements, this upgrade fixes this long-standing vulnerability exploited by modern spammers. As a result, our blocks will now include many more… https://t.co/II3y0B6Pu4  — OCEAN (@ocean_mining) December 6, 2023   In a recent update, Ocean Blockchain upgraded its Bitcoin node software to prioritize “real transactions” over Ordinals inscriptions, a feature that allows users to embed data and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) onto individual satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. This move implies that Ocean views Ordinals inscriptions as a form of denial-of-service attack on the Bitcoin network. Luke Dashjr, a prominent Bitcoin Core developer, has been a vocal critic  of Ordinals inscriptions, asserting that they are “doing huge and irreversible damage to Bitcoin and Bitcoin users.” He maintains that the Bitcoin community never authorized Ordinals and represent an attack on the network. idk, that was always a dumb narrative. While true that it would eventually be priced out, the damage it's doing to Bitcoin and Bitcoin users (including future users) in the meantime is huge and irreversible. There's no reason to let to run its course. — Luke Dashjr (@LukeDashjr) December 6, 2023   The introduction of the Ordinals protocol by Casey Rodarmor in January 2023 has sparked debate within the Bitcoin community, with some expressing concerns about its potential impact on network congestion and transaction fees. The recent surge in Ordinals inscriptions and BRC-20 token minting has indeed led to increased congestion, with over 275,000 unconfirmed transactions and average medium-priority transaction costs rising to around $14 from $1.50. Ocean’s decision to prioritize “real transactions” over Ordinals inscriptions signals a growing concern among some Bitcoin stakeholders about the potential negative effects of Ordinals on the network. While this move may help alleviate congestion in the short term, it also raises questions about the future of Ordinals and the balance between innovation and network sustainability."

Key Takeaways
 The financial landscape is undergoing a transformation with the rise of digital currencies, challenging the skepticism of some investors. Bitcoin, the foremost cryptocurrency globally, stands out as a compelling choice for those looking to hedge against inflation. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, expressed the view that Bitcoin could contribute to the extension of Western civilization. According to Armstrong , Bitcoin serves as an alternative to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, providing people with an option to hedge against inflation. In a recent post on X, Coinbase CEO pondered on the potential role of Bitcoin in shaping the future of Western civilization. Armstrong believes that fiat currencies, including the U.S. dollar, are on a trajectory of continuous inflation, diminishing their advantages as viable currencies. He asserts that while the U.S. dollar is already on this path, there are currently no other alternatives, as other fiat currencies face similar challenges. One idea I’ve been contemplating is that Bitcoin may be the key to extending western civilization. The natural trend of whichever country has the reserve currency is to inflate the money supply and increase deficit spending until it loses that advantage. The U.S. is somewhere on… — Brian Armstrong 🛡️ (@brian_armstrong) December 3, 2023   Armstrong also suggested that cryptocurrencies could serve as an alternative to traditional fiat currencies, even though many individuals may not currently be considering this option. He envisions a scenario where people shift from fiat currencies to cryptocurrencies as an “antidote to inflation.” Contrary to some opinions, Armstrong doesn’t foresee Bitcoin causing the demise of the U.S. dollar. Instead, he envisions cryptocurrency evolving into a “natural check and balance” for the American currency, serving as a safeguard for the interests of the American people and the broader Western civilization over the long term. In certain troubled countries in Latin America, such as Venezuela and Argentina, citizens are actively turning to cryptocurrencies as a means to combat inflation and devaluation resulting from weaknesses in their respective fiat currencies. The distinctive applications of cryptocurrencies in these circumstances were underscored in Chainalysis’ 2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report , emphasizing the importance of dollar-pegged stablecoins in addressing these economic challenges. The SEC and other U.S. regulators have initiated legal actions, urging American courts to apply federal investor protections to both Binance and Coinbase. These companies are contesting the allegations in court, contending that the SEC lacks jurisdiction over their activities. However, the legal process is a gradual method of instigating change in the market, with the added uncertainty that the SEC might not prevail in court. Regulatory showdown! Who will regulate crypto? SEC or CFTC? https://t.co/GxVYOUiFxN  — Rex Salisbury (@rexsalisbury) August 4, 2021   Although the SEC has achieved success in crypto litigation thus far, there is the acknowledgment that it faced setbacks, such as a federal judge dismissing part of its lawsuit against one of the major cryptocurrencies, XRP, in July. Meanwhile, there is a split in Congress regarding how to address the issue, with Republicans advocating for customized regulations on crypto, while top Democrats are inclined to let the SEC and other regulators oversee the system. Binance’s admission of guilt to money laundering and federal charges on November 21 marks a departure from its previous unregulated practices. In addition to acknowledging wrongdoing, Binance will pay a record-breaking $4.3 billion fine to the U.S. Treasury Department. Furthermore, the founder, CEO, and principal owner of Binance, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, considered one of the most influential figures in the crypto space, will be sidelined from the company for a minimum of three years under the oversight of a court-appointed monitor. Today, I stepped down as CEO of Binance. Admittedly, it was not easy to let go emotionally. But I know it is the right thing to do. I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility. This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself. Binance is no longer a baby. It is… — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) November 21, 2023   The agreement reached between Binance and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Treasury Department, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is expected to have industry-wide repercussions—potentially, not exclusively negative. Indeed, the deal is viewed as a “long-term positive” for the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. It holds significant importance for the sector, given that Binance, a stateless entity, is the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, having processed a substantial portion of all digital trades at times. Additionally, Zhao, who entered a separate plea deal, is widely recognized as a prominent figure in the industry, especially following the challenges faced by Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX."

Key Takeaways
 With the price of Bitcoin climbing above $40,000 on Monday, December 4, companies (and countries) that hold the asset have seen the value of their investments rise significantly since the crypto market turned bullish in October. Two of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders are MicroStrategy and Tether, which have both seen the value of their Bitcoin holdings swell to over a billion dollars more than what they initially paid. Under CEO Michael Saylor’s leadership, the software giant MicroStrategy has been stacking Bitcoin since 2020. Having been steadily adding to its stockpile since then, in September, the company’s Bitcoin investments represented unrealized losses of around $500M.  MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 16,130 BTC for ~$593.3 million at an average price of $36,785 per #bitcoin . As of 11/29/23, @MicroStrategy  now hodls 174,530 $BTC  acquired for ~$5.28 billion at an average price of $30,252 per bitcoin. $MSTR  https://t.co/hSEZyzGBsr  — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) November 30, 2023   But in less than 3 months, a strong crypto rally has reversed MicroStrategy’s fortunes as the value of its Bitcoin stash has swelled to around $7.2B, representing a profit of over $1.5B.  Moreover, the firm appears to have no intention of slowing down its BTC purchases, having acquired an additional 16,130 BTC in November. And neither is MicroStrategy alone in its commitment. While Tether has always held small amounts of Bitcoin in its stablecoin reserves, in May, the firm committed to allocating up to 15% of its net operating profits toward purchasing additional BTC. According to the company’s latest reserve report, at the close of Q3. Tether held BTC worth $1.66B. 1/ .@Tether_to  BTC balance increased by $176M compared to last q – Using the price as of 30 Jun, it is estimated that they hold ~55,022 BTC – Last Q, I mentioned the below address could belong to Tether:bc1qjasf9z3h7w3jspkhtgatgpyvvzgpa2wwd2lr0eh5tx44reyn2k7sfc27a4 pic.twitter.com/90DGmqQvLS  — Tom Wan (@tomwanhh) August 4, 2023   Based on the company’s quarterly disclosures, blockchain analyst Tom Wan identified a Bitcoin wallet that holds an amount similar to what Tether reports owning. The 11th most well-funded wallet in existence, the address identified by Wan has only ever received transfers from Bitfinex, a crypto exchange owned by Tether’s parent company iFinex.  Since receiving its first deposit in September 2022, further inflows have seen thousands of coins at a time transferred to the wallet in question, which now holds over 57,576 BTC worth more than $2.4B. Calculated from the Bitcoin price at the time of each deposit, the suspected Tether wallet’s holdings represent a $1.1B profit for the company."

Key Takeaways
 Though both the U.S. population and national debt are formidable figures, a rough estimate places the federal debt  at approximately $100,000 per individual in the United States. Amidst the United States’ ongoing challenge with substantial debt, there is a rising curiosity about how cryptocurrency could potentially provide solutions. According to the U.S. Census population clock , the U.S. population is roughly 336 million. Simultaneously, the U.S. Treasury Department approximates the national debt to be nearly $34 trillion . This calculation highlights the substantial financial burden carried by each American in terms of federal debt. 🚨🚨 US DEBT CRISIS NEWS 🚨🚨 The national debt just exceeded $100,000 per citizen. This should send a message to the White House that this reckless federal spending is at a breaking point. That's why I'm working with @SpeakerJohnson  & @HouseGOP  to rein in federal spending. — Rep. John James (@RepJames) December 4, 2023   Official data from the U.S. Treasury, released in the middle of the previous month, disclosed a fiscal year’s initial month with a federal government deficit of $67 billion . Growing concerns about the escalating debt are underscored by recent international credit downgrades for the U.S. As the United States grapples with a mounting debt crisis, the allure of Bitcoin as a haven against the dollar’s eroding purchasing power strengthens. The ballooning of the nation’s debt underscores the need for an alternative to the conventional financial system, a void Bitcoin was designed to fill. Its independence from central banks and governments grants it a unique level of financial autonomy. In the current precarious financial environment, the crypto industry emerges as a promising alternative to traditional financial systems, distinguished by its decentralization, transparency, and innovative features. The USA collects $5 trillion per year in revenue. Of that $2.5 trillion is personal income taxes.  $1 trillion per year (40% of personal income taxes) is paying the interest on the national debt.  $8 trillion in govt debt is maturing this year, old debt at lower interest rates.… https://t.co/D9VeNTsAiD  — Wall Street Silver (@WallStreetSilv) December 4, 2023   Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, utilizing blockchain technology, enable direct transactions without intermediaries. Proponents of cryptocurrency highlight its capacity to empower individuals, foster innovation, and create new economic opportunities. However, the US regulatory landscape poses significant obstacles to crypto adoption. The SEC’s scrutiny of crypto platforms like Coinbase and Binance, coupled with its delay of crypto ETF proposals, highlights its cautious stance, which critics argue stifles innovation and breeds uncertainty. In response, Coinbase has launched the “Stand With Crypto” campaign  to advocate for regulatory clarity and a revamped financial system that embraces digital assets. It criticizes the SEC’s enforcement-centric approach, asserting that it jeopardizes innovation, jobs, and US leadership in the global crypto arena. Underscoring its confidence in EU and UK regulatory developments, Coinbase has secured registrations in Spain, Germany, and Ireland.

Such measures could not only address the burgeoning debt crisis but also pave the way for a more resilient and innovative financial future.

2024-04-11 14:24:00+00:00,Bitcoin ETFs Approval Soon? Here’s How To Build an ETF Portfolio,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-etf-approval-build-portfolio/,"
Key Takeaways
 The long-awaited approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is on the horizon, with experts predicting that the first could be greenlit as early as 2024. This marks a significant milestone for cryptocurrency investors, who have been eagerly awaiting a regulated way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to purchase and store the digital asset themselves. In anticipation of this approval, many investors are already considering how to incorporate Bitcoin ETFs into their existing portfolios. While there are a few different ways to do this, the most common approach is to allocate a small percentage of your portfolio to Bitcoin ETFs. Obviously, the exact amount you allocate will depend on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are dynamic investment instruments that mirror the performance of an index or an asset class, offering a convenient gateway to diverse markets, ranging from worldwide shares to gold. Much like the meteoric rise of Amazon and the enduring appeal of Radiohead, ETFs have experienced a surge in popularity since their inception in the 90s, with over 5,000 globally managing assets exceeding $5 trillion. Setting them apart from traditional tracker funds, ETFs share similarities with stocks, contributing to their remarkable success. True to their name, ETFs are traded on exchanges, facilitating instantaneous buying or selling throughout the trading day – a departure from the typical restrictions imposed on many traditional funds, which can only be traded at day’s end. Rumors 🚨BlackRock #Bitcoin   ETF approval expected in next week. 👀🐂 pic.twitter.com/OMCp98uGCJ  — Whale.Guru (@Whale_Guru) November 27, 2023   In a nod to their stock-like nature, investors can engage in short selling, speculating on a price decline, or delve into options. They can also place bets on whether the ETF will trade above or below a specific price on a future date. Much like stocks, certain ETFs witness frenetic trading activity, changing hands thousands of times per second, while others see more measured transactions. This distinctive blend of index tracking and stock-like features renders ETFs a versatile and accessible investment option in the contemporary financial landscape. With a burgeoning selection of over 5,000 exchange-traded funds, their popularity continues to soar for several compelling reasons. Beyond providing seamless access to a diverse array of investments, ETFs typically boast lower fees compared to traditional funds and eliminate the need for minimum investment amounts. The average ETF charges approximately 0.4%, translating to a mere $4 annual fee for a $1,000 investment, in stark contrast to the typical 0.7% fee levied by traditional index funds. ETFs offer a versatile menu of options, allowing investors to track virtually any financial market imaginable, spanning Thai stocks and the U.S. dollar to platinum futures and German government bonds. Specialized sector-focused ETFs, such as those centered on technology stocks or petcare providers, further enhance the breadth of choices available. In an analogy, if stocks were likened to individual music tracks, ETFs would be akin to curated Spotify playlists. Instead of selecting individual investments, investors can choose a thematic “playlist” and gain exposure to a diversified selection of assets. While many ETFs adopt a passive approach, aiming to mimic market performance and keep fees low, there are innovative variations in the mix. Inverse ETFs, for instance, appreciate in value when the tracked index declines, providing a hedge against market downturns. Leveraged ETFs amplify the movements of their underlying investments, delivering multiplied returns. For instance, a 3x leveraged ETF would climb 6% if the S&P 500 rose 2%. The landscape also includes leveraged inverse ETFs for those seeking nuanced strategies. Incorporating ETFs into your investment strategy offers flexibility. You can either integrate them into a broader investment mix or construct an entire portfolio solely comprised of ETFs. They facilitate the creation of a balanced portfolio, where potential losses in one investment may be offset by gains elsewhere. Initiating your ETF investment journey amidst a vast selection of over 5,000 options requires some thoughtful selection. Keep in mind that the more ETFs you include, the higher the cost of adjusting your portfolio. Each trade in every ETF incurs a broker fee, a topic we’ll delve into in the next session. Determining the number of ETFs you need depends on your objectives. A straightforward approach involves just two ETFs – one tracking global stock markets and another monitoring a broad measure of bonds. This minimalist setup offers the advantage of simplicity. It makes it easy to monitor performance over time and rebalance between the two as needed. #Bitcoin  is likely to hit 5-10X after ETF approval. If this happens when Bitcoin is $60K, we are looking at $300-600K per #Bitcoin  after ETF approval. pic.twitter.com/rqNf0nB2w1  — Vivek⚡️ (@Vivek4real_) December 4, 2023   For a more diversified approach, consider spreading your investment across a handful of ETFs. This could involve allocating funds to a general U.S. stocks ETF, one for major non-US stock markets, an emerging market stocks fund, and a few bond ETFs with varying risk levels. You can even explore ETFs tracking commodities like gold or oil. Maintaining a keen eye on diversification is crucial; ensure that the holdings of your chosen ETFs don’t excessively overlap to maximize portfolio diversification. ETFs, being transparent, disclose their holdings daily, facilitating easy monitoring of their investment composition. Above all, prioritize the consideration of fees. Understand the annual charges imposed by the ETF provider and be aware of the fees your broker will levy for buying and selling. This emphasis on fees ensures that your investment strategy remains cost-effective and aligned with your financial goals. Acquiring your first ETF necessitates opening a brokerage account. This is an uncomplicated process with numerous online services available for buying, selling, and monitoring your ETFs, some even offering phone support. When venturing into ETF trading, keep a vigilant eye on trading fees. For instance, if your broker charges a $10 commission per trade and you plan to invest only $100 monthly in an ETF, you risk losing 10% of your investment immediately. In such scenarios, consider pooling your funds for fewer, larger deposits or explore traditional tracker funds where trades are not individually charged. Profit Potential:💰 How to profit?

Key Takeaways
 It has now been over 2 years since El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender –  a bold policy promoted by President Nayib Bukele. Since then, the decision has been subject to intense domestic and international criticism, often due to unrealized losses from the government’s own BTC investments.  However, after the latest crypto market rally, Bukele has reported that El Salvador’s Bitcoin investments are finally in the black. After buying large amounts of BTC in the $45,000–$60,000 range back in 2021/2022, the government of El Salvador saw the value of its holdings plummet throughout the prolonged crypto winter that followed. Yet, throughout the 2022 bear market, Bukele’s government continued to buy. Significantly, its last major purchase in December 2022 occurred near the bottom of the market. From a high of around $55,000, that investment helped bring the average price paid for Bitcoin in its portfolio down to just above $40,000. El Salvador's #Bitcoin  investments are in the black!

Commenting on the news, Bukele denounced the “thousands of articles and hit pieces” that had criticized the government for its earlier losses and called for the retraction of previous criticisms.  As the price of Bitcoin has risen in 2023, El Salvador’s economic outlook has improved. If the value of its reserves continues to grow, the government could sell its BTC at a tidy profit. But Bukele insisted that “we have no intention of selling.” #Bitcoin  | Estrategia de inversión del Presidente @nayibbukele  en bitcoin genera más de $3.5 millones en ganancias.

Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has been on a rollercoaster ride in recent years. After reaching an all-time high of nearly $20,000 in 2017, it plunged to around $3,000 in 2018. Then it came back to around $60,000 and now is at $40,000. Now, many analysts believe that it could reach $100,000 or more in 2024. This bullish forecast is being driven by a number of factors, including the growing adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors, the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the halving scheduled for April 2024. If BTC does reach $100,000, it would be a major turning point for the cryptocurrency, and it could even outshine traditional stocks as an investment asset. The king of digital assets underwent a notable surge in 2023, recording an increase of 130%. This resurgence is in stark contrast to the previous year’s poor performance. A projection from Standard Chartered not only confirms its previous predictions from April but aligns perfectly with Bitcoin‘s current growth trajectory. The surge in the value of Bitcoin can be attributed to several factors. Among these is the introduction of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. “This development has significantly amplified investor interest, significantly contributing to the increase in the value of Bitcoin,” the bank said. Furthermore, Standard Chartered  highlights Bitcoin’s dominant position in the cryptocurrency market as a key driver for its expected growth. The digital asset’s resilience and ability to maintain its prominent position amid market fluctuations positions it favorably for sustained expansion. #BITCOIN  TO HIT 100K BY THE END OF 2024? Standard Chartered Bank maintains its forecast from April that Bitcoin (BTC) will reach $100,000 by the end of 2024. A major factor in this prediction is the anticipated approval of several U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs in the first… pic.twitter.com/TQefOBv1Ty  — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) November 28, 2023   “A crucial event looming on the horizon is the imminent halving of Bitcoin. This process, characterized by a reduction in the number of Bitcoins allocated for mining, should exert a positive influence on the value of the cryptocurrency.” The convergence of the halving event with the overall positive sentiment and solid performance of Bitcoin creates an environment conducive to substantial growth. The bank’s projection is based on the continued growth and sustained dominance of Bitcoin in the market. In the evolving digital asset landscape, Bitcoin remains a pillar, potentially capable of reaching new heights in both value and influence over the next year. Rania Gule, market analyst at XS.com , said: “I believe developments in the Bitcoin ETF will influence the current upward trend, pushing it towards $50,000. This is especially true with signs of slowing inflation, and investors gaining confidence that the Federal Reserve has concluded its series of interest rate hikes.” Attention has shifted to expectations of potential interest rate cuts next year, supporting the current rise in global markets. “From my perspective, the cryptocurrency market will closely watch developments in applications submitted by major companies such as BlackRock Inc. to introduce the first Bitcoin ETF in the United States. I expect some of these funds to likely receive approval from the SEC by January next year. And the outcomes of these applications will have a significant impact on the digital asset market led by Bitcoin.” #Bitcoin  looks primed to reach the $50K mark with the bullish sentiment. pic.twitter.com/Pj2THDuLBz  — SHIB HODLER (@ShibaInuHodler) December 4, 2023   “I also believe that Bitcoin prices continue to receive support from expectations of the SEC approving interest rate reductions on exchange-traded funds and federal interest rates in 2024. The next levels to watch are $42,330, with the nearest support at $39,500.” Gule does not anticipate any significant price retracements, as breaking through the $40,000 zones and maintaining stability above them, coupled with rising expectations of the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the approaching halving event, and growing expectations of the Federal Reserve halting interest rate hikes, may lead to continued upward movement in the medium and long term. “There is a possibility of Bitcoin reaching $60,000 before the second half of April 2024.” He also believes that comments from Powell last week played a role in the likelihood that the tightening cycle has peaked. Cryptocurrencies were performing well in sync with the rise in gold, supported by falling yields. “It is noteworthy that Bitcoin surged even before the headlines of the approval of instant exchange-traded funds, indicating the current positivity in the market.” As Bitcoin continues its meteoric rise, the importance of the launch of the Spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States cannot be overstated. This milestone played a critical role in spurring investor interest in Bitcoin. “The ETF provides a regulated and accessible investment tool, which attracts institutional and retail investors. The capital injection from these diverse investor groups contributes to Bitcoin’s growing market capitalization,”  Standard Chartered added. Standard Chartered’s foresight is based on its recognition of Bitcoin’s resilience and its ability to weather the storms of market volatility. The cryptocurrency’s ability to bounce back from a difficult period in 2022 demonstrates its underlying strength and adaptability. With the increasing integration of Bitcoin into traditional financial ecosystems, its role as a store of value and hedge against inflation is gaining importance. The impending Bitcoin halving, a phenomenon built into the cryptocurrency’s code, adds a level of anticipation to market dynamics. “The reduction in supply of new Bitcoin, combined with sustained demand, creates an imbalance between supply and demand, contributing to upward pressure on prices. This inherent scarcity aligns with the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and its appeal as a deflationary digital asset.” Not only Bitcoin ETFs but also halving may boost the price of the cryptocurrency next year. Also, expectations of cuts in Fed interest rates may give a hand to Bitcoin to reach $100,000 in 2024. ""Declining 2-year UST yields show the market is betting on Fed cuts. This has already happened twice in the current cycle, but the Fed kept on hiking. With growth slowing below trend and inflation now close to target, the third time may be the charm.""@TS_Lombard  pic.twitter.com/RYjdCp1OZa  — Daily Chartbook (@dailychartbook) December 2, 2023   “Like most forecasters, my colleagues and I anticipate that growth in spending and output will slow over the next year, as the effects of the pandemic and the reopening fade and as restrictive monetary policy weighs on aggregate demand,” Fed’s chair, Jerome Powell, said, according to a transcript . His remarks have fueled expectations that the Federal Reserve may have concluded its current cycle of interest rate hikes. The series of rate increases initiated since March 2022 appears to have had a dampening effect on economic activity. It also prompted speculation that the Fed may now pause further rate hikes. If Bitcoin is going to reach $100,000, will it be an investment that is more profitable than stocks? Yes, according to many experts. Crypto analyst Raoul Pal has shared his insights on the current market sentiments, forecasting a stellar performance for Bitcoin in 2024. Pal, basing his predictions on trends and indicators, anticipates substantial growth for Bitcoin in the coming year. Pal’s optimism is grounded in his use of the GMI Financial Conditions Index, a tool he utilized to foresee the positive trend that BTC is poised to experience. His conviction in Bitcoin’s potential is shared by several other analysts who have also put forth similar predictions. One such analyst, Vetle Lunde from K33 Research, echoes Pal’s bullish sentiment on Bitcoin’s prices for the upcoming year. Lunde draws attention to the notable interest and price premiums observed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) as indicators of a positive trajectory for Bitcoin.

However, amidst the prevailing optimism, some crypto experts caution that Bitcoin might undergo a temporary setback. This can be of 20% to 30% before the halving event. This cautious stance is based on the analysis of Bitcoin’s historical patterns during the last four halving events. As the crypto community eagerly awaits the unfolding of events leading up to the halving, the diversity of predictions from various analysts adds an intriguing layer to the ongoing discourse surrounding the future of Bitcoin in 2024."

Key Takeaways
 When Peter Schiff first publicly discussed his disdain for Bitcoin on Joe Rogan’s podcast in January 2014, the cryptocurrency traded at less than $1,000.  As BTC embarked on a Monday rally, climbing above $41,000 for the first time since April 2021, Schiff used the occasion to celebrate a decade of Bitcoin bashing by engaging in two of his favorite pastimes – bigging up the gold market and predicting the cryptocurrency’s impending doom.  As he has almost continuously for the past 10 years, on Monday, December 04, Schiff warned that the price of Bitcoin is on course for a “spectacular” crash. Arguing that market excitement surrounding spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) amount to a “speculative frenzy,” he predicted that the $41K milestone could be Bitcoin’s swan song. #Gold  pulling back below $2,100 has provided a catalyst for #Bitcoin  to spike near $41K.

In contrast gold's rally is real. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 4, 2023   Schiff’s argument appears to rest on his belief that an anticipated Bitcoin ETF approval will trigger a mass selloff from speculative investors. However, in his multiple warnings that the market is primed to collapse once Bitcoin ETFs are approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission , Schiff hasn’t once attended to the reason investors are so hyped about the prospect.  According to Galaxy, Bitcoin ETFs could raise $38.6B from institutional investors within three years. In the long run, demand is expected to grow to $100B or more.

Key Takeaways
 When MicroStrategy started investing in Bitcoin in 2020, CEO Michael Saylor lauded the cryptocurrency as a “dependable store of value and an attractive investment asset.” At the end of November, MicroStrategy was sitting on Bitcoin worth over $7.2B, nearly $2B more than what it paid, cementing the firm’s position as the world’s largest BTC whale and seeming to validate Saylor’s enduring bullishness.  In a recent post on X, Saylor revealed that Microstrategy purchased 16,130 BTC in November at an average price of $36,785 per coin. Since it started investing in the cryptocurrency, MicroStrategy has paid an average of $30,252 per BTC. MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 16,130 BTC for ~$593.3 million at an average price of $36,785 per #bitcoin .

The recent spending spree has been especially prominent, but month after month, through bull and bear markets, the company has rarely stopped buying Bitcoin, even borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars to fund its purchases.  After crypto markets flatlined for most of the summer, at one point in September, Microstrategy had unrealized losses of around $500M from its Bitcoin investments.  In the long run, however, temporary losses could arguably be justified in the name of buying the dip. And for now, at least, Saylor’s strategy has paid off, with investments made when BTC was trading below $30,000 up 30% or more. MicroStrategy now owns so much BTC that it could soon control 1% of the total supply. According to Saylor’s latest announcement, the company holds 144,530 coins, representing nearly 0.74% of the circulating supply  of around 19.56M BTC on December 4. Given its massive crypto hoard, MicroStrategy’s share price has surged by around 275% in 2023, rising with the price of BTC.  Significantly, the company’s stock market performance throughout the year closely tracks the ups and downs of the crypto market.

2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Which Cryptocurrencies & High Inflation? Comparing Top Coins’ Inflation Rates,https://www.ccn.com/news/crypt-inflation-rates-comparing-top-coins/,"
Key Takeaways
 Cryptocurrency inflation is a major concern for many investors, especially those playing the long game, yet the concept is often poorly understood. If the total supply of a given token is increasing, it can be called inflationary. Meanwhile, deflationary coins are those with a shrinking supply. However, these basic definitions are complicated by the fact that cryptocurrencies with a fixed maximum supply like Bitcoin are often referred to as deflationary, even though mining or staking rewards tend to increase their total supply. This article delves into the inflation rates of the top 5 highest market capitalization cryptocurrencies.  The original cryptocurrency is “deflationary” in the sense that its maximum supply is capped at 21M coins. However, although over 93% of all coins have already been mined, producing the next 1.4M BTC will take a long time – around 117 years according to the current block schedule. Bitcoin inflation is determined by how much miners are awarded for each block. From an initial rate of 50 BTC per block, the reward rate is programmed to halve every 4 years. After 3 such halving events, miners currently earn 6.25 BTC per block, but rewards are expected to be cut by 50% again in April 2024. Were it a purely mathematical model, Bitcoin inflation would remain consistent between halving events. The reality is less tidy, however.  Although bound by the Bitcoin protocol to generate a new block every 10 minutes, the globally distributed network of miners is also constrained by physics. Over the course of a month, small fluctuations in the time it takes to generate each block add up. As such, the monthly BTC inflation rate has fluctuated between 1.4% and 1.9% since the last halving. While the total Bitcoin supply is set to keep increasing until the year 2140, because of the different way Ethereum issues new coins, changes to the ETH supply are more dynamic.  Since implementing a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism in 2022, rewards have been granted to validators based on the value of their staked ETH.  Rather than a fixed reward rate, Ethereum’s overall issuance of new tokens is determined by how many validators there are. However, the additional supply created by validator rewards isn’t the only factor determining the ETH inflation rate. Gas fees also play a role. Unlike Bitcoin transaction fees, which are returned to miners as an additional source of BTC alongside block rewards, Ethereum burns a portion of all gas fees, permanently removing ETH from circulation.   Because it has an in-built mechanism for reducing the total supply of tokens, Ethereum inflation fell dramatically after the network transitioned to PoS, when the issuance of new coins fell from around 5.4M ETH to 500,000 ETH per year. In fact, throughout the spring and early summer of 2023, the cryptocurrency was properly deflationary, with monthly inflation falling as low as -1% at one point. Although it has risen since then, Ethereum’s inflation rate remains far lower than Bitcoin’s, rarely breaking above 1% in recent months. Borrowing many elements of Ethereum’s design, BNB chain operates a variation of PoS. While BNB has a dynamic supply, it was designed to be deflationary from the outset. With significantly fewer validators than Ethereum (32 versus over a million ), BNB generates staking rewards from transaction fees alone.  To reduce the total supply over time, the blockchain has an in-built quarterly token-burning mechanism. Every 3 months, a portion of BNB is permanently destroyed. This process is expected to continue until the total supply reaches 100M. #Binance  completes the 25th Quarterly #BNB  Burn! 🔥 2.14m #BNB  has been burned 🔥 pic.twitter.com/3KtkE1y6f5  — Binance (@binance) October 16, 2023   During the most recent quarterly burn, the network’s 25th, around 2.1M BNB was removed from circulation. As a result of the burn, the circulating supply of BNB declined by 1.38% in Q3, 2023, representing a monthly inflation rate of around -1.16% and continuing the deflationary trend of previous quarters. Unlike most cryptocurrency networks, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) doesn’t reward validators, relying on a consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Association (PoA) rather than the PoW or PoS systems used by Bitcoin Ethereum and BNB. A unique feature of PoA is that all of the 100B XRP in existence were minted at the point of genesis and there is no way to generate more.  Because XRPL doesn’t need to pay validators for their work, 100% of transaction fees are burned. Although the XRPL burn rate creates deflationary pressure, its effect is outweighed by a stream of 1B vested XRP released to Ripple each month.  Between the second and third quarter of 2023, the release of XRP to Ripple increased the token’s circulating supply by 8.6%. This translates to a monthly inflation rate of 1.94%. Were the monthly XRP unlocks the only factor determining XRP inflation, it would be easy to predict. However, the net increase in circulating XRP is often less than 1B. Having initially placed 55B XRP into a cryptographically secured escrow account in 2017, the monthly unlocking schedule should have released the entire XRP supply. However, Ripple has historically returned a portion of the vested tokens it receives back into escrow. While this has helped tamp inflation, it also delayed the day when XRP becomes properly deflationary. At present, Ripple’s vested XRP still accounts for around 40% of the token’s total supply and it could be many years before the full 100B coins circulate freely. In contrast with the other 4 coins on this list, Solana wasn’t necessarily intended to reach a deflationary state. Instead, it started with an annual inflation rate of 8% (1.9% monthly) which reduces by 15% each year.  The tapering mechanism will then stabilize once inflation has fallen to 1.5% (1.034% monthly), where it is expected to remain fixed. Solana’s current monthly rate of inflation is 1.156%. With no guarantee that the total SOL supply will ever reach a peak, long-term investors should be wary of leaving their coins idle. As with other PoS cryptocurrencies, SOL holders can mitigate the effects of inflation by staking. As long as less than 100% of the token’s total supply is staked, the rate of return from staking yields is guaranteed to be higher than the rate of inflation. This prevents the issuance of new SOL from diluting existing stakers’ share of the total supply. (Provided they aren’t getting ripped off by third-party validator operators.)"

The video was a follow-up to his latest AMA, in which he criticized the SEC’s preferential treatment of Bitcoin. “On day one, Satoshi had 100% of the hash power and complete and absolute control of the Bitcoin network. There was no notion of a fair launch,” Hoskinson said. He likely mined a “non-trivial amount” of the supply in a completely centralized way. Yet Bitcoin fans now criticize other projects’ beginnings despite Bitcoin’s own opaque early history, Hoskinson argued. Hoskinson also speculated that Nakamoto could have made side financial deals during Bitcoin’s launch. “What if Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to take two years off from work and made a side deal with one of his friends?” Hoskinson asked. In theory, Nakamoto could have offered mining proceeds to a friend funding his time off, not unlike the private sales or “ICOs” (initial coin offerings) that draw criticism in crypto’s “altcoin” space today. “Yes, that’s kind of a ICO. Isn’t this kind of a pre-sale?” Hoskinson said, underscoring what he sees as inconsistencies and hypocrisy. He lamented maximalists who call other crypto assets “scams” despite Bitcoin’s own unconventional start. The Cardano creator reserved special frustration for the maximalist camp’s lobbying to outlaw competitors and undermine open blockchain innovation happening outside of Bitcoin. “I know for a fact, I’ve spoken with staff of lawmakers, who that same day spoke to members of the Bitcoin community, prominent influencers, who literally just had a meeting where they were told everything but Bitcoin should be made illegal in the United States,” Hoskinson revealed. He went on to discuss the unique capabilities of other crypto projects besides Bitcoin: “The Bitcoin core protocol does not have smart contracts that are capable of doing the things that Cardano on Ethereum can do. There are no DEXs, there are no Oracles, there are no algorithmic stablecoins, there are no on-chain DAOs, there is no on-chain infrastructure.” Hoskinson suggested Satoshi himself would have embraced innovations like smart contracts if available when launching Bitcoin. The reality is crypto projects have more similarities than differences in working to return economic power to individuals, Hoskinson said, yet the maximalists continue attacking competition. What is #cryptocurrency ? Is it more than just tokens, and is it here to stay? Charles Hoskinson from Input Output Global, sheds light on and dispels common misconceptions about cryptocurrencies.@tomurquhart  @ADFinanceWeek #DubaiEyeLiveonDubaiOne  #DubaiOneTv  #ADFW  pic.twitter.com/xcKftwI2nd  — Dubai One (@DubaiOneTV) November 29, 2023   The divide and acrimony plays right into the hands of authorities who feel threatened by that ethos, he warned: “They understand that if the world gets back control of its money, of its voting of its identity and data, that it’s going to be really hard to put a global regime over humanity, and have a small group of people run the whole show.” Hoskinson called for maturity and responsibility to overcome tribalist infighting. “Being your own bank, owning your own identity, having control of your own voice…These things require integrity, they require accountability. They require some investment of time,” he counseled. Such attacks on open source crypto progress motivate an “us vs. them” tribalism that only serves the interests of centralized authorities looking to control blockchain technology, Hoskinson argued. Crypto projects have far more similarities than differences, he said, making calls for unity reasonable. Yet the maximalist camp continues fanning the flames of division. “It’s got to stop. It really has to,” an exasperated Hoskinson urged. In the final stretch of his video, Hoskinson railed against government forces corroding freedoms. With targeted policies and institutional absorption threatening the still-fledgling crypto industry, Hoskinson warned that “we just got to grow up.”  “We are so close to CBDCs, we are so close to AI being integrated with CBDCs and social credit becoming a universal concern… we have whole nation states like China pursuing it and giving us paint by numbers reality for that.”"

Key Takeaways
 The Inverse Cramer Signal, a phenomenon frequently utilized, involves buying stocks that TV host Jim Cramer has suggested are likely to decline. This time, Cramer put all his cons on Bitcoin – and was wrong – again. However, he did admit his premonitions were a little bit “premature.” Markets commentator Jim Cramer admitted  to misjudging Bitcoin’s trajectory, acknowledging that his previous advice to sell the cryptocurrency was premature. In a recent CNBC Mad Money segment , Cramer responded to a caller’s query about investing in Bitcoin miner CleanSpark by encouraging those optimistic about Bitcoin to increase their holdings. “Look, if you like Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin. That has always been my view. And for a while, I liked it, and I decided that money had been made, but I was premature,” Cramer said . Cramer further mentioned that although his past calls on Bitcoin may not have been flawless, he emphasized that he had still generated significant profits from his investment in the cryptocurrency. On December 5, 2022, when Bitcoin was priced at $17,150, Jim Cramer advised investors to liquidate all their crypto holdings . He argued that it was “never too late to sell an awful position.” Since then, Bitcoin has surged by 118% , with the current BTC price at $37,390. Cramer’s predictions, coupled with his fluctuating relationship with crypto, have turned into a well-known meme within investment circles in recent years. Many highlight his seemingly inconsistent ability to make accurate calls during critical moments. In August 2022, a crypto trader claimed  to have doubled the size of their portfolio by simply trading in the opposite direction of Cramer’s recommendations. Officially doubled the inverse @jimcramer  account, for those who are not aware i started the account with 50k honestly mind blowing how wrong one man can be pic.twitter.com/mH3DhEdJFs  — Algod(τ, τ) (@AlgodTrading) August 22, 2022   Two months later, on October 6, an investment fund filed for an “inverse Cramer ETF,”  a financial instrument designed to yield results opposite to the investments recommended by Jim Cramer, before fees and expenses. Cramer’s track record with crypto has led many investors to believe that the opposite of his recommendations may be more profitable. This phenomenon has been dubbed the “Cramer Effect.“  While the “Cramer Effect” is not always reliable, it has proven to be profitable in some cases. Investors who are considering trading crypto may want to keep an eye on Cramer’s recommendations, but they should also be aware of the potential for the “Cramer Effect” to work against them. Cramer’s fluctuating relationship with crypto began in 2017 when he called Bitcoin a “bubble” and warned investors to stay away from it. However, he later changed his tune and began recommending crypto to his viewers. In 2021, Cramer once again warned investors about crypto, saying that it was “too late” to get in. However, he once again reversed his position in 2022, saying that crypto was a “buy.” Cramer’s inconsistent recommendations have led to confusion among investors. Many are unsure whether to trust his advice, especially when it comes to crypto.

Key Takeaways
 Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has resigned  as CEO of Binance as part of a significant $4 billion settlement reached between the cryptocurrency exchange he established and various United States regulatory agencies. The announcement , made by Zhao and several regulatory bodies on Tuesday, November 21, marks the conclusion of extensive investigations by entities such as the Department of Justice into allegations of anti-money laundering violations and sanctions breaches. The SEC had previously accused Binance and CZ in June of running an unregistered exchange and misleading investors by utilizing a Switzerland-based fund, Sigma Chain, also owned by CZ, to artificially boost trading volume on Binance’s U.S. platform. SEC Chair Gary Gensler then stated that through thirteen charges, they alleged Zhao and Binance entities engaged in deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and deliberate evasion of the law. Be it as it may, the case is still ongoing, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, whose company has also faced regulatory scrutiny, welcomed the action  against Binance as an opportunity to establish clear regulatory guidelines for the cryptocurrency industry. Since the founding of Coinbase back in 2012 we have taken a long-term view. I knew we needed to embrace compliance to become a generational company that stood the test of time. We got the licenses, hired the compliance and legal teams, and made it clear our brand was about trust… — Brian Armstrong 🛡️ (@brian_armstrong) November 21, 2023   Armstrong furthermore emphasized  the importance of compliance in the cryptocurrency industry. He mentioned that Coinbase obtained the necessary licenses, established compliance and legal teams, and became a public company to prioritize trust and adherence to regulations. While this approach meant slower expansion and financial challenges for Coinbase, Armstrong suggested that the compliance approach was the right path. In contrast, he alluded to Binance’s recent settlement and CZ stepping down, implying that Binance faced difficulties due to its non-compliant practices. Last year, Armstrong was all about highlighting the lack of regulatory clarity from the SEC, stating that 95% of trading activity goes offshore due to the absence of clear regulations. He then argued that it is unreasonable to penalize U.S. companies when the SEC has not provided sufficient guidance. https://t.co/0HxlRiI6Sy  was an offshore exchange not regulated by the SEC. The problem is that the SEC failed to create regulatory clarity here in the US, so many American investors (and 95% of trading activity) went offshore. Punishing US companies for this makes no sense. — Brian Armstrong 🛡️ (@brian_armstrong) November 10, 2022   Armstrong made these comments  in response to a statement from U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who criticized the crypto industry as “smoke and mirrors” following the collapse of FTX last year. Armstrong then emphasized that FTX.com was an offshore exchange not regulated by the SEC. That being said, John E. Deaton, Ripple’s lawyer, shares the view  that Coinbase could emerge as a significant beneficiary. He points to the narrative around exchange-traded funds (ETFs), emphasizing that Coinbase plays a crucial role in this space. The regulatory developments and actions against Binance might position Coinbase, with its compliance-focused approach, to thrive in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. @coinbase  will be a big winner. I expect to see BlackRock and Vanguard buy more. Btw, 90% of @GaryGensler ’s $120M fortune is with Vanguard. See how this works, yet? https://t.co/WHWGNY4vQJ  — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) November 21, 2023   The prominence of Coinbase Inc. is notably highlighted in the spot ETF applications submitted by various institutional players such as BlackRock, Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and Fidelity. This recognition is particularly emphasized through the inclusion of Coinbase in their surveillance sharing agreement (SSA) , as outlined in Nasdaq’s 19b-4 form. The widespread acknowledgment of Coinbase as the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. is a key factor contributing to its popularity in this context. Gensler was asked today in a webinar about Coinbase being at center of ETF filings. He couldn't comment on the filings but went pretty negative on crypto exchanges saying they operate ""conflicting services"" and have ""limited risk monitoring"" Here's full quote via @TheBlock__  pic.twitter.com/iCVl906GyF  — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 12, 2023   A Surveillance Sharing Agreement (SSA) is a formal arrangement between cryptocurrency exchanges and regulatory bodies or market surveillance providers, such as the SEC. Its purpose is to enhance the integrity and transparency of the crypto market by facilitating the sharing of trading data and relevant information. Coinbase plays a significant role in the U.S.-based spot trading platform for Bitcoin, representing a substantial portion of Bitcoin trading denominated in U.S. dollars. The collaboration between Coinbase and the CBOE ETF applications commenced on June 21. In the past, the SEC raised concerns about cryptocurrency exchanges engaging in “conflicting activities” and having “limited monitoring.” If spot ETFs are approved, institutional players would have the ability to share trade data, book information, and other pertinent market data with the commission. This collaboration aims to address the SEC’s concerns about potential market manipulation, providing greater transparency and confirmation of fair market practices. Deaton has disclosed  that he expanded his holdings in Coinbase (COIN) shares, anticipating that Coinbase is positioned to be a major beneficiary in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

Buying Bitcoin in times of economical uncertainty became an almost traditional thing to do. Shutting down the exchange can have multiple outcomes. Also, Bitcoin has experienced a recent surge fueled by rumors that U.S. regulators might approve Bitcoin spot ETFs. Analysts speculate that this development could attract a significant influx of capital into the cryptocurrency market. It has recently been observed  that Bitcoin (BTC) held in wallets associated with centralized cryptocurrency exchanges is increasing at the quickest rate since May, suggesting a possible pause in the bullish market. Glassnode’s  Bitcoin exchange net position change metric, which assesses the number of coins held by exchange wallets compared to the same date four weeks ago, surged to 31,382.43 BTC ($1.16 billion) on Sunday, marking the highest level since May 11, 2023. This rise has elevated the total balance held on exchanges to 2.35 million BTC.

Key Takeaways
 Javier Milei secured the presidency of Argentina  in a surprising turn of events. Initially considered a long-shot candidate, he triumphed after running a dynamic campaign that encapsulated distinctive and often controversial ideas, garnering a majority of the votes. After the win was pronounced, Bitcoin witnessed a 2.17% rise, reaching $37,374.20, while Ethereum increased by 2.10%, trading at $2,012.48. The value of cryptocurrencies experienced an increase following the victory of the pro-Bitcoin presidential candidate during the second round. The surge in risk assets was noted as preliminary results were announced amid the country’s struggle with high inflation. Milei has previously voiced support for the largest cryptocurrency, emphasizing its role in returning money to the private sector. 💥 New Argentinian 🇦🇷 President #JavierMilei  ""Central Banks are a scam"" 👏 He has radical views to fix an economy battered by triple-digit inflation, a looming recession and rising poverty. Lets see if Argentina follows in El Salvadors 🇸🇻 footsteps and embraces #Bitcoin  pic.twitter.com/MN8pPJth2c  — Crypto Rand (@crypto_rand) November 20, 2023   Over the past few years, Argentina’s economy and its 46 million citizens have faced considerable challenges. The inflation rate has soared to nearly 140% year-over-year,  and over 40% of the population is grappling with poverty. These issues were escalating even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the analyst Michael Cembalest of JP Morgan Asset Management  highlighting in the second half of 2019 that Argentina had defaulted seven times since its independence in 1816. The country has witnessed the most significant relative standard of living decline globally since 1900 and was teetering on the brink of political and economic turmoil in 2019. To underscore the magnitude of these challenges, Cembalest pointed out  that Argentina’s per capita GDP has barely doubled in over a century. However, after Milei won, it seems everybody, including Elon Musk  himself, believed that Argentina was facing a brighter future. Prosperity is ahead for Argentina — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 19, 2023   Milei and his triumph in Argentina sparked discussions about his plan to eliminate the national currency, potentially paving the way for the official and unofficial dollarization of the country, aligning with the prevailing preference for the US dollar in the local economy. The people of Argentina have long sought the stability and trustworthiness offered by the US dollar, leading to an increased usage of stablecoins in the country. Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis firm, has recently reported  that Argentina is at the forefront of Latin America in terms of raw transaction volume in cryptocurrencies, recording over $85 billion in value received in the year leading up to July 2023. Notably, stablecoins contribute to approximately 31% of Argentina’s modest retail-sized cryptocurrency transaction volume. Milei’s ascent suggests a potential shift towards a dollarized Argentina, both in an official and unofficial capacity. However, a notable and often overlooked factor is Milei’s strong advocacy for Bitcoin. In a previous interview, Milei expressed : “With legal tender, they scam you with the inflationary tax… Bitcoin is the natural reaction against central bank scammers; to make money private again.” “With legal tender, they scam you with the inflationary tax… #Bitcoin  is the natural reaction against central bank scammers; to make money private again.” – Javier Milei, President of Argentina 🇦🇷🇦🇷pic.twitter.com/Rs2yXFo4e7  — Dylan LeClair 🟠 (@DylanLeClair_) November 19, 2023   While a complete transition to a Bitcoin standard in Argentina may pose significant challenges, considering even El Salvador has struggled to replace US dollars for transactions, there might be an alternative perspective.

Saylor then remarked : “If I had one request from the Bitcoin community, my request would be – focus your guns on gold. Ultimately, gold is being de-monetized. This is not speculation on the part of Michael Saylor. You have all the stats. It has been de-monetized for the past decade. It doesn’t have a country. It doesn’t have an army. It doesn’t collect taxes. There is not a single person on earth that is going to lie down in front of a tank to protect the nation of gold. And yet, gold is the enemy. Because gold is a dumb rock. You can’t mortgage your gold. You can’t lien on your gold. It is hard to rent your gold. Or license it. Or develop it further. Gold is not big tech. You can’t put gold on your iPhone.” Perhaps, for Argentina, the path forward involves embracing both US dollars and Bitcoin, recognizing the significance of each in the current landscape. This nuanced approach could mark a new era in economic thinking tailored to the demands of the 21st century. While the journey may encounter bumps along the way, the necessity for change is becoming increasingly evident. As we approach the 2024 Presidential election in America, this evolving economic landscape should be considered. Several candidates have already expressed strong support for Bitcoin, indicating a potential scenario where US dollar dominance continues alongside the embrace of Bitcoin as a digital gold."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Bitcoin Bull Run: What Evidence Supports a BTC Price Rise?,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-bull-run-evidence-supports-btc-price-rise/,"
Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin (BTC) has made a remarkable comeback this year, with many analysts predicting continued gains in the near future. This bullish sentiment is fueled by several factors, including the anticipated approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With these factors converging to create a supportive environment, the question remains: what is the upside potential for Bitcoin? Bitcoin has experienced a 120% surge  in its price this year, and many analysts anticipate additional gains in the short term. This optimism is rooted in the expectation that the SEC will soon approve one or more spot ETFs, coupled with the impending halving of the Bitcoin blockchain’s mining reward scheduled for April next year. The bullish outlook  is further bolstered by positive shifts in the broader economy, indicating a favorable turnaround in the macroeconomic factors that contributed to last year’s price downturn. The chart  illustrates the balance between central banks’ tightening and loosening policies since 1947. Positive values indicate a net inclination for tighter monetary conditions, while negative values signal a preference for easing. Loose policies involve injecting more money into the financial system through measures like interest-rate cuts and fostering risk-taking, as evident in the 18 months following the March 2020 coronavirus crash . Conversely, tight monetary policies, achieved through interest-rate hikes, aim to reduce liquidity to curb inflation, dampening risk-taking, as witnessed last year. The plot has recently trended lower, suggesting that the global tightening cycle from the previous year, impacting financial markets, including cryptocurrencies, has peaked. There is now a growing bias toward easing liquidity as inflation rates worldwide decelerate. With central banks having leeway to ease off tightening measures, this shift may lead to increased capital flowing into the crypto market. Bitcoin, known for its sensitivity to global liquidity changes, tends to rally when there is more money circulating. The chart below depicts Goldman Sachs’ U.S. Financial Conditions Index (FCI)  since January, revealing a significant decline from the recent high of 100.74 to just under 100. This reversal undoes the tightening observed in September and October, contrasting with the Federal Reserve’s commitment to maintaining higher interest rates for an extended period. ""Yesterday’s US FCI easing of -23bps was historic… it ranks as the 30th biggest 1d easing event going back to 1990."" – Goldman Sachs pic.twitter.com/V8mhBOI17J  — Daily Chartbook (@dailychartbook) November 15, 2023   This shift suggests a resilient U.S. economy ahead, presenting a positive outlook for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Notably, the majority of Bitcoin’s year-to-date gains have occurred during U.S. trading hours. The FCI is a composite measure that considers short-term and long-term interest rates, the trade-weighted U.S. dollar exchange rate, credit spreads, and the equity prices to earnings per share ratio. A 1% decrease (increase) in the index is known to generate a 1% positive (negative) GDP impulse in the subsequent three to four quarters. An encouraging factor for Bitcoin is the reduction in the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, which has decreased by 50 basis points to 4.43% following the Treasury’s announcement of a more gradual pace of bond purchases at the beginning of the month. A drop in the 10-year yield, often considered the risk-free rate, typically prompts investors to explore higher-yield alternatives such as stocks and cryptocurrencies. There’s potential for a further decline in the 10-year yield, as indicated by the daily chart displaying a bearish head-and-shoulders technical analysis pattern. “10-year yields delivered a lower high (as expected) and broke lower, clearing a head and shoulders top. The pattern yields a target of about 3.93%, but current levels (uptrend) and 4.33% (breakout point) are potential supports too,” noted EFG Bank’s research team stated . The shift in Goldman’s FCI index indicating a relaxation of financial conditions may prompt a more hawkish stance in Federal Reserve communications, leading markets to reassess the likelihood of another rate hike in the near future. This could potentially decelerate Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Bullish investors should also monitor Japan’s departure from ultra-easy monetary policy , geopolitical tensions, concerns in the U.S. commercial property sector, and the potential resurgence of inflation as factors that could contribute to price volatility in risk assets. cash-flow implies enterprise risk, or with debt default risk. bitcoin is a commodity money. even with US treasuries you're pretty much guaranteed to lose money in real-terms because inflation is likely 10-15% vs 4.5% interest. — Adam Back (@adam3us) March 29, 2023   On November 17, the analyst ‘CryptoCon ‘ observed the increasing strength of altcoins despite significant movements in Bitcoin. They highlighted this strength through both the upward trend in altcoin strength and the breach of the 50-week SMA (simple moving average) barrier. Historically, strong upward price action has followed the crossing of this technical indicator in previous market cycles, such as 2016 and 2017. However, this cycle’s cross has occurred a bit earlier than usual, anticipated for the following year.

Key Takeaways
 The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant decline after a surge in futures liquidations. These liquidations occur when traders cannot meet margin requirements, forcing them to sell their positions at a loss. The sudden increase in selling pressure overwhelmed the market, causing Bitcoin prices  to fall more than 3% in 24 hours. The downturn in major cryptocurrencies has triggered a wave of liquidations in the derivative market. In the last 24 hours, long positions totaling over $160 million  have been liquidated across the crypto market, with $144.3 million getting wiped out in the preceding 12 hours. The negative impact on crypto market prices occurs when long derivative positions are liquidated without the corresponding buying pressure from trading volume. Despite a downturn in the overall crypto market today, specific altcoins  have exhibited strong performance. 🐶 #Dogecoin  has had a modest +5% surge on a mostly flat #crypto  market day. It has been aided by $665M in #onchain  transaction volume, its highest level in 3 months.

The crypto market is also experiencing a downward trend as investors and fund managers contemplate the potential consequences of a potential delay by the SEC in reviewing existing spot Bitcoin ETF applications. XRP and other altcoins see a decline following a fraudulent ETF filing. This market downturn coincides with a crucial week when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is slated to evaluate several pending spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Notably, decisions on the application from Global X ETF are expected by November 17, while Franklin Templeton’s Bitcoin ETF application is due by November 21. Failure to meet these deadlines could extend the decision to 2024. Analysts anticipate another delay  pointing to a false BlackRock XRP trust filing that caused significant price fluctuations  in the XRP markets and triggered an investigation request to the United States Department of Justice. Okay, we're nearing in on deadline dates for 3 spot #Bitcoin  ETF applications. I want to get ahead of it because there's a pretty good chance we'll see delay orders from the SEC. Delays WOULD NOT change anything about our views & 90% odds for 19b-4 approval by Jan 10, 2024 pic.twitter.com/LE7sOlHAHM  — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 14, 2023   This incident may hinder the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. by supporting the SEC’s concerns about price manipulation in the cryptocurrency industry. Given the potential for a prolonged waiting period, traders appear to be securing profits at the current multi-month high prices in the cryptocurrency market. Market optimism surged at the beginning of November amid hopes for a potential approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), propelling the price of Bitcoin to 18-month highs surpassing $38,000. However, this enthusiasm appears to be waning, as Bitcoin experienced a 4% drop on Nov. 16, attributed to low liquidity at higher levels. Although the market anticipated an ETF approval by Nov. 17, the likelihood has diminished. The SEC already postponed Hashdex’s application  for a spot Bitcoin ETF conversion on Nov. 15. Despite BlackRock’s confidence that the SEC lacks valid reasons to reject a cryptocurrency spot ETF, signs suggest the SEC is leaning towards a delay. On Nov. 15, the SEC deferred a decision on Grayscale’s Ether futures ETF. Some analysts view Grayscale’s 19b-4 form submission as a potential “trojan horse” strategy employed by the agency. Be it as it may, the crypto market is facing a period of uncertainty and volatility due to a combination of factors, including the recent wave of liquidations in the derivative market, the potential delay in the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and the false BlackRock XRP trust filing. While some altcoins have shown resilience, the overall trend is downward. Investors should be cautious and carefully consider their investment strategies in this challenging environment."

In an interview this week, ARK Invest CEO, Cathie Wood, expressed cautious optimism that the SEC is moving towards approving a spot Bitcoin ETF, citing the regulator’s shift to asking more extensive questions of ETF applicants. “Something has changed,” she said in an interview. However, the path is not yet totally clear. Wood points to potential complications from Grayscale’s plans to convert its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF format. If the SEC denies Grayscale’s application, the firm may sue the regulator which could stall approvals for other Bitcoin ETF applications.

""Something has changed"" 👀  pic.twitter.com/EfKHtiS6rK  — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) November 14, 2023   Still, Wood believes the chances for eventual approval are higher than ever. The SEC engaging more deeply with ETF applicants indicates they are seriously considering the proposals. Amendment filings from ETF applicants like GlobalX  also show momentum toward approval. Cathie Wood is also considering the possibility that an approval is already priced in. In an interview  with PRO Talks on Tuesday, November 16, 2023, she said: “When you get a lot of anticipatory investing like this sometimes you don’t get [a significant price upswing] right away. There could just be profit-taking especially if it settles down a bit.” Earlier this week, Wood sold  $6M of shares in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), cashing in on the recent rally in Bitcoin’s price which is up 28% over the last 30 days. The launch of even one SEC-approved spot Bitcoin ETF would likely open the floodgates of mainstream investment into crypto. Major players like BlackRock, Valkyrie, and ARK have spot Bitcoin ETF applications pending – these would compete directly with Grayscale. Crypto prices could get a boost from the influx of new capital.

Analysts at JPMorgan believe existing capital will simply shift into new ETFs rather than attracting significant fresh investments. They also caution that hopes for a more lenient regulatory climate are unrealistic given recent market troubles. With major actions still pending against players like Binance and Coinbase, the outlook remains challenging. JPMorgan also contends the upcoming Bitcoin halving is already priced in. As such, they remain cautious on a big market bounce. American stockbroker, Peter Schiff, has even warned of a crash following an ETF approval. While approval could come before year end, the timing is still uncertain. Grayscale’s potential lawsuit and conversion process could delay the SEC greenlighting other Bitcoin ETF applications. Still, continued engagement between the SEC and applicants is a positive sign. When launch does come, a spot Bitcoin ETF would validate crypto in mainstream finance. This could bolster long-term adoption of digital assets. Of course, an ETF would also open crypto to new speculation and volatility. But for now, investors remain excited at the prospect that the crypto ETF barrier may soon be broken."

Key Takeaways
 The Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for the United States, a gauge of retail inflation, fell slightly  below market expectations. This lower-than-expected headline CPI inflation not only affected stock markets but also influenced the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. While a global buying spree has influenced various markets, Bitcoin registered a 3% decline  following the release of soft U.S. inflation data that prompted increased risk appetite across different assets. This dip contrasts with a 2% surge in a global stock index , reflecting expectations that the Federal Reserve will shift from interest-rate hikes to cuts in the coming year. GM, #Bitcoin  decoupling  The 30-day correlation coefficient for Bitcoin and MSCI Inc.’s gauge of world stocks now sits at minus 0.23, the most negative since the onset of the pandemic in early 2020 – Bloomberg — Crowfield (@crow_xbt) November 15, 2023   The 30-day correlation coefficient between Bitcoin and MSCI Inc.’s global stock gauge now stands at minus 0.23, marking the most negative correlation since the start of the pandemic  in early 2020. A correlation coefficient of 1 indicates synchronized movement, while minus-1 signifies opposing directions. Under normal circumstances, a decline in bond yields, a surge in equities, and the anticipation of a Federal Reserve policy reversal would typically be perceived as a favorable environment  for cryptocurrencies, given their association with speculative enthusiasm. However, Bitcoin had already experienced a doubling in value in 2023, driven in part by optimism surrounding the potential approval of the first U.S. exchange-traded funds directly investing in the token. These substantial gains prompted a degree of caution regarding the extent to which Bitcoin could further advance.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin, having previously reached a record high of nearly $69,000 in late 2021, was trading  at approximately $36,258. The second-ranked token, Ethereum , was hovering just below $2,000. Cryptocurrency has frequently been hailed as a panacea  for various economic challenges, from inflation and low-interest rates to diminished purchasing power and the devaluation of traditional currencies. These optimistic views were easily embraced during the period when cryptocurrency values were on the rise, seemingly independent of other financial assets. According to  Brian Spinelli, co-chief investment officer at wealth advisor Halbert Hargrove: “Higher rates generally lower appetite for riskier investments, and that is likely one of the causes for a significant pullback in digital asset prices over the last year.” In fact, cryptocurrencies, much like other high-risk assets, responded to diminished liquidity. This decline was evident when the Federal Reserve signaled its intention to raise interest rates in November 2021  and persisted throughout 2022 as the Fed implemented these adjustments aggressively. 9/ In a lower interest rate environment, it is quite likely crypto yields increase as their negative correlation takes effect and demand picks up for riskier assets.

Key Takeaways
 The value of Bitcoin has undergone remarkable growth since its inception in 2009, soaring by tens of thousands of dollars. Its recent substantial surge is primarily attributed to impending significant institutional developments — Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Nevertheless, this rapid price escalation is regarded with caution, particularly by Peter Schiff, a prominent American economist and vocal crypto skeptic. Schiff firmly believes that the impending introduction of a Bitcoin ETF may open the door to a significant downturn in the cryptocurrency market. Schiff initially recognized  the gradual ascent of Bitcoin toward the $38,000 threshold, attributing this movement to widespread anticipation for the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). #Bitcoin  is approaching $38K as speculators continue to front run a new #BitcoinETF . However, once that ETF is launched all of the speculators will have already bought. So when those buyers sell to take profits, there won't be many left to buy the ETF. Get ready for a crash. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 9, 2023   Notably, the leading digital asset is currently valued  at $37,233, reflecting a 0.8% increase in its value over the past 24 hours. Schiff, known for his anti-Bitcoin stance, said that with the launch of a Bitcoin ETF, many of the current onlookers will have already invested in the cryptocurrency. As these early adopters aim to capitalize on their investments through sales, Schiff anticipates a shortage of buyers for the ETF, potentially resulting in a market crash.

The public urged caution in heeding this prediction, categorizing it as another addition to a list of inaccurate forecasts made by the economist. Despite occasionally facing criticism for his somewhat underwhelming investment-picking track record, Schiff undeniably stands out as one of the most influential figures when it comes to offering investment advice within social networks. Nevertheless, it is evident that the effectiveness of his investment recommendations has gradually diminished over the years. New tweet from Peter? BULLISH! pic.twitter.com/UO9Iy6zasy  — Josh (@CryptoWorldJosh) November 9, 2023   A similar phenomenon is evident with the influential TV host Jim Cramer . Stocks he recommends or criticizes often witness increased trading volumes, influenced by his presence and the perceived impact on other investors. In fact, a phenomenon known as the Inverse Cramer Signal has often times been used to buy stocks said to be going down by Cramer. Originally recognized as a successful hedge fund manager, Cramer transitioned to build a thriving business centered on creating content for investors. In this new role, his primary concern appears to be less about the accuracy of his stock picks and more about appearances and ratings. His current approach seems to prioritize the sensational and controversial aspects of stock picks to boost ratings. While this approach may attract attention and improve ratings, the combination of a high volume of recommendations and a focus on controversy has ultimately resulted in subpar returns. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency experts remain optimistic about the imminent arrival of a spot Bitcoin ETF and its potential to propel the entire crypto market, particularly Bitcoin, to unprecedented levels. Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart  have once again emphasized a strong likelihood, placing a 90% probability, that approvals for Bitcoin ETFs will materialize by January 10.

Speaking during Galaxy Digital’s third-quarter earnings call on November 9, Novogratz underscored the firm’s conviction that approving multiple ETFs is no longer a question of “if” but rather “when.” In Q3 2023, the fund manager, in collaboration with Invesco, submitted applications for spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. November 2023 saw a shift in investor attitude towards bullishness, with well-known ETF research experts projecting that by January 2024, the SEC will have approved 12 significant applications for Bitcoin spot ETFs. “2024 literally is going to be a year of institutional adoption, primarily first through the Bitcoin ETF, which will be followed by an Ethereum ETF,” Novogratz stated during the Q3 earnings call . “As institutions get more comfortable, if the government gives its seal of approval that Bitcoin is a thing, you are going to see the rest of allocators starting to look at things outside of that. And so, money will flow into the space.” Novogratz went on to say  that as investments “in tokenization and wallets” increase, institutional investment may reach a tipping point by 2025. The CEO of Galaxy Digital added that maintaining dollar-backed stablecoins as a vital component of the larger cryptocurrency ecosystem ought to be a top priority for the American market."

Key Takeaways
 Once considered niche and speculative, the cryptocurrency market has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, also gaining attention from big names in the financial world. The influx of institutional investors into the crypto space has played a pivotal role in driving this evolution. Their involvement has not only bestowed legitimacy upon the industry but has also substantially contributed to the expansion of digital assets. Institutional interest is evident as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) surpasses Binance , emerging as the largest Bitcoin futures exchange. Founded in 1848 and currently under the control of CME Group, the American-based CME is a renowned derivatives trading platform primarily serving institutional investors. Despite providing Bitcoin-based futures contracts since 2017, CME Group’s trading volume has consistently lagged behind that of significant cryptocurrency platforms, particularly Binance. But for the first time, the trading volume on the CME has eclipsed that of Binance and other big cryptocurrency exchanges like Bybit and OKX. Data from Coinglass  shows that CME currently has an open interest of 108,900 BTC (approximately $4 billion) in Bitcoin futures contracts. In contrast, Binance holds an open interest of nearly $3.76 billion, equivalent to 102,760 BTC. Most people are optimistic about the approval of the ETF, which is expected in early 2024 but may happen as early as this month, according to some experts. Trading company QCP Capital  further emphasized that a possible spot ETF for Ether was a potential catalyst for the cryptocurrency market’s rise in its most recent market commentary on November 10. “While we expect the approval for a spot BTC ETF to be delayed till Jan 2024, a new narrative surrounding a spot ETH ETF should be enough fuel for animal spirits to take hold once again with crypto prices steadily grinding higher towards the end of the year,” it wrote . One of the most compelling signs that institutional interest has been a major factor driving Bitcoin’s ascent since the start of the quarter is the increase in CME’s open interest. The majority of this interest stems from conjecture over the possible authorization of the first spot Bitcoin ETF with a U.S. basis. 💥Another decision to be made on the Spot #Bitcoin  ETF this week!

The rising support from well-known companies like Fidelity and BlackRock validates Bitcoin as an asset suitable for institutions. As excitement grew, Bitcoin surged to highs of almost $37,900 on Thursday, November 9. At the time of writing, the top cryptocurrency asset is trading at around $36,550 . A “torrent” of institutional money is expected to pour into Bitcoin in the lead-up to an exchange-traded fund (ETF) being approved in the US. Dan Tapiero, the founder and CEO of 10T Holdings, has joined the optimists who predict a dramatic shift in the institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Now begins the renewed drumbeat of ""institutional adoption"" of #Bitcoin    . Real facts driving idea now rather than hope. As CME #btc     futures open interest surpasses Binance in the #1 spot. Torrent of capital from the traditional world about to hit. h/t adi pic.twitter.com/PaoK3InSkx  — Dan Tapiero (@DTAPCAP) November 10, 2023   The price action of BTC has responded in kind to the growing enthusiasm surrounding the possible approval of a U.S. Bitcoin spot price ETF. Meanwhile, institutional tides are beginning to turn as BTC/USD reached 18-month highs. For Tapiero, the fact that CME surpassed Binance represents a turning point. In the meantime, QCP Capital also cautioned  that a sequence of lower highs on Bitcoin’s daily relative strength index (RSI) values could indicate a cooling-off from the next round of highs despite the overall optimistic outlook. The company said that it expects cryptocurrency prices to be sustained because the macro picture is now slightly better in the short term, and rate pause prospects are solid. Quick buys will be made on dips as FOMO traders attempt to board the train. “However, caution is still warranted as we are at crucial resistance levels, and BTC is printing a triple bear divergence with the RSI which has been a reliable signal for momentum stalling,” it concluded . There is a likelihood that governments and regulatory bodies will establish more defined frameworks for the cryptocurrency industry, addressing aspects like taxation, investor protection, and compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. This increased clarity is expected to foster a more stable and secure environment for both cryptocurrency enterprises and investors. Anticipation grows regarding the escalating institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. The evolving landscape, marked by established financial institutions like banks and asset management companies entering the cryptocurrency domain, poses an intriguing prospect for how the industry gains broader legitimacy."

However, when Grayscale attempted to introduce an ETF that would hold direct cryptocurrency assets, the agency rejected the proposal. After a protracted legal struggle in federal court in the United States, a panel of judges concluded that the SEC’s decision was “arbitrary and capricious” and ordered the agency to remove the document. It resubmitted tha application to the regulator after last month court’s ruling finalisation. Chief legal officer of Grayscale, Craig Salm, said, “Right now we’re just laser-focused on constructively reengaging with Trading and Markets,” though he did not elaborate on the specifics of that conversation. “There are still issues that need to be resolved,” Salm stated in an interview. He added that other applicants for Bitcoin ETFs, which include major financial institutions like Fidelity and BlackRock, appeared to be moving forward with their own registrations in SEC discussions. “Overall, it’s been good engagement, and it’s a matter of when, not a matter of if anymore.” Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein stated  the company is still in talks with the SEC about launching a spot-Bitcoin ETF.

But if it comes earlier we are entering a window where a wave of approval orders for all the current applicants *COULD* occur.” Twelve fund managers have applications pending with the SEC, including major players like Grayscale, Ark Invest, and BlackRock.

It will be open for at least eight days. Even if approvals don’t arrive this month, we still believe there’s a 90% chance of approval by January 10.” While approvals are not guaranteed, optimism stems from recent wins in court. In particular, Grayscale’s victory in its lawsuit against the SEC was seen as a turning point, compelling the agency to re-evaluate Grayscale’s application. The regulator had previously denied its attempt to convert GBTC to a ETF. A judge overruled that decision. The SEC had previously approved a futures Bitcoin ETF. If the regulator gives the green-light, these would be the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. he Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange listed Europe’s first-ever spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) back in August. A U.S approval would allow mainstream investors easy exposure to bitcoin without owning the volatile asset directly. It could also boost liquidity and price discovery as ETFs create additional routes for investment. Other spot Bitcoin ETF hopefuls include WisdomTree, Global X, Bitwise, and 21Shares. The pending applications signify the immense appetite for a spot bitcoin ETF product. Yet the SEC continues to drag its feet, frustrating industry insiders. The market awaits a response as the window opened yesterday remains open until at least November 17th, according to the analysts. While Seyffart and Balchunas believe approvals could still come this month, they maintain a high chance of the SEC greenlighting spot bitcoin ETFs by January 10th even if no action is taken in the current window. #Bitcoin  rallies past Terra crash level.

Top 5 Predictions,https://www.ccn.com/news/when-bitcoin-etf-approved/,"The question on every crypto investor’s mind is when will the SEC finally approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)? While the SEC has rejected numerous Bitcoin ETF applications in the past, the prospect of approval seems likelier now as more mainstream financial institutions embrace crypto.  Furthermore, the expectation across the industry is that any approval will make a huge, positive difference to Bitcoin’s price. To get a sense of where the experts are, we gathered predictions from five industry figures on when they think the regulatory gates will finally open for Bitcoin ETFs. According to Thielen , the narrowing discount of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) from -44% to -14% signals the market is confident the SEC will approve a Bitcoin ETF soon. He estimates traders are pricing in an 86% probability of ETF approval based on GBTC‘s shrinking discount. Thielen also notes Bitcoin could surge 10% or more when an ETF is approved, similar to its jump on false rumors of approval in the past. In his view, the most profitable trade will be a deep OTM call option that suddenly becomes ITM around the announcement. Thielen seems to expect approval sometime before January 2024 based on implied volatility trends. The Bernstein managing director and senior analyst, Gautam Chhugani , predicts  the SEC will approve a Bitcoin ETF in Q1 2024. Chhugani sees ETFs from asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity as imminent and hugely bullish for Bitcoin’s valuation. In his view, ETF approval could shift up to 10% of Bitcoin’s supply into ETFs and propel prices as high as $150,000 by 2025— nearly five times Bitcoin’s current price. In early November, Steve McClurg, the Chief Investment Officer of Valkyrie, revealed  that he expects a spot bitcoin ETF approval from the SEC by November 2023. He believes the SEC will issue another round of comments on Valkyrie’s filing within weeks, potentially approving new rule changes by month’s end.  However, McClurg notes the SEC could wait until January 2024 to finalize ETF applications before green-lighting launches in February 2024. Valkyrie is one of the many firms to have applied for their own spot Bitcoin ETF. James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas are one of the most listened-to experts on ETFs, as prominent ETF Research Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence. He predicts  75% odds of ETF approval by the end of 2023, with a decision potentially coming between November 8 and November 21.  He expects the SEC to approve multiple ETFs simultaneously to avoid the perception of favoritism. Seyffart says it’s unlikely the SEC denies the last ETF application on January 10, 2024 and then approves the rest in March, making November to December 2023 the likely window. Back in August, the CEO of Galaxy Digital predicted  at least one spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved within 6 months, so by February 2024 in his estimation. He reiterated  this timeline in October 2023, noting SEC approval could come in December 2023 but trading might not start until 2024. As a crypto insider, Novogratz’s prediction carries significant weight. The expert consensus seems to converge between late 2023 and early 2024 for the long-awaited SEC approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. While uncertainties remain, the momentum clearly seems to be building. With Bitcoin up an impressive 113% so far this year, according to CoinMarketCap , an ETF green light could provide the catalyst for the next major bull run."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Bitcoin in the U.S. Election Race: What Role Will Crypto Play in Deciding Next President?,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-us-election-crypto-next-president/,"
Key Takeaways
 Themes like skepticism toward institutions, economic disparity, and increased financial literacy align closely with the surge of Bitcoin in terms of both its value and widespread adoption. As Bitcoin reaches its peak value during an American Presidential election cycle, particularly appealing to a demographic with a growing distrust of traditional institutions, it raises curiosity about the potential implications of these trends on the upcoming 2024 U.S. Presidential election. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has started taking Bitcoin contributions  for his 2024 reelection campaign. The Republican senator declared: “I am bullish on Bitcoin and I’m proud to accept Bitcoin campaign donations.” I am bullish on bitcoin, and I'm proud to accept bitcoin campaign donations.https://t.co/0j5njATP8M  — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) November 6, 2023   The front page of his official website now features the Bitcoin logo and invites supporters to make cryptocurrency donations. Several presidential contenders declared earlier in the year that they would take Bitcoin donations for their campaigns. Other politicians might very well follow suit if the move proves to be effective. There’s a chance that this will cause attitudes on Capitol Hill to change. The senator is using BitPay, a cryptocurrency payment processor that allows payments in Bitcoin, Ether, BCH, and LTC with the ability to instantly convert to US dollars. This makes him one of Congress’s strongest supporters of cryptocurrencies, especially as Texas is becoming a center for Bitcoin mining as a result of China’s 2021 ban on industrial mining. The Bitcoin phenomenon may be more bipartisan than most people realize, despite the fact that Republicans have been more outspoken in their support of it. Be it as it may, a presidential candidate’s views on Bitcoin  and crypto are important not only because the president leads the country, but also because the President is responsible for appointing the heads of more than 50 independent federal commissions that can influence various aspects of crypto, including the SEC, CFTC, Federal Reserve and Treasury. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand co-sponsored a bill about cryptocurrency. Though it is not a unique instance, this endeavor to legitimise the industry and explain rules in the summer of 2022 finally failed. An essay titled “A liberal case for cryptocurrency ” was written in 2022 by Representative Ritchie Torres, for instance. His piece focused on helping the underprivileged and shifting Wall Street’s power dynamics. A few months prior, the article was the result of a legislative endeavor to provide clarification on cryptocurrency exchanges. Even at the most recent Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami earlier this year, several lawmakers with varying political affiliations gave speeches. Robert Kennedy, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Tulsi Gabbard—past and present presidential contenders—were among the featured speakers. Even with the bipartisan support for Bitcoin, the Biden Administration’s push for a central bank digital currency has not convinced many politicians. Ted Cruz mentioned the increasing significance of Bitcoin in a recent audio interview about CBDCs that is available to listen to below. Biden Admin Urges Israel to STOPKilling Terrorists, Dems Smear Justice Thomas, and School Choice—the Civil Rights Issue of the 21st Century. @benfergusonshow  and I discuss all this and more on this morning’s new episode of Verdict. Don’t miss it!https://t.co/zSt10lQMrs  — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) November 6, 2023   Cruz seems to be thinking of CBDCs as an extension of the failed initiatives that led to the creation of the Build Back Better law under the Biden administration. During the interview, he stated that Build Back Better would have mandated that banks notify the government of any transaction above $400. Cruz is mostly worried about the extent of monitoring and control that CBDCs would permit. He concluded that “the federal government has no business monitoring the financial transactions of a free people.” According to the CATO institute, 74% of Americans are against using CBDCs in place of dollars. Support for Bitcoin may increase as a result of people’s opposition to CBDCs and their desire to elude increasing financial control. Following the 2021 election season, mayors of Miami and New York City, representing opposing political parties, decided to accept Bitcoin as payment  for their salaries. Several other mayors were spurred to follow suit by this trend. Two additional mayors have followed suit after Miami Mayor, Francis Suarez, and New York City Mayor, Eric Adams, declared they would accept their future paychecks in Bitcoin. Jane Castor of Tampa, Florida, and Scott Conger of Jackson, Tennessee, have similar plans for their next city payment. A group of politicians are attempting to establish their towns as genuine Bitcoin hubs in the United States as a result of game theory, which is increasing the rate and volume of mayors converting their payments into Bitcoin. While state law prohibits the @CityofJacksonTN  from paying me in Bitcoin, I’ll follow the lead of @FrancisSuarez  & @ericadamsfornyc  and instantly convert my next paycheck to #Bitcoin  — Mayor Scott Conger (@MayorConger) November 5, 2021   According to the mayor, everyone can receive payment in Bitcoin; all they need to do is purchase Bitcoin with their entire wage as soon as it arrives. Since Tennessee law prohibits the city of Jackson from paying him directly in Bitcoin, he can still convert his wage into Bitcoin. The Mayor of Tampa likewise expressed her readiness to embrace the same approach, indicating her willingness to join the group of U.S. mayors receiving their payments in Bitcoin. Apologies for coming late to the conversation – we've been busy preparing for today's cryptocurrency conference here in the @CityofTampa . 🪙😏 But I'm certainly up for the challenge! #ForbesTopEmergingTechnologyCity  #FloridasTechCapitol  #TechTown  — Jane Castor (@JaneCastor) November 5, 2021   Proponents like Cruz anticipate that more lawmakers will join the battle to support Bitcoin as more people start to recognizeBitcoin its worth in the face of this escalating threat. Washington might hold onto its unyielding beliefs up until that point. As Bitcoin continues to gain prominence and considering the importance of the young voter demographic, it will be intriguing to observe how presidential candidates’ positions on cryptocurrency develop and whether they will have an impact on the 2024 American Presidential election. It is crucial to closely monitor this, as the legal framework, policies, and regulations will hold significant consequences for the cryptocurrency as an asset class, America’s position in the global economy, and the future of finance."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Bitcoin Price Rise Does Not Impress Berkshire Hathaway’s Charlie Munger,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-rise-berkshire-hathaways-charlie-munger/,"
Key Takeaways
 Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and a close associate of Warren Buffett, expressed alarm as the price of Bitcoin increased. In his recent interview , Charlie Munger, the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, again made fun of Bitcoin referring to it as a ‘stink ball’. Whether the 99-year-old is concerned about the recent spike in the price of Bitcoin was one of the queries presented to him. When discussing the development of a cryptocurrency, the executive stated : “Of course, it concerns me. I have a lot of very simple fundamental ideas that I think every educated person ought to have. Those ideas include what Adam Smith taught everybody … In order to get the Smithian results, you need a currency to facilitate exchanges. And to make the currency respected widely, the trick we’ve used is the sovereign issues it,” Munger added . Charlie Munger Sees #Bitcoin  as a Stink Ball: “When you start creating an artificial currency, you’re throwing your stink ball into a recipe that’s been around for a long time, that’s worked very well for a lot of people,” the executive said.#bitcoin  @Bitcoin  pic.twitter.com/F0U0VEppyh  — Quang Avenue (@Quang22758929) November 6, 2023   Munger further stated that the historical transition from hunter-gathering societies to civilizations has consistently involved the presence of a robust currency, which could take various forms, such as seashells, corn kernels, gold coins, or even the promises embedded in modern banking systems found in countries like the United States and England. He said : “When you start creating an artificial currency…you’re throwing your stink ball into a recipe that’s been around for a long time, that’s worked very well for a lot of people.” Munger has consistently expressed strong opposition to cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. Last month, the Berkshire executive issued a caution that the majority of crypto investments would eventually become worthless, describing Bitcoin as the most ill-advised investment he had ever encountered. In earlier instances, he referred to BTC as “rat poison ” and compared its trading to dealing in undesirable assets. In February, he sharply criticized it, deeming the idea of buying such assets as ludicrous and deplorable. He expressed embarrassment that a significant number of people in his country believed in cryptocurrencies, and he criticized the government for permitting their existence. In July of the previous year, he went further by stating his aversion  to cryptocurrencies and advising others to avoid them as if they were hazardous. He also likened cryptocurrencies to a contagious disease and called for government interventions to prohibit their use. He even expressed regret that cryptocurrencies were ever introduced, labeling their development as a repugnant and counterproductive aspect of civilization. Given his close association with Warren Buffett, it’s unsurprising that Munger holds a negative stance on cryptocurrencies. Warren Buffett, the renowned billionaire investor, has long been an outspoken critic of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies amid a perceived US “battle” against Bitcoin. Nevertheless, in light of a looming crisis that threatens the US dollar, a recent analysis of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway stock portfolio has unveiled that his most successful investment in the current year is Nubank . Nubank is a fintech company with a proclivity for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This video really puts into perspective of why we have 2 year bear markets. Like stocks, the people with 90% of the money in crypto want to buy the coins low, and lower the next year. Then it rips. ""If People weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.""-Charlie Munger pic.twitter.com/exMKuyP5fY  — ⟠ 𓃓 ∞ ₿ullish ₳lex (@AlexjFerraro) November 5, 2023   Back in June 2021, Berkshire Hathaway, under Buffett’s guidance, made a substantial $500 million investment  in Brazil’s Nubank. This was before to the company’s initial public offering (IPO) later that same year. Buffett’s stake in Nubank has now appreciated to approximately $840 million. It followed an additional $250 million infusion into the fintech firm during its IPO. Nubank, a financial institution that permits users to engage in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency trading and recently introduced its own digital currency called “Nucoin,” has witnessed its stock price surge by over 100% in the current year. This impressive growth has been driven by a substantial increase in revenue and a growing customer base. Warren Buffet: ""Bitcoin is rat poison.""  Charlie Munger: ""I think the whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization. Of course, I hate the bitcoin success"" Though they didn't directly invest in Bitcoin but they do know where the 💰💰 is. pic.twitter.com/tEmkBiPZtB  — oddgems ⋈ (@oddgems) June 16, 2021   Buffett has previously characterized  Bitcoin as “rat poison squared,” deeming it a valueless fantasy. On the other hand, Munger has drawn parallels between cryptocurrencies and contagious diseases. He advocated for a US ban on them and expressed disapproval of the extensive speculation driving their recent price surges. Regardless of the situation, the swift advancements and the profound transition from a profit-driven orientation to a more altruistic perspective promise to liberate the world from the dominance of large corporations. The reality is that the traditional leaders in the industry responsible for the ongoing sustainability challenges are expressing their dismay at something they neither comprehend nor manage. Nevertheless, the majority of rapid innovations are unfolding within the realm of cryptocurrencies, leaving us to ponder whether the skepticism of the Buffett-Munger duo towards Bitcoin will endure."

Key Takeaways
 The realm of “pig butchering” investment scams has extended to the sanctioned app platforms of Google and Apple. According to  cryptocurrency investigator ZachXBT, customers who downloaded a fraudulent Ledger Live app from Microsoft‘s app store had about $600,000 in Bitcoin taken from them. On November 5, the on-chain researcher discovered the fraud known as “Ledger Live Web3.” It deceives people into believing that they are installing “Ledger Live,” which is a user interface for offline cryptocurrency storage on Ledger hardware wallets. The scammer has received over 16.8 BTC worth $588,00 throughout 38 transactions using the wallet address “bc1q.y64q,” according to Blockchain.com . After two transfers totaling about $115,200, the scammer’s wallet now has $473,800, or 13.5 BTC, in it. Community Alert: There is currently a fake @Ledger  Live app on the official @Microsoft  App Store which was resulted in 16.8+ BTC ($588K) stolen Scammer addressbc1qg05gw43elzqxqnll8vs8x47ukkhudwyncxy64q pic.twitter.com/rOZ0ZWRWbn  — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) November 5, 2023   
ZachXBT mentioned in a follow-up post  that Microsoft might have taken down the phoney Ledger Live app from its store.
On October 24, $5,210 went to the wallet address of the scammer. The wallet had not been used before that. The majority of these transactions have taken place since November 2, with the highest transfer on November 4 being $81,200.
It appears that on October 19, the phoney “Ledger Live Web3” application first surfaced in Microsoft’s app store.

ZachXBT even asserted that Microsoft “should be held liable” for permitting the fraudulent Ledger Live software to exist in its app store, claiming to have received two messages from victims on November 4.


Wow that’s insane :(

Microsoft’s spokesperson told CCN the company has removed this application and “is continually working to ensure malicious content is identified and taken down quickly”.
A “Known” Offender
Additionally, this is not the first time a phoney Ledger Live app has entered Microsoft’s app store.
Two different times, in December and March, Ledger’s help account on X (previously Twitter) alerted users to the existence of a phoney Ledger Live app.


🚨 Hey #ledger  users
Beware of fake Ledger Live apps published on the Microsoft Store👀
The only safe place to download Ledger Live is on our website👇https://t.co/cDLX1rEWPf

Stay safe 🙏 pic.twitter.com/0dXTJ7FeuO 
— Ledger Support (@Ledger_Support) December 26, 2022 

Ledger has not yet responded to the fraud, but in the past, it has reminded customers that downloading Ledger Live from its website, ledger.com, is the “only safe place.”
In May this year, it happened the launch of a so-called Ledger Recover. The cryptocurrency industry fiercely opposed a new service that lets users of the Ledger hardware wallet backup their secret recovery phrases. Co-founder and former CEO of Ledger, Éric Larchevêque, described  Ledger’s detractors as “a total PR failure, but absolutely not a technical one.”
In response to growing worries from users across the globe, Larchevêque made a clarification post on Reddit , stating that Ledger was never a reliable solution:
“Some amount of trust must be placed into Ledger to use their product. If you don’t trust Ledger, meaning you treat your HW manufacturer as an adversary, that can’t work at all.”
AI Chat & Fake Investments Scams
According to Sophos’ findings,  a portion of swindles involving fraudulent cryptocurrency investments have been targeting users of dating apps. These CryptoRom scammers have been perfecting their methods since May, with Sophos X-Ops noting the addition of an AI chat tool similar to ChatGPT in their arsenal.
Additionally, these fraudsters have broadened their coercive tactics, falsely claiming that victims’ cryptocurrency accounts were compromised and demanding larger upfront payments.

Software developers use the same method that Sophos initially reported  in February 2023 to get past the Apple software Store review procedure. They use authentic, everyday web content when they submit the app for approval. They then add a code for the bogus interface to the server hosting the app after its authorisation and publication.

The same templates and descriptions appeared in many of these seven new apps. This indicates that the same ring or rings of pig butchers are behind the whole scam.
According to Sophos, the emergence of FinTech has made people’s faith in software tools more commonplace. This trust increases when consumers download programmes from the official Google and Apple shops.
The greatest defence is to learn about the software before downloading it, read user reviews, review the privacy statement, and confirm the developer/publisher and corporate information.

2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Bitcoin a Decade Long Hodl: Cathie Wood’s Reasons for Backing BTC Over Everything,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-hodl-woods-favors-btc-over-everything/,"
Key Takeaways
 In the last ten years, Bitcoin has surged into the limelight as the leading cryptocurrency. During this journey, various narratives have emerged to support the notion of investing in Bitcoin. One such narrative compares it to “digital gold” because, akin to gold, it can function as a means of preserving value and serve as a safeguard against inflation. To hedge against the risk of deflation in the upcoming ten years, Cathie Wood says  she would categorically bet on Bitcoin rather than gold or cash. Even as markets have focused on a new era of heightened inflation risks, the head of ARK Investment Management reiterated her view that she expects an era of falling prices, supported by new technologies like robotics, electric vehicles, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and genomic sequencing. She has held this opinion since 2021. So, why is US employment still so strong, supporting the government’s point of view? In our view, labor hoarding after two years of vacancies is a reason on the demand side, while loss of purchasing power – especially food and energy – is a reason on the supply side, BUT… — Cathie Wood (@CathieDWood) October 26, 2023   When asked which of the three asset classes she would pick to hold for ten years, Wood responded , “Bitcoin, hands down.” Due to its little involvement from institutions and lack of counterparty risk, bitcoin is a hedge against both inflation and deflation. “Digital gold,” as she put it. Wood has been one of the more upbeat commentators on cryptocurrencies. She believies that they will gain from the broader advancements and expansion of new technology. She had before forecast that within the next ten years, the price of Bitcoin would surpass $1 million . It is currently $35,000, or around half of its peak in 2021. Don’t be surprised when #Bitcoin  goes to $1 million post spot ETF approval. Market cap doesn’t increase linearly ($1 BTC buy doesn’t make market cap go up $1), there’s a multiplier effect. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) November 1, 2023   Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s value has more than doubled this year after plunging 64% in 2022 as a result of market participants praising it as a possible inflation hedge, even though it did not function as one amid the largest consumer price spike since the early 1980s. The US Securities and Exchange Commission may soon authorise exchange-traded funds that invest directly in the coin, according to recent bets, which have caused the token to surge. Wood is one of the people most likely to gain from ETF approvals. Her company has invested in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and submitted an application for a Bitcoin ETF with 21Shares. GBTC was purchased by Wood’s $1.2 billion ARK Next Generation Internet ETF in November of last year, at a roughly 40% discount. The trust, which is the fund’s largest position, has returned over 224% so far this year as of Wednesday. In comparison, the rise in Bitcoin is about 114%. Last month, ARK sold a portion of its GBTC assets. Wood stated on the programme that she anticipates a convergence between Bitcoin and AI. This is “going to enable a division of labour and microtasks globally in a way we can’t even imagine now.” …if we are right that prices are about to unravel and crush margins, then companies will be forced not only to lay off excess labor but also to harness AI and other automation to salvage margins. Innovation solves problems and gains traction during tough times! — Cathie Wood (@CathieDWood) October 26, 2023   Peter Schiff, a prominent advocate for gold investments, recently shared his views on the current state of Bitcoin trading and the potential consequences of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighting a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Schiff cautioned that any discussions regarding ETF approval could potentially signify the pinnacle of the Bitcoin uptrend. He stated : “Bitcoin is currently priced at $35K, with speculators placing their bets on the SEC’s approval of GBTC transforming into an ETF. If such talks occur, it is likely to mark the peak of the rally, unless Bitcoin experiences a decline before approval. The magnitude of the decline will be less significant if the ETF conversion is once again denied.” Schiff warned  Bitcoin investors in another X post about the possible dangers and traps that could arise, especially in light of the recent excitement surrounding the creation of a Bitcoin ETF. Speculators are buying #Bitcoin  now because they think other speculators are waiting to buy a #BitcoinETF . They will soon discover that there are far more speculators waiting to sell then waiting to buy! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) October 23, 2023   The question of whether Bitcoin will eventually replace gold as the ultimate store of value may not be entirely fitting, as there’s a likelihood that both can and will coexist as complementary assets. Just as it’s customary in various investment sectors, the Bitcoin versus gold choice will ultimately depend on the individual investor’s risk profile. When it comes to constructing a well-balanced portfolio, diversification is key. It involves holding a variety of assets that may not necessarily exhibit correlated movements. Bitcoin, akin to gold, has emerged as an alternative investment choice for certain investors, offering a spectrum of potential applications. Its viability as an investment hinges on employing a suitable strategy. The better choice between the two depends on factors such as risk tolerance, investing approach, available capital, and capacity to withstand potential losses. Bitcoin’s significantly higher volatility in comparison to gold renders it a riskier investment option."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,"Bitcoin Price has 71% Chance of a ‘Santa Rally’ to $56,000",https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-high-chance-of-santa-rally-56000/,"
Key Takeaways
 A well-known adage on Wall Street is that unless there is an outside influence, a bull market will often continue to go forward. According to  crypto services company Matrixport, Bitcoin has historically lived up to the proverb based on Sir Isaac Newton’s third law of motion and may do so once more, reaching as high as $56,000 by the end of the year. Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, wrote a note  to clients on Thursday that stated: “If Bitcoin is up at least +100% by this time of the year, then there is a +71% chance or five in seven that Bitcoin would finish the year higher with average year-end rallies of +65%.” “We could call the six to seven weeks from early November to mid-December Bitcoin’s Santa Claus Rally, as the cryptocurrency typically reaches its peak by December 18th.” Currently trading over $35,000, Bitcoin has increased by 114% year to date as of this writing. The remarkable increase may be explained by a number of factors, such as haven demand, spot ETF optimism, and theories that the Federal Reserve’s cycle of liquidity tightening has peaked. Bitcoin is up more than 100% to start the year. I joined @SquawkCNBC  this morning to discuss why investors are interested in the decentralized currency amid the chaos and uncertainty of the modern world. pic.twitter.com/rUNy9oAT8u  — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) October 25, 2023   By year’s end, Bitcoin might trade above $65,000 thanks to the anticipated 65% price increase. Thielen added that, considering these statistics, Bitcoin still presents an opportunity for upward growth, with the potential for a year-end rally of +65% that would bring prices to $56,000. The graph displays Bitcoin’s historical performance for the first ten and last two months of each year between 2010 and 2022. Bitcoin has gained at least 100% in the first ten months in seven of the last twelve years. In the last eight weeks, Bitcoin has increased in value by an average of 65% over the past seven years. “When Bitcoin is up at least by 50% by the end of October, there is, on average, a 78% chance that Bitcoin will advance even more into year-end. Bitcoin rallied by another 68% until year-end on seven of nine previous occasions. This analysis is based on thirteen years of bitcoin history,” Thielen stated. It’s important to emphasize that while historical data can provide insights, it doesn’t guarantee future outcomes. However, the likelihood of history repeating itself remains significant, particularly in anticipation of the upcoming bullish mining reward halving scheduled for early next year. Furthermore, it seems that the US Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain interest rates between 5.25% to 5.5% validated the market’s optimistic attitude that has prevailed since October. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, reaffirmed the bank’s “strong commitment” to reducing inflation. Powell stated  during the meeting that recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a strong pace – well above earlier expectations. While maintaining a restrictive monetary policy for the foreseeable future, the majority of committee members think that another rate hike is necessary before the year ends. After the FOMC meeting, the price of Bitcoin started to rise again, rising beyond $35,000 to trade at a record high for the year. BTC is currently trading at $35,383, up by 3.3% over the previous day."

Key Takeaways
 Bitcoin, which is frequently referred to as “digital gold,” now has a billionaire hedge fund investor named Stanley Druckenmiller as a prominent supporter. In an interview  with fellow hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, Druckenmiller – who oversaw George Soros’s investments in the 1990s – admitted that he does not now own Bitcoin, and it may have been an error selling them. Recently, billionaire Stan Druckenmiller praised Bitcoin for creating a “brand” during the last fifteen years. In a 30-minute interview , the legendary 70-year-old Wall Street man made a comparison between Bitcoin and gold, which has long been regarded as a reliable store of value. Pointing out the obvious distinction between the two, he said that he owned gold because “it’s a 5,000-year-old brand.” He also noted that younger people are becoming more and more inclined to favor Bitcoin as a store of value since it is more convenient and effective to interact with. Stanley Druckenmiller is one of the most successful hedge fund managers on Wall Street and is worth $6,200,000,000. He says, “Young people look at #bitcoin  as a store of value. It’s a brand. I like it. I dont own any, but I should”pic.twitter.com/DXjrnvE1Qc  — Documenting ₿itcoin 📄 (@DocumentingBTC) October 30, 2023   Even though Druckenmiller acknowledged the value of Bitcoin, he admitted that he currently lacked any of the cryptocurrency but made a suggestion that he might own some in the near future. “To be honest, I don’t hold any Bitcoin, but I really should,” he said. The statements  Druckenmiller made recently stand in sharp contrast to those he made earlier in a late 2020 CNBC interview. On that occasion, he acknowledged  owning Bitcoin but said that his holdings in gold were “many, many more times” higher than his allocation to the cryptocurrency. In a September 2022 interview, he disclosed  that he had sold his Bitcoin following tightening measures implemented by central banks. Druckenmiller, citing the Bank of England following the British pound’s decline in mid-2022, asserted that the cryptocurrency sector would thrive if public confidence in the central banking system wanes. Overled the past year, Wall Street corporations’ sentiment towards the leading cryptocurrency has improved. This is evident in the multitude of Bitcoin ETFs applications that these major financial institutions have submitted. Druckenmiller has FOMO while Bitcoin may print a bullish engulfing 2M candle and lead into a green November.

Key Takeaways
 Significant advancements have been made by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in the realm of Bitcoin futures and perpetual futures, according to latest figures,. In fact, its notional open interest (OI) has surged recently, solidifying its position as the second-highest  among exchanges that provide both normal Bitcoin and perpetual futures.  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a regulated institution, is making significant strides in becoming one of the leading exchanges for Bitcoin (BTC) futures and perpetual futures trading when it comes to open interest. This development brings to mind the early stages of the 2020-2021 bull market.  As reported by Coinglass , CME has observed a substantial increase in its notional open interest (OI), reaching $3.57 billion. This surge has propelled it to the position of the second-largest exchange for Bitcoin futures, a remarkable shift from its previous rank, which was fourth, just a few weeks ago.  Notional open interest refers to the US dollar value associated with the quantity of active or open contracts. In comparison, Binance, an unregulated offshore exchange, continues to maintain its dominance in the market with a notional open interest of $3.85 billion, which is approximately 8% higher than CME‘s.  In a remarkable development, the open interest on CME’s cash-settled futures contracts has surged  past the 100,000 BTC mark, marking the first time it has reached such heights. Additionally, CME has achieved an unprecedented 25% market share in the Bitcoin futures industry.  CME provides a range of Bitcoin futures contracts, including standard contracts with a value of five bitcoins each, as well as micro contracts representing fractions of a bitcoin. Furthermore, they offer micro futures tied to tenths of an ETH (Ethereum) and ether futures with a contract size of fifty ETH.  Notably, the majority of open interest on offshore exchanges is attributed to perpetual futures, distinctive for their absence of an expiration date and use of a funding rate mechanism to align with the current spot price.  Observers of the market are speculating  that CME’s recent expansion may signal a surge in institutional interest in Bitcoin.   This @Glassnode  chart only highlights on-chain #Bitcoin  trading activity, but it misses the big institutional action happening off-chain on the BTC futures markets. CME BTC futures OI just touched 100k BTC ($3.4 Billion USD) with a 25% market share, rapidly approaching Binance… https://t.co/opZ7wJEOFg  pic.twitter.com/SOj577riFz  — Leon Waidmann | On-Chain Insights🔍 (@LeonWaidmann) October 24, 2023   This month, Bitcoin has seen a 27% increase in value, driven by gains in spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and heightened macroeconomic uncertainties.  The rise in Bitcoin’s appeal has also been influenced by individual investors. Data from Matrixport reveals  that the rolling five-day volume of the leading Bitcoin futures ETF offered by ProShares experienced a staggering 420% surge, reaching $340 million last week. It’s important to note that the primary asset class of this ETF consists of CME Bitcoin futures.    An alternative viewpoint is by Deutsche Digital Assets’ head of research, André Dragosch. He contends that the unwinding of negative bets on offshore exchanges, as opposed to an increase in long futures positions, is more likely to be the cause of CME’s expansion.  This take doesn't make sense. CME's share in $BTC  futures OI might have increased relative to other exchanges but the aggregate amount of BTC futures & perps OI has not increased in BTC terms, implying that long futures positions were not the main driver behind the recent… https://t.co/9y6xAcmvzn  pic.twitter.com/imHZNib4ls  — André Dragosch | Bitcoin & Macro ⚡ (@Andre_Dragosch) October 24, 2023   Dragosch said that while CME’s portion of the open interest in Bitcoin futures has increased, there hasn’t been a noticeable increase in the total quantity of Bitcoin futures and perpetual open interest in terms of Bitcoin terms.  This implies that a short squeeze and a decline in total open interest may be more responsible for the current price spike.  The possible approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF is another exciting development that has raised the price of Bitcoin in the market. Due in large part to market conjecture on the spot ETF, Bitcoin experienced a surge towards the $35,000 mark earlier this month.  CME BTC futures OI has breached 100k BTC for the first time ever. While offshore perp OI shrank by 26,735 BTC yesterday, CME's OI grew by 4,380 BTC. pic.twitter.com/kjKBRYCoSX  — Vetle Lunde (@VetleLunde) October 24, 2023   Simultaneously, the price of Bitcoin has increased by 13%, surpassing that of Ethereum, for a future month. This shows that a growing number of people—particularly large investors—want Bitcoin futures. "

Key Takeaways
 It is no secret that the US government is one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world, with its stash valued at over $6.7 billion. However, it seems the US Government has seized and sold  over 195,000 BTC since 2014. Just how much better off they would have fared had they decided to HODL? The United States has primarily dealt with monitoring and seizing cryptocurrencies—which were created to elude law enforcement—by utilizing antiquated crime-fighting techniques. 🐋The US government emerges as one of the biggest #Bitcoin  whales, holding a staggering $5.5 billion in crypto from seizures! How it handles this digital treasure could sway the market, as crypto trading volumes simmer. Will they HODL or sell? 🤔💱 #CryptoCuriosity  #WhaleWatching  pic.twitter.com/dXA7A2mhJp  — Crypto Gurru (@cryptogurru7) October 21, 2023   The transit of Bitcoin and other cryptos through the American criminal court system currently has three major intersections. The search and seizure phase  is the first. The second is the clearing of crypto that has been raided. The third is using the money that was raised from the cryptocurrency sales. To guarantee adequate supervision, several agents are involved during the actual seizure. This includes managers who set up the hardware wallets required to safeguard the cryptocurrency that has been confiscated. Government crypto coffers are predicted to rise even higher as cybercrime increases and the haul of digital tokens rises with it. The U.S. Marshals Service  is the primary organization in charge of auctioning off the government’s cryptocurrency assets after a case is closed. More than 195,000 Bitcoins have been confiscated and put up for sale thus far. While many of the coins were sold in batches far below today’s market, the hoard of coins is currently valued at over $6.7 billion. However, just a year ago, its value was around $8.6 billion  and there were 10,000 Bitcoin less confiscated. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) carried out the most significant Silk Road seizure in 2020. Following the government’s successful tracking of assets taken from the site before it was shut down, the IRS took possession of 69,369 BTC from an anonymous hacker on the Silk Road. James Zhong  was caught by authorities one year later with a further 51,326 BTC. Zhong had been embezzling the money from the market between 2012 and 2014. The majority of the government’s Bitcoin stockpile is stored offline in hardware wallets, which are encrypted storage devices managed by the Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department . But occasionally, the US government also uses an auction system to sell some of the Bitcoin that has been confiscated in accordance with court liquidation orders. The feds divide the loot after a case is closed and the cryptocurrency has been converted to fiat money. One of two accounts—the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund or the Treasury Forfeiture Fund —usually receives the sale’s revenues. Once deposited into one of these two funds, the liquidated cryptocurrency can be used for multiple line items. Congress has the authority to withhold the funds and allocate them to alternative initiatives. The government sold 9,861.2 BTC on March 14 for around $21,800 for each token. On this date, Bitcoin was trading at a high of about $26,500 and a low of about $24,000 on the majority of exchanges. According to court records, transaction fees for the sale cost government representatives more than $215,000. The remaining 41,500 BTC ($1.2 billion) will be sold this year in four phases, according to the officials. It was not specified how the sale was made. The US has previously auctioned off crypto that was seized. Venture entrepreneur Tim Draper received  over 30,000 BTC in 2014 from officials, which were also seized in connection with Silk Road.

More than $5 billion, according to a dashboard monitoring US government bitcoin auctions, has been lost by early Bitcoin sales. It appears that the US Government did not believe that Bitcoin could have reached the levels it has done. Back in 2014, when the crypto market was still in its infancy, that was a not-unreasonable assumption. However, had the government been a little less gung-ho about selling BTC, they could have turned a profit which would have helped American citizens to the tune of almost $6.8 billion ."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Top Bitcoin Price Predictions After SEC Approves BTC ETF,https://www.ccn.com/news/top-bitcoin-price-predictions-sec-approves-btc-etf/,"For months now, the crypto markets have been eagerly waiting for news that the Securities and Exchange Commission has approved a spot Bitcoin ETF. A false news story on October 16 has already sent markets into a frenzy. We’ve collected five of the most interesting predictions for Bitcoin’s price if that scenario happens—analysts at Bloomberg  put the chances at over 90%. (Spoiler alert: nobody is expecting the price to go down, at least.) Cryptocurrency services provider Matrixport believes Bitcoin could surge to $56,000 if a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved by the SEC. In a recent report, Matrixport said Bitcoin hitting $42,000 would be a conservative estimate based on 10-20% of gold ETF investors diversifying into Bitcoin.  With over $200 billion invested in gold ETFs, even 10% flowing into Bitcoin could bring $12-24 billion into a Bitcoin ETF. Matrixport notes the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust hit $44 billion assets under management at its peak, so $12-24 billion inflows seem reasonable.  The approval of a #Bitcoin  ETF is set to trigger a massive $24-50 billion influx of fiat currency. ‘Matrix on Target’ predicted this based on favorable economic conditions, and #GBTC  has already surged by 167% year-to-date. #BlackRock ’s ETF application in June 2023 is a… pic.twitter.com/5U1N2aLK3v  — Matrixport (@realMatrixport) October 20, 2023   Additionally, Matrixport says the 15,000 registered investment advisors overseeing $5 trillion in assets have huge potential for Bitcoin. Even a modest 1% Bitcoin allocation recommendation from RIAs could bring $50 billion into Bitcoin and push its price to $56,000. Known for his incisive breakdowns of the crypto markets, Lark Davis educates his millions of followers on major crypto trends while providing price predictions for Bitcoin and altcoins.  In a recent interview, Davis, a former teacher, said he believed Bitcoin could hit $48,000  in 2023 if a spot ETF is approved. While not predicting new all-time highs this year, Davis says $48,000 is a bull case for Bitcoin by Christmas if the ETF goes through.  Longer term, Davis sees Bitcoin surpassing $100,000 and potentially reaching $150,000 by the 2024-2025 cycle peak.  According to Fundstrat’s head of research Tom Lee, Bitcoin could explode above $150,000 by the end of 2024, if several spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved in the US.  Citing the shifting supply-demand dynamics, Lee believes  ETF demand would outstrip Bitcoin’s daily supply, pushing its price over $150,000, potentially as high as $180,000. Lee notes Europe already has spot Bitcoin ETFs trading, so US-approved ETFs would have an outsized impact on price.  According to Ernst & Young’s global blockchain leader Paul Brody, Bitcoin is facing massive pent-up demand from institutional investors awaiting SEC approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.  In a recent CNBC interview , Brody explained trillions of institutional dollars are waiting on the sidelines to buy Bitcoin through an ETF or other regulated investment vehicle.  While retail investors are purchasing Bitcoin as an asset, institutions cannot access crypto markets until regulatory barriers are removed. However, Brody believes institutions see Bitcoin as an investment asset, not a payment network like Ethereum.  Once institutions can invest in Bitcoin through an ETF, Brody expects a flood of new demand that could significantly push up Bitcoin’s price, with billions in institutional capital to finally enter the Bitcoin market after years of restrictive barriers.  Whilst not a precise prediction, EY’s analysis provides yet another reason to feel bullish on Bitcoin. Crypto analyst Alex Krüger, co-founder of Asgard Markets, predicts daily +20% moves in the price of Bitcoin if the SEC gets around to approving a spot Bitcoin ETF. One thing is for sure. Whoever thinks the ETF is already priced in has just been proven wrong. Expect a +20% day move when approved. — Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) October 16, 2023   In an October 16 post on X  (formerly Twitter), Krüger noted the strong market reaction to ETF applications shows the approval is not fully priced in yet. He believes a 20%+ single-day gain is likely when a Bitcoin spot ETF gets the green light from the SEC. If one were approved today, that would put BTC at approximately $41,700. When the fake news broke that the SEC had approved BlackRock’s iShares spot Bitcoin ETF, the price from $27,962 to $29,388 within minutes of the story breaking. The equivalent of just over 5%. So, Krüger expects the actual news to make much bigger waves. One thing you have to say about Tim Draper, the eccentric investor, is that he’s consistent. Draper has been extolling the virtues and benefits of Bitcoin for years, having held the coin since at least 2014 after buying  30,000 BTC following the collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange.  In more recent years, Draper has predicted again and again that Bitcoin will reach $250,000, first making the prediction in 2018 . After failing to hit the mark in 2022, Draper then updated his prediction to June 2023. In an interview with Bloomberg TV  to explain his failed forecast, he “wasn’t really expecting for the U.S. bureaucracy to be this aggressive.” Oops! I predicted $250k in 2022. My tweet last night was missing a zero. $250k is the number! — Tim Draper (@TimDraper) April 13, 2018   Draper is now, once again, predicting “maybe two years” until it reaches that magic number. Unless something major happens, we’ll almost certainly have a spot Bitcoin ETF in place. If we get there, the ETF would certainly have helped. Cathie Wood, founder of ARK Invest, knows a thing or two about spot Bitcoin ETFs, having applied for one herself. The ARK Invest and 21 Shares’ joint spot Bitcoin ETF is one of at least 10 currently waiting for approval from the SEC. More recently, ARK filed the first spot ETF for ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Need some hopium? Cathie Wood prediction for Bitcoin: Base case: $625kBull case: $1.5mpic.twitter.com/VsO7ZS00LS  — Mando (@rektmando) July 18, 2023   During a recent interview on Coin Stories, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood was asked by Natalie Brunell to expand on her firm’s research predicting a $1.48 million Bitcoin price by 2030. Brunell presented three potential scenarios: a bear case of $258,000, a base case of $682,000, and a bullish projection of $1.48 million. Wood explained one of the primary factors shaping these projections was increasing institutional adoption. Well, a spot Bitcoin ETF would certainly help."
2024-04-11 14:24:00+00:00,How Bitcoin and Big Crypto Cap ETFs Could Kill Off Exchanges,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-and-big-crypto-cap-etfs-could-kill-off-crypto-exchanges/,"A much anticipated spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will undoubtedly be good news for investors and traders, providing more security and flexibility. But, there is an underappreciated downside for some of the industry’s biggest players. A flood of new large capitalization crypto ETFs could spell trouble for cryptocurrency exchanges. As Robert Quartly-Janeiro, Chief Strategy Officer at crypto exchange Bitrue , explains, these ETFs offer customers convenience, lower costs, and high liquidity. Can the big crypto exchanges compete with such an offer? A cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund allows investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency prices without directly holding the asset, offering convenience and liquidity through traditional brokerage accounts. So far, only futures-based Bitcoin ETFs, and Ether futures ETFs are available. However, there are over 10 spot Bitcoin ETF applications currently outstanding, with industry experts widely predicting an imminent approval. Canada  and the EU already have their own spot Bitcoin ETFs. Quartly-Janeiro notes to CCN that if investors can access the major cryptocurrencies through ETFs in one place cheaply, then “why wouldn’t you?” In his view, exchanges would struggle to compete against “huge asset managers, some of which are several times larger than G10 economies.” The migration of users would likely be gradual, but could accelerate if no compelling reasons remain to stay on exchanges. “It’s the reason why people use certain supermarkets; convenience, price, and choice,” explained Quartly-Janeiro. To stay competitive, exchanges need to take action.  Quartly-Janeiro advises they should increase transparency, leverage their established user base, expand offerings, pursue growth, engage in [mergers and acquisitions] activity, build international brands, and aggressively enter new markets. The goal, he said, is to ensure individuals and institutions alike view them as viable options. Whilst markets are abuzz with excitement, additional spot ETFs beyond Bitcoin could be a death blow, with Ethereum ETFs inevitably following Bitcoin. With the top 20-40 cryptocurrencies completely dominating total market capitalization, most activity could shift to ETFs if they were approved.  Traders could simply buy and sell the ETFs instead of using exchanges. As Quartly-Janeiro asks, “why pay more” on exchanges when you can access the major cryptocurrencies more cheaply? At that point, exchanges must provide unique trading pairs and improve offerings to attract activity. But this is also a challenge for smaller cryptocurrency projects if the large caps consolidate power within ETFs. Quartly-Janeiro likens it to smaller equity markets in Europe, where liquidity and interest wane if you aren’t listed on the main exchange. ""Will the SEC approve a #Bitcoin  ETF?"" @andrewrsorkin  asks @SECGov  Commissioner @HesterPeirce : pic.twitter.com/ps11zgoeLk  — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) October 23, 2023   Of course, whether or not large capitalization crypto ETFs could drain liquidity and volume from exchanges depends on their approval. That, in turn, depends on who occupies the chairmanship of the SEC, an agency that has dragged its heels on spot Bitcoin ETFs for over a decade. After all, the first application for a spot Bitcoin ETF was filed all the way back in 2013  by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Both are now owners of the cryptocurrency exchange, Gemini. To compete with ETFs, crypto exchanges would also benefit from an improved user experience outside of their platforms, including more user-friendly wallets on and off their exchanges. That, by and large, is out of their control."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,How Does an ETF Come to Market? The Next Steps for Bitcoin Spot ETF,https://www.ccn.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-come-to-market/,"Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, have become incredibly popular investment vehicles in recent years. Especially in crypto world, as we gear up for the anticipated approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs.  But have you ever wondered exactly how an ETF is created in the United States? The process involves several careful steps, approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and thoughtful structuring to give investors the desired experience. First, let’s start with the basics: an ETF is an investment fund that trades on a stock exchange like a regular stock. ETFs offer investors an easy way to get exposure to a variety of market sectors, industries, commodities, styles, or regions without having to purchase each individual stock or asset.  For Bitcoin, and other crypto assets, which can be complicated to custody and trade, an ETF is a god-send. So why would someone want to go through the lengthy process of creating their own ETF? ETF sponsors may believe there is an unmet need in the marketplace for an ETF targeting a specific niche.  Or they may aim to provide an ETF that tracks a unique proprietary index designed by their firm. The choices are nearly endless. In the past, successful ETFs have been based on gold , property, or other financial assets.  The first step in creating an ETF is developing a concept and investment objective. Will the ETF track a basket of stocks, bonds, commodities, or other assets? The index or portfolio composition must be clearly defined upfront. Next, the ETF provider researches demand for their proposed fund and files a prospectus (BlackRock’s paperwork is here  as an example) with the SEC. This registration statement outlines details including investment strategy, risks, costs, trustees, and more. The SEC will review the statement to ensure regulatory standards are met. However, one of the sticking points in spot Bitcoin ETF applications has been surveillance-sharing agreements. These arrangements allow exchanges to share trading data to detect fraud or manipulation.  JUST IN: Cathie Wood’s ARK #Bitcoin  ETF now in pole position to be approved after application was amended to include surveillance sharing agreement just like BlackRock’s.  h/t: @EricBalchunas  pic.twitter.com/J9QfpHOugq  — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) June 28, 2023   The SEC recently denied Grayscale Investment’s application due to its apparent inadequate surveillance protocols.  However, a court overruled the decision, ruling that the SEC had not demanded similar standards for Bitcoin futures ETFs (namely the Teucrium Bitcoin Futures Fund  and the Valkyrie XBTO Bitcoin Futures Fund)  so why this product? Especially considering that both spot and futures funds are based on Bitcoin’s price. Though details are private, these surveillance agreements facilitate oversight across markets, and help assuage regulators that everything is above-board. Despite, the SEC’s court loss on the matter, expect robust surveillance-sharing agreements to still be included. While waiting for SEC approval, the ETF provider establishes the fund structure. Two common structures are a trust, which issues shares backed by underlying assets, or a corporation that issues shares and invests proceeds. Service providers are also selected like a custodian to hold assets and a trading agent to handle orders. In the case of BlackRock’s application , the ETF comes in the form of a trust, with BlackRock being the trustee, iShares the sponsor, and Coinbase as the Bitcoin custodian. The SEC may come back with questions or requests for revisions. Once all requirements are satisfied, the SEC declares the registration statement effective and the ETF can prepare to launch.  Leading up to the launch date, the fund manager creates new ETF shares, known as creation units . These units are acquired by approved organizations called authorized participants which provide the underlying assets to back the ETF shares. In BlackRock’s application, authorized participants are crucial in creating and redeeming Baskets of 40,000 Bitcoin ETF shares. They deposit Bitcoin with the custodian, pay a fee, and receive Baskets. The Basket size changes daily based on Bitcoin prices.  Only authorized participants can do this, helping keep share prices in line with Bitcoin’s value. They can also redeem Baskets to withdraw Bitcoin. Their role ensures the ETF’s performance mirrors Bitcoin’s price accurately. And—voilà! Finally, the authorized participants can list the new ETF shares on an exchange where they can be traded by individual investors and institutions. For most ETFs, this is an exciting, but relatively ordinary occurance. For crypto-world, the consequences could be game-changing.  "
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Why Bitcoin’s Prolonged +50% Dominance Matters,https://www.ccn.com/news/why-bitcoins-dominance-matters/,"Bitcoin dominance  – the percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization comprising Bitcoin – has been hovering around or above 50% since June 10. As of October 24, 2023, Bitcoin accounts for 53.94% of the overall crypto market cap, up significantly from 42.12% at the start of the year. But why does that matter? Well, the degree to which Bitcoin dominates the market can tell us a lot about investor sentiment and—taking into account current events—the narratives they’re (literally) buying into. Bitcoin dominance is calculated by taking Bitcoin’s market capitalization and dividing it by the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. This metric provides insight into how Bitcoin is performing relative to the broader crypto market.  Prolonged periods of 50%+ dominance signal that investor interest and capital flows are concentrated in Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies. This trend is important because it suggests Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a digital store of value and investment asset, rather than just a cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin was originally conceived as a peer-to-peer electronic payment system, its prolonged high dominance reflects a shift in how it is actually being used and valued. Several factors explain Bitcoin’s return to 50%+ dominance after several years below this threshold.  The prospect of the first physically-backed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) being approved by the SEC has driven significant investor interest. The ETF would make it easier for mainstream investment funds to gain Bitcoin exposure, releasing massive pent-up demand from institutional investors. As Paul Brody, Ernst & Young’s global blockchain leader, noted  on October 23: “If you look at the people who are buying Bitcoin, they are buying it as an asset. They are not buying it as a payment tool.” When it comes to cryptocurrency payments and transactions, stablecoins like Tether have instead taken center stage thanks to their price stability. Bitcoin’s volatility makes it work better as a store of value than a medium of exchange. Demand for Ethereum (ETH) also pales compared to Bitcoin if we judge by price action this year. ETH has underperformed Bitcoin in 2023 as the crypto industry languishes in a prolonged bear market. This suggests the much-hyped concept of “Web3” has failed to capture investor imagination to the same degree as Bitcoin’s digital gold narrative. That doesn’t mean Web3 is dead and buried, merely that it remains bubbling under the surface. Unique Ethereum addresses are continuing to increase  steadily, although Ethereum transactions have been on a long-term decline  since 2021. Bitcoin transactions, however, have taken a wildly different path . None of these figures should surprise close observers, but they do help illustrate why Bitcoin is looking so ascendant (and chipper) right now. Investors are buying Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, and geopolitical tensions, and in anticipation of big market movements. They’re not using it to pay for coffee. At least not yet, anyway. "
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Bad News for Bitcoin Bears: ETF News Caused $221 Million Loss in Liquidations,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-bears-etf-news-caused-221-million-liquidations/,"
Key Takeaways
 The cryptocurrency market has seen a flurry of liquidations due to a notable increase in Bitcoin’s value , emphasizing the significant volatility of the digital asset space. According to the statistics, Bitcoin crossed the $35,000 mark, sparking a chain reaction of liquidations worth almost $221 million. The $400 million in liquidations seen in the past 24 hours across the whole market for digital currencies can be attributed in large part to this incident. About $300 million of these liquidations were primarily attributed to the short side. This suggests that many bets on Bitcoin’s value declining rather than climbing have been closed. Bears are in charge of 99% of liquidations on BitMEX . On the previous day, dealers of Bitcoin (BTC) lost $224 million, while owners of Ethereum (ETH) suffered losses of $60 million. When a trader fails to meet margin requirements or does not have sufficient funds to keep their positions open, the exchange will liquidate their leveraged position for them. The analysts largely attribute these liquidations to the excitement surrounding the Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs that are awaiting approval from the U.S. SEC. The legal dispute was resolved last night when the court issued a directive for the Grayscale/SEC procedure. Grayscale can consider this outcome a victory, although its application for a spot ETF has not yet been approved. The founder of BitMEX, Arthur Hayes, emphasizes that this run may begin a bullish phase.

Key Takeaways
 After becoming accessible to the general public in 2009, Bitcoin started to gain popularity  around 2010, when the cost of one token increased from a few cents to $0.09. Since then, its cost has risen by tens of thousands of dollars, occasionally fluctuating by thousands of dollars in a single day – its price has sharply increased  recently as major institutional news is in the works. However, this rapid price rise is something to be wary of, according to famed Gold bug Peter Schiff — also a known Bitcoin detractor. Bitcoin’s jump  to over $35,000, on October 24, its highest level since May of last year, gave the movement of the coin’s price rising potential further momentum. From its lowest point this year, the price of BTC has overall increased by more than 125%. Its market valuation as a whole has increased to almost $672 billion as a result of this surge.   The increased anticipation that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a spot Bitcoin ETF later this year has driven up the price of Bitcoin. Analysts predict that the regulator will simultaneously approve ETFs from companies including BlackRock, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, and Ark Invest. According to the assumption, this clearance will increase institutional investors’ purchases of Bitcoin. Most importantly, Bitcoin will become more desirable due to its continued durability in a market with high-interest rates. In the last ten years, Bitcoin has shown that it can endure. Following the demise of Mt. Gox  in 2014, it flourished. It also managed to withstand the failures of Terra, FTX, Celsius, Voyager Digital, and Three Arrows Capital last year. The Covid-19 pandemic, one of the biggest black swan events of our generation, was maybe the biggest period of growth for Bitcoin. And most recently, when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to their highest level in more than two decades, it performed admirably. Notably, Bitcoin has also performed  better than gold, which is frequently regarded as a haven in difficult times. In comparison to gold, it has increased by more than 70% during the last 12 months. Therefore, it is possible that many institutional investors will decide to devote a small amount of their capital to Bitcoin. Long-term demand and big inflows will result from such a meagre sum. Peter Schiff, a well-known investor and supporter of gold, has cautioned  investors that Bitcoin’s peak is approaching. He stated in a Tweet that when the SEC authorizes the ETF, a Bitcoin peak will be confirmed. #Bitcoin  is now trading at $35K as speculators bet on SEC approval of $GBTC  converting into an ETF. Such a conversation will likely mark the top of the rally, if Bitcoin doesn't sell off prior to approval. The selloff will be less severe if the ETF conversion is rejected again. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) October 24, 2023   His claim has some validity. He said that the correlation between Bitcoin and other altcoins like Mina, Zilliqa, Stacks, Conflux, and Filecoin is what is driving their price growth. “When the SEC authorises a Bitcoin ETF, I also predict that these coins will decline. Buying the rumour is also known as selling the news. The most recent instance of this was with XRP, which increased following Ripple’s victory over the SEC. After then, it fell more than 50% from its peak.” My 11-minute summary of the essence of money, the problem of inflation, the paradox of investing, and the brilliance of #Bitcoin . pic.twitter.com/R6t15sAHFp  — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) October 23, 2023   However, Peter Schiff could be mistaken in the long run. Bitcoin has already undergone a significant stress test in the last ten years. Some of its more serious problems, such as the implosion of Terra Luna and the FTX collapse, have been overcome. It is therefore hard to rule out a scenario in which it moves and retests its record high as it gets more popular."
2024-04-15 13:21:00+00:00,Crypto Winter End in Sight for Institutions as ETFs and Halving Reinvigorate Interest,https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto-winter-end-for-institutions-etfs-halving-reinvigorate-interest/,"If Bitcoin’s November 2021 all-time high price marked crypto’s hottest day of the year, what followed was a 13-month cold spell that saw the world’s preeminent cryptocurrency lose around two-thirds of its value.  In 2023, the mild spring of January-March made up some of Bitcoin’s earlier losses but failed to transition into the strong recovery investors have been waiting for.  However, as the end of the year approaches, anticipation for next year’s halving event and potential Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approvals in the US are injecting the market with renewed optimism. Now, even traditionally conservative institutional investors are starting to talk about the next bull run. In a recent report , Will Crypto Spring Ever Come? Morgan Stanley analyst Denny Galindo discussed the historical patterns in crypto markets, which he points out have historically adhered to a four-season cycle. According to Galindo’s cyclical model, several factors mark the end of crypto winter.  For example, he observed that “a 50% increase in price from Bitcoin’s low is typically a good sign that the trough has been achieved.” In other words, since confidently surpassing the $23,000 mark in March, History suggests that Bitcoin is now safe from collapsing back to the lows of 2022. Looking ahead to sunnier days, Galindo notes that in the past, most of Bitcoin’s price gains occurred after the BTC halving event, a pre-programmed change to the network that reduces mining rewards by 50% roughly every 4 years. For example, following the 2012 halving, Bitcoin’s price soared from about $12 to over $200 in just one year. With the next Halving on track to take place in April 2024, Galindo argues that it could initiate the next crypto summer, implying that spring may already have started. Certainly, excitement surrounding the SEC’s anticipated approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF could well have helped to precipitate a recent BTC rally, pushing the token’s price above $30,000 for the first time in months. For institutional investors, a US-listed Bitcoin ETF would represent a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency’s path to widespread acceptance, potentially opening the door to investment vehicles such as pension funds that have strict criteria for what type of assets they can invest in. however, with investors around the world holding their breaths, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve a single spot Bitcoin ETF application. But that could change soon.  In fact, recent Bitcoin price movements suggest that months of uncertainty surrounding the fate of ETF applications appear to have suppressed the cryptocurrency’s price, which looks increasingly primed to explode if the SEC ends its long-standing resistance to ETFs directly holding BTC. Consider, for example, that it only took one false report that Blackrock’s ETF application had been approved to spike the price of Bitcoin by as much as 5%.  In that case, the fund manager soon cleared up the misunderstanding and BTC quickly returned to its previous level. But if even fake news can have such a profound effect on the cryptocurrency’s price, imagine how the market might respond to a confirmed ETF Approval. "
2024-04-11 14:24:00+00:00,Bitcoin Lightning Network Security Vulnerability Explained,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-lightning-network-security-vulnerability-explained/,"In the past week, the discovery of a major security vulnerability affecting the Bitcoin Lightning Network has contributed to a slew of negative publicity and threatened to upend users’ trust in the platform. Thankfully, Lightning Network stakeholders have moved quickly to minimize the risks of a so-called “cycling replacement attack.” But current mitigating measures only attend to basic versions of the attack. And now the cat’s out of the bag, a more long-term solution is needed. The term cycling replacement attack was coined by Lightning Developer Antoine Riard, who published a paper  on the vulnerability last Monday, October 16. Riard’s discovery relates to the Lightning Network’s Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs), a kind of security contract that is created by each Lightning transaction, protecting payment channels from being duped without having to verify each transaction on the Bitcoin mainnet.  For a receiving address to release a Lightning payment from the contract, they need to create a secret code known as a preimage. If they don’t do so within a given timeframe, the sender can reclaim the funds. When sending Bitcoin via the Lightning Network, however, payments don’t always move from A to B. Rather, funds can move through multiple nodes on their journey, hopping from A to B via C, for example. How Does a Lightning Replacement Cycling Attack Work – Illustrated Primerhttps://t.co/VMpazXrh9z  — Lightning Network+⚡️ (@BTC_LN) October 22, 2023   In essence, a cycling replacement attack would intentionally jam the network, taking advantage of HTLCs’ timeout function to steal funds from middle-hop nodes engaged in contracts with sending and receiving addresses. That is to say, the attack would allow A to redeem its funds after C has already created the redemption clause needed to fulfill its contract with B, which would then be able to steal the value of the transaction from C. After he initially publicized the existence of the Lightning Network’s HTLC vulnerability, on Friday, October 20, Riard said  it puts the technology in “a very perilous position.” Although he acknowledged mitigations employed after the discovery of the vulnerability “are worth something in [the] face of simple attacks,” he added that more advanced attacks could still pose a major threat.  Nevertheless, on Saturday, after media widely reported the vulnerability, Riard expanded on his position, arguing that very few actors would be able to pull off such an attack. A lot of BTC infrastructure and development isn't hardened because it isn't under a high level of attack. Operational security should still be prioritized even if nothing happens, even if it's a difficult decision to spend on costly defenses without the motivation of past failure — Alex Bosworth (@alexbosworth) October 20, 2023   “More advanced attacks can only be mounted if you have sufficient p2p and mempool knowledge,” he stated, adding that it could “years to acquire for average Bitcoin developers.” Looking ahead, Riard noted that changes to Bitcoin’s security architecture might be necessary to fully remove the risks posed to the Lightning Network. However, building the consensus necessary for such upgrades is notoriously difficult. As Riard acknowledged, “those types of changes are the ones necessitating the utmost transparency and buy-in of the community as a whole.”"
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Is the Bitcoin Lightning Network Safe After Security Issue Discovered?,https://www.ccn.com/news/is-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-safe-after-security-issue-discovered/,"
Key Takeaways
 Network vulnerabilities present a number of threats to your company since they are the point of entry that threat actors utilize to access your internal network. The Bitcoin Lightning Network, a second-layer solution designed to speed up transaction times on the Bitcoin blockchain, has discovered a significant vulnerability in its system. A developer found the issue and he has now taken a decision on his future in the company. Antoine Riard, a Bitcoin developer, disclosed the problem  and provided specifics in a study released last week. The “replacement cycling attacks” vulnerability has the potential to put the safety of money moving across the Lightning Network in danger. Q: Is Lightning Network fatally flawed and doomed to destruction? A: There's no need to debate technical nuances with fearmongers. If folks are so sure about the severity of a weakness, they're free to exploit it! Go on, enrich yourselves, my node is waiting! — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) October 22, 2023   Theoretically, it might enable knowledgeable attackers to launch a “transaction-relay jamming attack” and target a crucial Hash Time Locked Contracts  (HTLC) element of the Lightning Network. Such an attack’s goal would be to obstruct regular transaction flow, creating delays or blocking expected transaction processing. This could increase the risk of losing money in the network’s channels. While the issue is concerning, there haven’t been any real-world attacks resulting from it. Based on observational data, Riard claimed that there is no proof of such operations over the previous 10 months. The report  stated that neither replacement cycling attacks nor real-world experiments on the bitcoin mainnet have been seen or reported in the wild in the recent 10 months. Antoine Riard said the network is vulnerable to replacement cycling attacks, which could permit malicious actors to siphon funds from mempools. https://t.co/uWsK7kugNx  — Laura Shin (@laurashin) October 23, 2023   The developer discovered the vulnerability in the Lightning Network and have since taken action, including deploying updates across key implementations like Eclair, LND, and C-Lightning. He did have some concerns, though, regarding how well these mitigations might work against more sophisticated attacks. This vulnerability may have effects outside of the Lightning Network. According to Riard’s study, the weakness might also affect a number of other Bitcoin protocols and applications, including batch payouts, peerswap , and coinjoins. The developer who discovered the flaw, Riard, concurrently issued a note announcing his decision to stop working on Lightning. As of right away, Riard wrote: “I’m ceasing my engagement in the development of the lightning network and its implementations, including coordinating the resolution of security vulnerabilities at the protocol level. In the meantime, John Deaton, a well-known supporter of XRP, criticised  the Bitcoin Lightning Network while disparaging another protocol on the XRP Ledger. Let me be clear and transparent: I am now involved in @Spend_The_Bits  as an angel investor and serve as its Chief Legal Officer. Therefore, please accept my comments with that in mind. But a major reason I invested in @Spend_The_Bits , or stated more accurately, invested in… https://t.co/aheyTxjGxp  — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) October 21, 2023   According to Deaton, the SpendTheBits protocol for XRP is a better choice than the Lightning Network. His position as Chief Legal Officer and an angel investor for SpendTheBits, however, might have an impact on his viewpoint."
2024-04-19 13:24:00+00:00,Tesla BTC Holdings Not Going Anywhere As Musk Cools on Bitcoin,https://www.ccn.com/news/tesla-btc-holdings-stable-musk-cools-bitcoin/,"Bitcoin investors often look to companies with large crypto holdings like Tesla for clues on market sentiment. So Tesla’s latest earnings report will do nothing to excite holders of the world’s original cryptocurrency. Considering Elon Musk’s famed ability to move markets with a single tweet (or “post”), perhaps Tesla’s Q3 earnings report showing stable Bitcoin holdings could be a welcome note of calm, considering the alternatives. It turns out Tesla’s love affair with Bitcoin may have cooled off significantly. The electric vehicle maker’s latest Q3 earnings report  appears to show that its Bitcoin stash has remained unchanged for the fifth quarter in a row. The report did not explicitly mention Bitcoin, indicating that its holdings have remained the same. Tesla is still holding steady at around 9,720 Bitcoins, valued at approximately $279 million as of October 19, 2023. The car manufacturer made a big splash back in early 2021 by investing $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and saying it would accept the cryptocurrency for car payments. Those days are clearly over, however. After liquidating 75% of its crypto holdings last year at a hefty loss, and selling 4,320 Bitcoin in the first quarter of 2021, Tesla has pressed pause on any further Bitcoin buying or selling. Its current Bitcoin trove makes Tesla the third largest public company holder of crypto, trailing only MicroStrategy and Marathon Digital Holdings according to bitcointreasuries.net . But don’t expect that position to change anytime soon. While Tesla clocked lower earnings in Q3, down 44% year-over-year, crypto trading clearly isn’t the priority. CEO Elon Musk may have boosted Bitcoin prices back in the day by championing crypto. But Tesla’s breakup with Bitcoin seems pretty definitive now. The company dumped over 30,000 coins in mid-2022 and hasn’t touched its remaining crypto stash in months. Despite assumptions, the South-African born billionaire has never been a huge cheerleader of the world’s original cryptocurrency. Back in May 2021, Musk halted plans to accept Bitcoin for payments over rising concerns about its environmental impact.  In a tweet, the Tesla owner said the firm would be looking at other crypto alternatives, and that cryptocurrency itself was “a good idea on many levels.” Currently, the only cryptocurrency you can buy a Tesla with is DOGE, Musk’s personal favorite cryptocurrency. Not that you’d want to. According to Tesla’s official support page , orders placed with DOGE cannot be canceled, returned, or even refunded in the original form of payment if you accidentally overpay.  Tesla & Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/YSswJmVZhP  — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 12, 2021   Later that year in December, Musk explained his affinity for the memecoin, saying Bitcoin “just gives power to new rich people,” and “That’s why I’m pro doge.”  In July 2021, the billionaire explained he had no plans to sell any of his Bitcoin in the near future, and that he doesn’t believe in dumping when the price is high. “I would like to see Bitcoin succeed,” he said. As we know, Musk eventually changed his mind. SpaceX sold all of their Bitcoin holdings in August 2023, whilst Tesla sold Bitcoin in both 2021 and 2022."
2024-04-15 13:21:00+00:00,Why is ‘Bitcoin ETF’ Trending on Twitter Today?,https://www.ccn.com/news/why-bitcoin-trending-on-twitter/,"
Key Takeaways
 There may soon be more alternatives available to those who wish to wager on Bitcoin, and this has Twitter in a frenzy as ‘Bitcoin ETF’ is trending following a bout of confusion news. Major financial institutions, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco, have applied to sell US “spot” exchange-traded funds (ETFs) directly linked to holdings in Bitcoin, while Grayscale Investments LLC has been successful in its effort to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF, having won a court decision on August 29. These products have frequently been rejected by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the past due to concerns about volatility and possible manipulation. However, the Grayscale decision and the BlackRock filing, in particular, may indicate that the cryptocurrency industry is taking the lead. However, many jumped the gun when a bogus report emanated from Cointelegraph suggesting that the SEC had approved the first offering in the U.S. With all the bubbling news, it is unsurprising that Twitter is so active around this point. Some of the reasons why ‘Bitcoin ETF’ is trending on Twitter include progress being made by Fidelity, BlackRock’s continued push in this space, and a looming deadline on their decision, as well as positive news for Grayscale. Not to mention, socio-economic factors like global conflicts, also have people looking towards safe-haven assets. As industry analysts and influencers expect that BlackRock’s Bitcoin spot ETF will launch soon, anticipation is growing. The popular cryptocurrency YouTuber Crypto Rover, who boasts an incredible 100,000 subscribers, claims that the BlackRock Bitcoin spot ETF’s actual expiration date or target date is within the next 60 to 90 days. This forecast is based on BlackRock’s decision to forgo an appeal of Grayscale’s recent legal victory, which suggests that they lack any legal justification to deny any Bitcoin Spot ETF applications. The real deadline/ expectation date for the BlackRock #Bitcoin  spot ETF is in the coming 60-90 days.  Here is why:  They haven't appealed Grayscale's win, meaning they have no basis to reject ANY Bitcoin Spot ETF. The final deadline for the initial application from ARK is set… pic.twitter.com/FOdptgaOx3  — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) October 17, 2023   The final date for the initial application from ARK , another significant participant in the crypto investment space, is set for January 10, 2024, according to Crypto Rover. Crypto fans predict that, should the SEC decide to approve any ETF, it will likely do so simultaneously with all others rather than picking one and rejecting the others. Therefore, the consensus among industry insiders is that the launch of the first Bitcoin spot ETF is likely to occur well before January 10, 2024. “Gary Gensler is standing in the way of spot Bitcoin ETFs – Cathie Wood,” according to “The Wolf Of All Streets.” The CEO of a well-known asset management company, Cathie Wood, stated that she does not believe the SEC as a whole, but rather SEC Chair Gary Gensler, is the biggest barrier to the establishment of a Bitcoin ETF. GARY GENSLER IS ""STANDING IN THE WAY"" OF SPOT BITCOIN ETFS – CATHIE WOOD She said the out loud part… out louder.

She went on to question Gensler’s decision to support a Bitcoin futures ETF while opposing a spot Bitcoin ETF, despite the latter’s lower counterparty risk. Notably, the SEC has already denied Ark Invest’s requests to launch ETFs twice. Grayscale Investments’ recent legal victory has increased pressure on the SEC to reconsider its position on spot Bitcoin ETFs. In the last 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin fluctuated around $28,450, staying steadfastly above a range of around $26,000 that had remained for most of the previous two months due to sluggish mood and unusually low volatility and trading volumes. One of the reasons was the fact that the application  for its Bitcoin spot ETF “Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust” had been resubmitted to the SEC, a major ETF issuer with $37 billion in 58 ETFs. The regulator’s concerns that were earlier voiced when rejecting the Bitcoin ETF update are being addressed by the revised proposal.

Since last Friday, when it was revealed that the SEC had decided not to appeal a federal court decision that essentially allowed digital asset management Grayscale to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF, Bitcoin has been on the rise. ETF issuers are working together with the SEC regarding changes required for SEC approval. BULLISH FOR #BITCOIN  🚀 pic.twitter.com/42nrcvwOEK  — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) October 18, 2023   Since the summer, when BlackRock and other major mainstream financial institutions filed for SEC approval, the possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF—which would hold the token itself rather than funds holding futures—has been a looming driver for cryptocurrencies. Although there is still uncertainty and potential roadblocks before any spot Bitcoin ETF starts trading, it is widely predicted that regulatory approval of such funds will revive the cryptocurrency markets and usher in a new wave of investment in Bitcoin. Despite this, traders are becoming more optimistic that the SEC will approve the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Look no further than the Grayscale discount. The trust owned by the asset management trades similarly to a closed-end fund, with a price that varies from the net asset value of the Bitcoin it owns. For almost two years, that variance has been discounted, but it is getting smaller: The Grayscale discount was at its tightest since late 2021 on Tuesday, when it was around 15%, down from almost 19% at the beginning of the month. Due to the recent Israel-Palestine conflict, the world is now more aware of the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Despite the wide-ranging impacts of the upheaval, one feature that is sometimes regarded as a safe haven in times of unrest has remained unaffected: the stability of the price of Bitcoin (BTC). Amid the Israeli authorities’ crackdown on cryptocurrency accounts and efforts to sever connections with Hamas following an attack, many have been closed, with millions in crypto assets seized. People attribute this action to growing concerns about global conflicts and their potential impact on the monetary system, prompting some to invest in Bitcoin. ""There is a way to trace transactions from bad actors and that digital paper trail has led to disruptions and seizures. The numbers we've seen need some context."" @SignCurve  on @crypto  w/@kaileyleinz  @mattmiller1973  https://t.co/WQGyPZ4SKZ  pic.twitter.com/7mHmfUwTV8  — Crypto Council for Innovation (@crypto_council) October 18, 2023   Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine , cryptocurrencies have been frequently in the news, with demand for the always-volatile bitcoin in both Russia and other countries. During the greatest attack on a European nation since World War Two, cryptocurrencies have performed as shown in the following charts. Crypto enthusiasts view the Bitcoin as “digital gold,” a convenient place to deposit funds in times of conflict or calamity. According to the argument, Bitcoin is more secure than conventional currencies because it has a finite quantity and operates on a worldwide computer network outside the control of governments. Nothing is ever really that easy. Uncertainty surrounds Bitcoin’s potential as a safe-haven asset: It frequently exhibits more risk-on asset characteristics, like equities. Be it as it may, Bitcoin is not just a speculative asset, it is also a seizure-resistant, policy-independent, longer-term store of value, and the war has contributed to this perception. It is unclear which of the most recent wave of applications for a Bitcoin ETF the SEC will approve. However, the recent push for one from organisations like BlackRock may be an indicator of a more significant development for the token: the entry of institutional investors."
2024-04-15 13:21:00+00:00,"Bitcoin ETF Fake News: Proves SEC’s Manipulation Point, or Shows Market Exuberance",https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-etf-fake-news-manipulation-or-exuberance/,"Pity the fool that messes up on a slow news day, said someone, somewhere—probably. At least, that should be the epitaph for the October 16 debacle that had the crypto world transfixed for several hours.  It all began when Cointelegraph tweeted fake news about an SEC approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. An announcement that, if true, would make it the first of its kind in the U.S.  Over the course of about an hour, the news suddenly disintegrated as BlackRock confirmed its application was still pending approval. But not before Bitcoin had surged 5% in mere minutes. Pity the fool, indeed. In the flurry of excitement, and subsequent wave of disappointment, industry watchers were anxious to know how this might affect the pending applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs.  Famously, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman, Gary Gensler, takes a dim view of crypto. Well, at least now he does . The worry among many is that the recent episode will only confirm Gensler’s priors. Namely, that the cryptocurrency markets are “open to manipulation .” But is he wrong? In order to consider this question, it’s important to lay out why cryptocurrency markets are different from other financial markets and how this increases the chances of manipulation.  Firstly, crypto markets tend to be much less liquid than major markets like the stock or forex markets — because there is less overall trading volume, large trades, or coordinated efforts can have an outsized impact on prices.  Gensler about to nuke all the bitcoin etf applications because of market manipulation  Thank you for your service — Danny Nelson (@realDannyNelson) October 16, 2023   A whale making a large buy or sell order in the Bitcoin market is more likely to provoke a market movement. Something that is harder to achieve in highly liquid markets where large orders represent a smaller percentage of volume. Second, cryptocurrency markets are more decentralized, with trading spread across many exchanges and platforms. This fragmentation can make prices more volatile and make coordinated manipulation easier than on centralized exchanges like NYSE and NASDAQ. Theoretically, this means traders can take advantage of price differences across platforms. To compound things further, many market participants are small-time traders rather than institutional investors. These retail traders are usually much more susceptible to panic selling or reactive buying around price swings and rumors (see: October 16).  Now, whether or not the above points constitute the ingredients for a market open to manipulation is another question. However, it’s unlikely that Gensler and the SEC think the market is irredeemably crooked. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have approved a Bitcoin futures ETF —distinct from the spot Bitcoin ETFs still awaiting approval. It’s also unlikely that the SEC would about-turn on what looks like a promising pathway to approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs simply because of media misbehavior. After all, this isn’t the first time dodgy reporting has caused tremors in markets. One precedent pointed out  by Jeff Dorman, Chief Investment Officer at Arca, is illustrative. In April 2013, someone hacked  the Associated Press’s Twitter account and posted a headline with the news that the White House had been attacked and President Obama injured. The tweet caused markets to plunge, wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars in losses in equities and debt. The episode also took place the same month Bloomberg had added Twitter  to its trading terminals, a fact that probably escalated the crisis. Crucially, after the episode, there was no meaningful response from the SEC.  Will Cointelegraph get a slap on the wrist or a strongly-worded letter? Potentially. But, to imagine the SEC scrapping over 10 spot Bitcoin ETF applications because of a tweet appears far-fetched—at least for now. "

As Bitcoin surged and then landed back down to earth, nearly $100 million worth of positions were liquidated. The source of the news — a Cointelegraph post  on X — has since been confirmed as false. But whilst the market quickly corrected, the reputational and legal fallout may not be over. With crypto community members crying “foul play,” let’s review what happened and what the consequences could be. The crypto community had been waiting with bated breath for news of the first U.S spot Bitcoin ETF when yesterday afternoon (UTC), Cointelegraph posted on X that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved the BlackRock iShares ETF application.

Then, 11 minutes after Bitcoin spiked, Eleanor Terrett, a journalist at Fox Business, posted  that a source at BlackRock was confirming the story as false — their application was still under review. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas  and CoinDesk followed shortly after to pour water on the story. Twenty minutes after Bitcoin had breached $29,000, it came crashing down to $27,855—marginally lower than it had been previously. A stunning and lightning-fast correction, and then it was all over. A source from Cointelegraph confirmed to CCN that the incident was purely human error, miscommunication between the news and social media team, and failure to follow standard operating procedures. However, the cause of the mishap appears to have been sloppy reporting at first glance. Noted crypto sleuth ZachXBT discovered  a Telegram channel that had posted the exact same fake news reported by Cointelegraph 39 minutes before their initial X post. The publication later confirmed  that this was the source of their story. In an X post later in the day, Cointelegraph conducted a quick investigation. It found its process of verifying sources before posting breaking news on social channels was not followed. A user in this Telegram channel posted the exact same fake news reported by CoinTelegraph 39 minutes before their tweet. After they deleted their message and account. pic.twitter.com/CP98ex56ZU  — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) October 16, 2023   At an event in Dubai, Cointelegraph editor-in-chief was in damage control mode, stressing that the pressures of digital journalism had helped create the conditions for the slip-up. “This is what happens when we are having constant pressure to be the first with every news. It’s not a journalism problem, per se, it’s a problem of society and technology…If you’re not first, you’re last, and this is a big problem,” said Kristina Lucrezia. However, those in the comments seemed generally unsympathetic. David Z. Morris , until recently a CoinDesk columnist, appeared unsurprised by the market-shaking gaffe, posting: “Cointelegraph? Unreliable dogshit? By JOVE.” Wow , LIVE from Dubai ! so @Cointelegraph  Editor In chief on a panel just now in Dubai with @MarioNawfal . Sounds like she is totally deflecting responsibility of good journalism after they wiped out USD 100 million on BTC saying it’s basically the readers fault we didn’t check… pic.twitter.com/Epz33mJc3Q  — Tim WEB3 (@timweb3_) October 16, 2023   Tim Copeland, the editor-in-chief of The Block, shared a screenshot  on X of an individual claiming to be behind the episode, who claimed to have made no profit from the sharp spike in Bitcoin’s price. “I was literally… shaking for a couple of hours straight when I heard what had happened,” he said . Larry Elliot, the CEO of BlackRock, the original applicant behind the iShares spot Bitcoin ETF appeared a little more excited  by the news and called it an example of “the pent-up interest in crypto,” according to Eleanor Terrett. An understatement for the ages. However, not everyone was as chipper as the BlackRock CEO. Other spectators were loudly asking whether there had been any financial incentive for the misreporting.  Many questioned if this was a blatant case of market manipulation,  with some speculating about jail time . Others highlighted the irony  of the SEC’s reluctance to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF because of a risk of market manipulation when it appears an approval may not have been necessary at all. If that turns out to be fake, and Cointelegraph can't prove they were misled into false reporting, then they are going to get a nasty lesson in anti-manipulation laws… — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) October 16, 2023   The accusation is, either implicitly or explicitly, that a reporter, editor, or other staff member had taken out a short position in Bitcoin futures or options contracts. Therefore, leaving them primed for when the market suddenly changed.  As of yet, nobody directly affected by the market movement appears to have made those allegations explicitly to a regulatory body. If that were to happen, things could escalate quickly. After all, the SEC under Gary Gensler has a well-earned reputation as a crypto skeptic. In response to the episode, the regulator advised  readers to be “careful what you read on the internet. The best source of information about the SEC is the SEC.”"
2024-04-15 13:21:00+00:00,Bitcoin Price Manipulated by BTC ETF News Causes Huge Liquidations,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-price-manipulation-btc-etf-news-liquidations/,"
Key Takeaways
 The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a first for the US, might become an ETF as a result of the SEC’s decision to appeal. Traders have predicted that Bitcoin’s value will continue to grow as a result of this event. However, that time has not yet come — although it felt like it had — as the price of BTC nearly reached $30,000 following rumors that the US Securities and Exchange (SEC) had approved the spot Bitcoin ETF. After BlackRock refuted the rumors, the price began to decline back to the $28,000 mark. Due to the rumor-induced volatility, trades worth more than $105.28 million were settled in a single hour. Particularly, deals for $73.25 million in shorts and $32.03 million in longs were settled. THE GBTC DISCOUNT HAS NARROWED TO 16% AS THE MARKET BETS ON A BITCOIN SPOT ETF APPROVAL. Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust, commonly known as GBTC, has experienced notable changes in its market dynamics. At the start of this year, GBTC was trading at a significant discount of 48.31%… pic.twitter.com/2nWLmvnewb  — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) October 13, 2023   According to recent data from YCharts , as of October 13, GBTC’s discount to Bitcoin’s net asset value (NAV) was 15.87%. A key statistic that shows how much a mutual fund or ETF is trading below its net asset value is the discount to NAV. It acts as a gauge to determine the discrepancy between a security’s trading price and its true value. The submission of spot Bitcoin ETF applications by BlackRock and other financial institutions in mid-June appears to have impacted the lowering of GBTC’s discount. The discount shrank from 44% on June 15 to 26.7% by July 5 and has been shrinking ever since, according to data. Bitcoin’s price increased by more than 2.5% in the last day and by 4% overall during the weekend, placing it just below the significant $28,000 milestone. The increase in Bitcoin’s value  has caused a large reverberation throughout the whole cryptocurrency market, resulting in a total of $75 million in liquidations during the last 24 hours. Of this sum, $30 million in short liquidations were brought on by the rise in Bitcoin’s price alone. A study of the liquidations showed that short liquidations, which accounted for $62 million of the total, predominated over long liquidations, which accounted for the remaining $13 million. According to Watcher Guru, another $65 billion was liquidated right after fake news regarding SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETF. JUST IN: $65 million $BTC  liquidated within minutes following fake reports that BlackRock's Spot #Bitcoin  ETF was approved. pic.twitter.com/Uxb6pCfhdu  — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) October 16, 2023   The rest of the sector also followed  the original crypto in this rally (as is usually the case), which is why shorts around the sector have taken a beating today. The table below shows what the individual contribution towards this liquidation squeeze has looked like for the different symbols in the sector. In line with expectations, Bitcoin accounts for the greatest portion of liquidations ($31.5 million), followed by Ethereum ($13.06 million). Interestingly, Loom Network (LOOM), although being only the 71st largest asset in the industry by market valuation, is third on this list. Perhaps as a result of the altcoin’s recent dramatic surge of more than 113%, there has been so much interest in it on the futures market. The quantity of contracts connected with the asset that is open on the futures market, as measured by the Bitcoin open interest, has increased  since the liquidation flush, as noted by CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn. Once more: some traders are off to a challenging start this week with 🤕 https://t.co/eLZ7BFcAp9  pic.twitter.com/EgUXg67cHE  — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) October 16, 2023   Even though many traders were being liquidated, it appears that additional speculators have entered the market. Since high open interest typically indicates volatility, the indicator’s return to its pre-dive levels could indicate that BTC will experience more abrupt price movements in the near term."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Has the SEC Approved BlackRock iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF?,https://www.ccn.com/news/has-the-sec-approved-blackrock-ishares-spot-bitcoin-etf/,"Reports from Reuters via Benzinga,  and repeated by other media outlets, appear to confirm that the BlackRock/iShares Bitcoin ETF has been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. If true, this would be the first time a spot Bitcoin ETF has been approved in the U.S. There are reasons to doubt the story, however. For one, the SEC has yet to update its website. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett  also reached out to her sources at BlackRock, who denied the story. Their application is still under review, said a spokesperson. 🚨NEW: Official statement to @FoxBusiness  from @BlackRock :  “The iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF is still under review by the SEC.” — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) October 16, 2023   In response, several tweets around the news have since been deleted. Bitcoin’s price jumped significantly from $27,962 to 29,388 within minutes of the story breaking before dropping down to $27,855 within 20 minutes.  The immediate reaction following the slap down by Terrett were cries of manipulation. Many X (formerly Twitter) users are actively speculating about a false flag operation to bump Bitcoin’s price, which always responds positively to progress on the ETF front. We may have some time to wait for official news of an approval. The SEC is currently reviewing several spot Bitcoin ETF applications from the likes of ARK Invest, Fidelity, Invesco, and WisdomTree.  BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, first applied for its spot Bitcoin ETF back on June 15. It was the first of these latest tranche of applicants to do so. As recently as last week, Bloomberg analysts predicted there would be a 90% chance that a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved by January 1. "
2024-04-15 13:21:00+00:00,Bitcoin ETF Path Made Clear After SEC-Grayscale Decision: Here’s What’s Coming,https://www.ccn.com/news/grayscale-spot-bitcoin-etf-what-next/,"On June 15, when BlackRock applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF to make it easier for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, little did we know that it would be the first of a flurry of applications. At the time of writing, a long list of firms such as ARK Invest, Fidelity, Invesco, and WisdomTree have joined the queue. Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission confirmed it would not relitigate Grayscale Investments’ own spot Bitcoin ETF application. The DC Circuit Court of Appeals had overturned Grayscale’s rejection by the SEC in August, after the regulator swatted down its original attempt on June 28. Now the path is set for Grayscale and others to begin launching their exchange-traded funds, so what happens next? The SEC initially decided to reject Grayscale’s application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust  (GBTC) to a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded-fund on the basis that it could not prevent market manipulation. However, a court overturned the measure, arguing the SEC had previously approved a similar surveillance agreement for a Bitcoin futures-based ETF. The SEC’s decision not to appeal this decision likely paves the way for the agency to look again at Grayscale’s application. However, the SEC approval process for spot bitcoin ETFs is still ongoing. The regulator has a complex role in evaluating any proposed ETF to ensure it meets standards around pricing, liquidity, custody and potential for manipulation or fraud.  1. Done deal I guess if this is accurate. No en banc application 2. No. I do not think they will appeal to the Supreme Court either.  3. Dialogue between Grayscale and SEC should begin next week. Hoping for more info on next steps sometime next week or week after? https://t.co/2EayzqeKGq  — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) October 13, 2023   While the decision not to appeal the Grayscale decision is encouraging, each spot Bitcoin ETF proposal will still need to be thoroughly reviewed by the SEC. According to a Bloomberg report, the agency is not planning  to appeal any other cases, according to a person familiar with the matter. Setting the stage for what could be a relatively easy rollout of several ETFs. The mood music appears right, too. James Seyffart , a Bloomberg analyst, called Grayscale’s GBTC conversion a “done deal,” believing it was virtually certain it would now go ahead. On October 15, Grayscale told  Eleanor Terrett, a journalist from Fox Business, that they remained “operationally ready” to make the change. Other applications look to be making progress, too. ARK Invest and 21Shares recently amended their joint application. The amendment, filed  with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 11th, provides additional details on how the proposed ETF would operate. ARK has just filed an updated version of its spot bitcoin ETF prospectus. The SEC emailed issuers a few wks ago with comments/qs about their S-1 that they wanted addressed so is very poss ARK has answered all that in this filing. We looking thru it now.. pic.twitter.com/AlwTt82WU0  — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 11, 2023   Specifically, the amendment explains the ETF’s practices for custodying bitcoin assets and determining their values. It states the ETF’s Bitcoin will be held in segregated wallets and not commingled with other assets. The amendment also elaborates on other key areas like arbitrage mechanisms. While the changes are spread throughout the filing, industry experts see this as a positive sign. Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, believes the changes meant that ARC has received and dealt with SEC feedback. Generally, a dialogue like this between the regulator and an applicant only takes place when deliberations are in their later stages. After months of wrangling, some analysts are now predicting  a 90% chance of SEC approval by approximately January 1. Furthermore, GBTC’s discount to Bitcoin’s net asset value has narrowed  to 15.87% as of October 13th, as the market priced in an imminent approval.  The approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States would be a major milestone for Bitcoin as an investable asset class. Unlike existing products such as Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a spot Bitcoin ETF would trade on a major exchange and track the price of Bitcoin directly.  This would provide a regulated vehicle for retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to custody the assets themselves.  Additionally, a spot bitcoin ETF would add a layer of safety and security for “normie” and risk-averse investors who are interested in Bitcoin but have so far stayed away. This de-risking could, in turn, provide a much-desired boost to BTC’s price."
2024-04-15 13:21:00+00:00,R-star: Is Bitcoin Price Feeling Heat of a Rising Real Neutral Rate of Interest?,https://www.ccn.com/news/will-rising-r-star-neutral-interest-rate-bitcoin-price/,"U.S. Federal Reserve interest rates have been on a wild run since the financial crisis of 2008, with big implications for Bitcoin. The central bank had them near zero between 2008 and 2015, then gradually raised rates to around 2.5% by 2018 before cutting them back down to near zero again in 2020 due to the Covid-19 recession. Then from 2022, the Fed raised rates ten consecutive times, a pace not seen since the 1980s. But with economic headwinds buffeting the U.S. and global economy, experts are speculating whether the R-star, the “natural” interest rate, may remain elevated for some time. A picture that might not look great for bitcoin. The so-called R-star is used to determine the appropriate level of interest rates to achieve economic stability. Generally, higher interest rates tend to have a negative impact on Bitcoin prices.  Therefore a higher R-star—the theoretical benchmark that, when achieved, should result in full employment, stable prices, and sustainable growth—should be bad for Bitcoin. But how do we know where to look? Economists are forever trying to gauge this R-star figure—the “natural” interest rate that keeps inflation steady and the economy humming. Arguably, it’s more art than science, with some trial, and error, and educated guesses mixed in. R-star fluctuates based on economic conditions. When growth booms, R-star often rises since demand for loans and investments grows, pushing up equilibrium rates. If people expect high inflation, R-star may climb, too, as lenders want higher rates to offset eroding purchasing power. Productivity gains and potential growth can also boost the figure. Central banks try to match policy rates to R-star to balance stable prices and full employment. If inflation drops too low, they may cut rates below R-star to stimulate spending.  Conversely, high rates restrain the economy and can lower inflation. So policymakers aim to estimate and track R-star, adjusting rates when needed to meet their mandates. However, an analysis  out this month from RSM suggests this key economic indicator may be tilting upwards. According to their estimation, R-star has risen to between 1.75% and 2%. The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond puts the figure higher at 2.2%. A lot higher than the 0.5% it sat around for much of the past 15 years. But why does this matter? A rising “real neutral rate” or R-star means that risk-free interest rates are expected to stay significantly above the rate of inflation over time. This is problematic for Bitcoin for several reasons.  The circus that is the Fed:  The comments by Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly, made in Chicago, have raised fresh concerns about the neutral interest rate (R-star) and its potential increase, suggesting that the Fed may keep rates higher for a longer… — AEM (@AEM_Macro) October 11, 2023   First, it makes holding U.S. dollars in safe assets like Treasury bills more attractive, as they offer a real positive return. This provides unwanted competition with Bitcoin’s appeal as a store of value. Why rely on Bitcoin when low-risk, traditional investments can compete? Second, Bitcoin’s security over the long term likely depends on generating sizable transaction fees. But with high real interest rates, the incentive to hold dollars rather than transact in Bitcoin increases.  That could starve Bitcoin of the fee revenue needed to sustain its network security as block rewards decline with each halving. Dan Smith of Blockworks Research has estimated  that for fee generation to fully replace the current level of block rewards, Bitcoin would have to trade at $750,000. (It is currently trading at $21,800—so a little way to go yet.) In economics, there is generally an inverse relationship between interest rates and inflation. When interest rates are high, borrowing becomes more expensive, and people and businesses tend to spend less. So, positive real rates suggest that damaging hyperinflation is less imminent.  So while profligate U.S. spending may seem bullish for Bitcoin at first glance, the likely policy response of higher real interest rates curbs Bitcoin’s upside potential. At least for now, a rising R-star dims Bitcoin’s trajectory by making the competition – holding dollars – more compelling. At least, that’s the theory of Byron Gilliam  in Blockworks. With the Fed pumping $6 trillion into the economy for the pandemic, and the U.S government spending rising to 9.45 trillion  in Q2, the stars looked aligned for bitcoin’s price. But with another star—the natural interest rate—ticking upward, Bitcoin’s future potential may well be in question."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Massive $275 Billion Single-Day US Debt Spike to Boost Crypto Buying?,https://www.ccn.com/news/massive-275bn-us-debt-spike-boost-crypto-buying/,"
Key Takeaways
 The US Department of Treasury recently boosted  the Nation’s debt by an amount equal to more than half of the whole market capitalization of Bitcoin (BTC) in a single day, amid an impending global financial crisis and the rising national debt of the United States. The US national debt reached a record-high  of $33.442 trillion after growing by $275 billion in a single day. According to observations made by Samson Mow, CEO of Pixematic and JAN3, in an X post  on October 4. The overall market cap of Bitcoin at the time of publishing was $536.69 billion. In a single day, the US added more than half of #Bitcoin ’s entire market cap in debt. That’s something like 10 million @BTC . And yet there are still people that are unsure if $27k is a good price to buy. pic.twitter.com/RMxdzB01yL  — Samson Mow (@Excellion) October 4, 2023   Indeed, as Mow pointed out, the monumental US debt amount is equivalent to about 10 million BTC, “and yet there are still people that are unsure if $27k is a good price to buy,” referring to the value of the leading crypto asset at press time. Typically, in uncertain times, cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, play an increasingly important role. A fiat currency burdened by increased government debt is not the only option available to people. This was clear when the 2008 financial catastrophe brought on the banks fueled cryptocurrency buying activity. Gold fell from the $1,900-$2,072 range to $1,823 as BTC-USD increased. The economic system is offering more and more alternatives than traditional fiat and assets. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has embarked on a frantic series of interest rate hikes as it wrestles to get run-away inflation under control, hiking rates at levels not seen since before the 2008 global financial crisis. As a result, the federal government is paying more just for the interest on the national debt, with projections showing those interest costs tripling from just under $400 billion last year to almost $1.2 trillion in 2032, forcing borrowing higher again to cover the higher interest expenses. Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser recently stated  that “raising rates won’t stop inflation, it’ll stoke higher inflation.” “The vicious circle is unrelenting. We have entered a death debt spiral,” he said, adding he expects “everything to go to zero against Bitcoin.” He also added debt is “going parabolic.” Debt’s going parabolic. We’ve crossed the event horizon. Bank holiday coming, perhaps as early as next week. https://t.co/Zuvu6c9kQl  — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) October 3, 2023   Analysts at Goldman Sachs  predict that in 2025, the cost of financing the U.S.’s mountain of debt will set a new record. They claimed that the costs associated with the US’s enormous debt load had increased due to the Federal Reserve raising interest rates over the past year. “We estimate that debt as a share of GDP will rise from 96% to 123% over the next decade, driven primarily by a chronic deficit of around 3%,” the note said. According to other projections, the national debt-to-GDP ratio will rise even more quickly. The Congressional Budget Office  has predicted that by 2053, the federal debt may account for 181% of GDP. “Although nominal GDP growth is likely to mostly offset the effect of higher interest costs on the debt-to-GDP ratio, the structural deficit will continue to add to public debt for the foreseeable future,” Goldman analysts concluded. According to the most current data gathered on October 4, Bitcoin was trading at $27,557 at the time of writing, showing a drop of 0.17% on the day but still a 5% gain over the previous week and a 6.1% increase on its monthly trend.  Credit: FinboldRobert Kiyosaki, the best-selling author of the personal finance book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” is one of them. He recently expressed his opinion  that Bitcoin is still a relatively inexpensive investment for the time being but will not remain so as other people will realize its benefits and rush to acquire it, which will inevitably increase its price. Be it as it may, the government avoided yet another shutdown when the House of Representatives enacted a funding bill that the Senate later approved. The money will allow the government to continue running for a few more weeks. Additionally, it unintentionally had a bullish effect on Bitcoin. Before the shutdown scare, Bitcoin rose from $27,010 to over $28,390 on October 2. BTC-USD ended the day at a price of $27,515. More U.S. Treasury bonds will need to be sold in order to fund the government’s increasing spending. As a result, the yield on Treasury bonds rises under increased pressure. Bitcoin is stronger than the U.S. dollar (DXY, UUP), despite both being robust."
2024-04-19 13:24:00+00:00,Bitcoin Price Boost Brings Solana up 15% as Bears Lose $94 Million,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-price-boost-solana-bears-lose-out/,"
Key Takeaways
 On Monday, Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed the $28,000 barrier to reach its highest price in more than a month. Analysts cited seasonality and ETF optimism as a few factors contributing to the increases. Last week, traders at the Japanese exchange Bitbank  were already keeping an eye on the $28,000 mark for Bitcoin. In the previous bull market, the $28,500 served as a significant support level. In the next weeks, it may turn into a level of resistance, making it an important price level to watch for. The surge in Bitcoin and Ether prices could be attributed to short liquidations in cryptocurrency futures markets. Approximately $94 million worth of bets against price increases were impacted on Sunday, leading to a “short squeeze.” This occurs when short sellers are forced to buy shares to cover their positions, creating excess demand and a scarcity of available stock. The data reveals that almost 30,000 negative bets were settled, the majority of which happened on the cryptocurrency market OKX. Liquidation happens when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange due to a loss of their initial margin. It occurs when a trader cannot fund or meet the margin requirements for their leveraged trade. Some traders attributed Sunday’s advances elsewhere to past seasonality. In the last day, Ether (ETH) crossed the $1,700 mark, Bnb (BNB), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) all saw price increases. Solana’s SOL tokens  are the reason behind most of the gains, up almost 15%, mostly because of some traders’ newfound faith in the network. Solana (SOL) has had a strong week, gaining over 25%. Open interest  in Solana now stands at $321.13 million, up 2.37% from the previous session. In the last 24 hours, the long/short ratio is 0.965, with short holdings at $534.18K and long positions at $304.30K. The SOL price may encounter probable resistance at $25 and $27. If it breaks out above these levels, it might rise to $32 in the future. A downturn, however, can resume if it fails to hold its current position, leading to potential support levels at $18 and $16. Some significant events in the Solana ecosystem provide the background to the SOL price momentum. Solana announced their merger with leading global e-commerce platform Shopify back in August 2023. The partnership would let millions of businesses to take blockchain payments with ease by immediately integrating Solana Pay, a decentralised payment protocol, into Shopify’s platform. Several events have had a positive impact on Bitcoin’s price. Firstly, they discussed the looming threat of a US government shutdown . Although this risk has arisen in the past due to disagreements over government spending, it has been resolved. Just hours before a crucial midnight deadline when funding for federal agencies was due to run out, President Joe Biden signed the short-term spending package passed by Congress into law. On Saturday evening, the Senate approved the legislation, following an unexpected shift in the House earlier in the day, where lawmakers passed a bipartisan bill to prolong government funding. This came after several days of uncertainty regarding the possibility of avoiding a government shutdown. The second factor is the growing speculation that the Federal Reserve may have concluded its rate hikes. While this is still uncertain and has been a topic of discussion for some time, recent developments have eased some concerns. However, it’s important to note that this situation remains fluid, and market sentiment can shift unexpectedly. Third factor may be the optimistic retail sales and factory output data from China  last month which have rejuvenated risk sentiment in financial markets. This has paved the way for continued price increases in the leading cryptocurrencies. The recovery has the potential to expose altcoin bears who engaged in leveraged bearish positions last month due to concerns about potential FTX creditor selling. These traders face the risk of exchanges forcing them into liquidation if the market moves against their positions, potentially resulting in a margin shortfall. The possibility of forced short liquidation is adding upward pressure on SOL’s price, leading to a rally driven by a short squeeze. The most significant near-term risk is now a positive one: the covering of short positions in altcoins could lead to leveraged liquidations that boost the entire cryptocurrency market. SOL is a cryptocurrency to watch in this context. VanEck launched  an official Ether futures ETF, leading to expectations of increased demand in the cryptocurrency markets. Analysts predicted a 90% chance of the ETF approval in the first week of October. The SEC may no longer utilise justifications and continue to refuse to approve ETFs on spot Bitcoin, according to the US Court of Appeals’ decision, which found Grayscale to be in the right and the SEC to be in the wrong. Because of this, a lot of people now consider approval to be quite likely, and the market is responding accordingly. BlackRock has an ETF approval rate of more than 99%, so when news of its request in this respect broke, the price of BTC also increased past $31,500. The Federal Reserve employs interest rate increases to slow economic activity when consumer prices are high, but they can also lower the prices of investments like stocks and cryptocurrencies. As a result, financial assets as a whole have struggled. The stock market often had a terrible month in September. According to statistics , the S&P 500 has fallen a median of 0.42% in September since 1928 and has experienced gains just 44.7% of the time. Over the past five years, Bitcoin  has experienced an average monthly price decline of 8.5% in September, contrasting with increases of 7.9% in November and 11.1% in December, along with an average gain of 24.6% in October. Bitcoin’s price has increased from the start to the end of September only 28.6% of the time since October 2014, with an average decline of 4.82%. Similarly, Ether has seen an average 8.5% price decline in September over the past three years, followed by an average 17.5% increase in October. Since November 2017, Ether’s price has been higher from the start to the end of September only 25% of the time, with an average loss of 10.8%. Ether’s monthly performance, according to data , has been worse in June than in September, with the price falling an average of 15% in that month."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,BTC Surges as U.S. Government Averts Shutdown — Can it Sustain the Momentum?,https://www.ccn.com/news/btc-up-us-govt-avoids-shutdown/,"Over the weekend, the US government narrowly avoided grinding to a halt after House Speaker Kevin McCarthy brokered a last-minute deal with Democrats.  As news broke that the House of Representatives had voted to approve a temporary funding measure on Sunday, the price of Bitcoin jumped by a thousand dollars. But while it bought the government 45 days to come up with a new funding plan, the fragile peace leaves many uncertainties hanging over crypto markets Having traded flat at around $27,000 for most of Sunday, September 1, 2023, as news that the US government had averted a shutdown in the afternoon, the price of BTC surged to over $28,000. On Monday morning, the cryptocurrency is up 4.61% in 24 hours and showing bullish momentum as it approaches $28,500. Hot in pursuit, the price of ETH followed a similar pattern, jumping to over $1,700 for the first time since mid-August upon news of the House deal and remaining buoyant into Monday. However, despite the otherwise rosy outlook, uncertainty over the future of crypto Exchange-Treaded Funds (ETFs) casts a lingering shadow over the market. After the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) scrambled to approve the first Ether futures ETF before a potential government shutdown, over the weekend, three asset managers were granted permission to list funds holding Ether futures contracts. On Monday, VanEck launched its Ethereum Strategy ETF  with the expectation that it will begin trading in the coming days. Meanwhile, Valkyrie said  it expects its registration with the SEC to convert its existing Bitcoin futures ETF into a mixed BTC and ETH fund will become effective by Tuesday. Finally, according to Nasdaq , ProShares has also received the go-ahead from the SEC to start investing in ETH futures. With the latest ETF approvals, the SEC appears to be moving in the right direction and the availability of Ethereum futures funds will likely create an influx of institutional investment in crypto markets. But will US investors ever be able to purchase shares in regulated crypto spot funds? Although the threat of a government shutdown accelerated the SEC’s approval of Ether futures funds, it appears to have had the opposite effect on applications to list Bitcoin spot ETFs. Having previously said it would deliver verdicts on spot Bitcoin ETF applications from BlackRock, Valkyrie and Bitwise by mid-October, on Friday, September 29, the SEC postponed its decision until January. With the US government still on course to shut down on Saturday, the SEC announced similar delays for applications from Fidelity, VanEck, and WidsomTree. The regulator said it was instituting additional proceedings to determine whether to approve or not the ETFs.  “Institution of proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved,” the SEC said  in a recent filing. With the SEC now embarking on another round of consultancy, none of the applications to list spot Bitcoin funds in the US will be approved until mid-January at the earliest. Moreover, if US lawmakers fail to negotiate a more long-term solution to the government funding impasse, another round of political crises could further stall their progress."
2024-04-15 13:21:00+00:00,Four U.S. Congressmen Urge SEC Chair Gensler to Approve Spot Bitcoin ETFs “Immediately”,https://www.ccn.com/news/us-congressmen-urge-sec-to-approve-btc-etf/,"
Key Takeaways
 A group of prominent U.S. Congressmen has written  to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, requesting the immediate approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). 🚨 BIG NEWS 🚨 US CONGRESS IS ASKING SEC CHAIRMAN GARY GENSLER TO APPROVE #BITCOIN  SPOT ETF  THIS IS MASSIVE 🔥 pic.twitter.com/FlkhVHnSef  — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) September 26, 2023   Representatives Tom Emmer, Mike Flood, Ritchie Torres, and Wiley Nickel signed the bipartisan letter , which emphasises the importance of expanding access to Bitcoin investment alternatives and the potential benefits for American investors. “We write to ensure the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) does not continue to discriminate against spot Bitcoin exchange traded products (ETPs),” the letter states . “The SEC is responsible for making certain that products that comply with investor protections are made available to investors.” According to lawmakers, spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a regulated and secure way for investors to access the world’s largest cryptocurrency, making it easier to buy and sell Bitcoin on traditional stock markets and potentially attracting a broader audience. The letter highlights the need for regulatory clarity, citing that the absence of spot Bitcoin ETFs has pushed investors toward unregulated and riskier options. Approving spot Bitcoin ETFs would establish a clear regulatory framework, enhancing investor protection and transparency. The letter asserts Congress’s responsibility in ensuring SEC approval of investment products meeting Congress’s established requirements. The SEC appears to have responded to Congress’s call by delaying Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest application until November 11, despite the fact that a decision was not required until November 11. Before a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said that most cryptocurrencies and crypto companies are subject to federal securities laws. According to prepared testimony , Gensler, who is scheduled to speak before the House Financial Services Committee, said that securities regulations have “been on the books for decades.” Gensler offered  a comprehensive summary of his views on cryptocurrency regulation in his prepared testimony: Gensler firmly asserted that cryptocurrencies should adhere to US securities regulations. He pointed out that when Congress enacted these rules in the 1930s, they could have been limited to traditional assets like stocks and bonds. However, Congress adopted a broader perspective, including various financial products under the term ‘investment contract.’ Gensler believes that most crypto tokens fall into this category, subjecting them to US securities regulations. According to Gensler, if most crypto tokens are subject to securities laws, then crypto intermediates must likewise follow similar rules. He referenced Sections 5 and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require securities exchanges, brokers, and dealers to register or meet exemption conditions. Gensler expressed concern about widespread noncompliance in the crypto industry, comparing it to the financial scene prior to the enactment of federal securities regulations in the 1930s. He highlighted that the SEC has launched a number of enforcement proceedings in order to hold violators accountable and safeguard investors. Gensler also stressed the SEC’s active role in making rules for the cryptocurrency industry. He mentioned a recent statement that clarified how current rules apply to cryptocurrency trading platforms, including DeFi systems. Additionally, this statement gave more information about systems included in a new proposed exchange definition. Furthermore, Gensler added that the SEC’s plan to revise investment adviser custody standards would apply to all crypto assets and strengthen the safeguards given by certified custodians. Gensler’s approach to regulating cryptocurrency is sure to draw criticism from House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry. In April, McHenry charged Gensler of failing to provide clarification on how firms can comply with federal securities rules. “You’re punishing digital asset firms for allegedly not adhering to the law when they don’t know it will apply to them. That’s nonsensical,” McHenry remarked  in April. On the other hand, other Democrats, including Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., have backed with Gensler  and stated that securities laws can work for crypto companies. In July, the House Financial Services Committee moved forward with two bills, as per Gensler’s testimony. One proposal aims to update cryptocurrency market rules, including a process for a digital asset to change from a security to a commodity. The other focuses on overseeing stablecoins. Coinbase will host ‘Stand with Crypto Day’ in Washington, DC, while Gensler testifies nearby. According to a blog post , they aim to meet with lawmakers and government officials to discuss how cryptocurrency is producing jobs in their areas."

Key Takeaways
 MicroStrategy has increased  its corporate treasury by 5,445 Bitcoin, demonstrating its consistent commitment to the cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 5,445 BTC for ~$147.3 million at an average price of $27,053 per #bitcoin . As of 9/24/23 @MicroStrategy  hodls 158,245 $BTC  acquired for ~$4.68 billion at an average price of $29,582 per bitcoin. $MSTR  https://t.co/GbJtUoQfXv  — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) September 25, 2023   158,245 Bitcoins (BTC) total, obtained at an average price of nearly $29,582 per Bitcoin, or roughly $4.68 billion, are now in the possession of MicroStrategy. Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, has been a vocal supporter of Bitcoin, referring to it as “digital gold” and highlighting its function as a strategic treasury reserve asset. With this most recent acquisition, MicroStrategy has solidified its place as one of the leading institutional investors in Bitcoin. Those who have been monitoring MicroStrategy’s progress in the cryptocurrency space are not surprised by the decision. When it made its maiden acquisition in August 2020, the corporation launched its first foray into Bitcoin investments. Since then, it has kept acquiring Bitcoin, even financing some of its purchases with loans. As this video  from Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo demonstrates, Saylor has maintained that Bitcoin is “underestimated” in comparison to other crypto industry potential. Saylor has frequently said that altcoins should be sold because they are overpriced. ✨ Saylor on #Bitcoin  not crypto, exactly 2 years ago. ""Everyone is underestimating $BTC ."" 👏 pic.twitter.com/7W6SoT6WpB  — RIZZO (@pete_rizzo_) September 24, 2023   It’s uncertain if more institutions will emulate MicroStrategy as Bitcoin gains recognition as a store of value and a potential hedge against economic volatility. The allure of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had Bitcoin enthusiasts riding high on a wave of excitement this past summer, but it appears the tide has abruptly flipped. Despite earlier indications to the contrary, achieving approval for a US Bitcoin ETF still appears to be a distant goal. As the drama plays out, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to put off the approval of large asset management companies like Fidelity and Invesco’s applications for Bitcoin ETFs. When BlackRock Inc., a major fund company, got on the Bitcoin ETF bandwagon in June, many people thought they might be holding the magic wand. Bitcoin’s price increased due to the speculative nature of the cryptosphere, under the assumption that BlackRock had an advantage over its rivals. But as it is, BlackRock’s participation has merely increased tension and brought about eventual disappointment. After BlackRock’s announcement, Bitcoin prices did indicate a hopeful 20% increase, but by August, the steady rise abruptly came to an end. The reason? Due to rising interest rates, there has been a long waiting period and a decline in the general enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency community is well aware of the unpredictable relationship between Bitcoin and ETFs. By the conclusion of the week, Bitcoin had entered its third straight dip after a roller-coaster of price changes, hovering around the $25,700 level. Even worse, the SEC’s postponements of the ETF ruling served as further proof of the market’s inherent fragility. It’s possible that October will serve as the final month. The SEC is now on a 45-day countdown to provide their next answer because of the recent deferments that are still in effect. This implies that the cryptosphere will undoubtedly awaken by mid-October. In addition, the SEC will need to decide how to respond to the Grayscale ruling. The introduction of ether-futures ETFs, which, rumors have it, the SEC might just approve, is a third change to look forward to in the upcoming month.  "

Key Takeaways
 According to blockchain intelligence company Arkham Intelligence , Coinbase is the top Bitcoin holder, meaning the largest organization in the world to possess Bitcoin (BTC), with a market cap of roughly $25 billion. On Friday, Arkham  that it had detected approximately 1 million BTC for Coinbase reserves on-chain, making the US-based cryptocurrency giant “the largest Bitcoin entity in the world”.  The exchange’s BTC holdings are almost equal to the amount credited to Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious person who created Bitcoin, as they represent around 5% of all Bitcoins now in circulation. Arkham has now identified $25B of Coinbase Bitcoin reserves (~1M BTC) on chain. This makes Coinbase the largest Bitcoin entity in the world on Arkham, with almost 5% of all BTC in existence – about as much as Satoshi Nakamoto. pic.twitter.com/7sDOczS7WT  — Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) September 22, 2023   A cold wallet with 10,000 BTC is among the 36 million deposit and holding addresses for BTC that Coinbase apparently hosts. The intelligence platform indicated that there might be millions of additional untagged assets. The Coinbase portfolio also has 1.68 million Ethereum (ETH), 68.6 million Chainlink (LINK), roughly 223 million USD Coin (USDC), and 921,000 BNB (BNB) in addition to Bitcoin. According to information on Arkham as of September 22, these assets help to make up Coinbase’s approximately $29 billion cryptocurrency portfolio. According to Arkham, Coinbase has a total holding of 947,755 BTC in its Bitcoin portfolio. To put things in perspective, the cryptocurrency price tracking website CoinGecko  estimates that there are currently 19,493,875 Bitcoins in circulation. However, it’s essential to emphasize that cryptocurrency exchange users primarily own the majority of these coins. Arkham revealed that Coinbase alone actively monitors and identifies nearly 36 million Bitcoin deposit and holding addresses using their on-chain analysis platform. The release of Arkham’s research coincides with Coinbase’s additional service expansion following regulatory permission  in Spain. As announced earlier, on September 22, Coinbase declared that it had secured Anti-Money Laundering (AML) registration with the Bank of Spain, marking a critical milestone in its global expansion strategy. With the help of this registration, Coinbase is now able to provide the entire spectrum of its cryptocurrency services to institutional and retail customers in Spain while also adhering to the legal requirements of that nation. Coinbase now has official regulatory milestones in Spain in addition to those in Italy, Singapore, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Canada. The exchange is likewise struggling with US regulatory ambiguity. According to Arkham Intelligence , the greatest Bitcoin holder is still Satoshi Nakamoto, who is said to own 1.1 million coins, valued at $30 billion at the time of writing. After Coinbase, two of the biggest exchange Bitcoin custodians are Binance and Bitfinex, with approximately 600,000 and 200,000 BTC, respectively. The US government is allegedly the owner of 205,515 Bitcoin, said James Zhong , the owner of the Silk Road marketplace, and as a result of the Bitfinex hack. Many Bitcoin billionaire wallets remain unidentified, with most of them staying idle after receiving their initial Bitcoin input An integral part of the project’s design is the fixed supply of 21 million Bitcoins, preventing artificial value inflation. Notably, the actual available Bitcoin supply is even smaller due to an estimated 3.7 million BTC permanently lost in inaccessible wallets."
2024-04-15 13:21:00+00:00,2021 Bitcoin Price Collapse: Was Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda the Cause of 87% Fall?,https://www.ccn.com/news/sbf-alameda-accused-of-btc-crash/,"
Key Takeaways
 An ex-employee who has begun to disclose the inner workings of Sam Bankman-Fried’s companies claims  that disgraced trading firm Alameda Research was responsible for the blip that caused Bitcoin (BTC) 87% collapse in 2021. As an engineer at Alameda Research, I had my entire life savings stolen from me by my former boss: Sam Bankman-Fried. Now, after months of recuperation from the craziness of the FTX collapse, I’m ready to tell my story. Let’s start at the beginning: (1/25) 🧵#SBF  #FTX  pic.twitter.com/x5wKvT0Dy2  — Adi (e/acc) (@aditya_baradwaj) August 23, 2023   Baradway and Binance.US did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bitcoin traders on Binance.US panicked on October 21, 2021, when the cryptocurrency’s price suddenly plummeted from around $65,760 to as low as $8,200 at 11:34 UTC (7:34 a.m. ET), before quickly rebounding. This abrupt drop had no apparent cause, while other bitcoin exchanges continued to operate as usual. Recent tweets from a former Alameda Research employee suggest that the trading company may be responsible for the turmoil, though the investor’s true identity remains a mystery. “I had my entire life savings stolen from me by my former boss: Sam Bankman-Fried,” said  the ex-employee, Aditya Baradway. Although algorithms conducted the majority of trades at Alameda, Baradwaj noted that traders could occasionally manually place orders during volatile market conditions or to capitalize on opportunities. This manual intervention led to the incident in question. The main one was our semi-systematic strategies, where traders set model parameters that control a complex automated trading system. This way, traders aren't placing actual trades, but rather fine-tuning an algorithm that decides how to execute the trades at high frequency. 3/n — Adi (e/acc) (@aditya_baradwaj) September 20, 2023   According to Baradwaj’s tweet, the trader tried to sell a block of BTC in response to the news and sent out the order via our manual trading system. They failed to notice that the decimal point was wrong  by a couple of spaces. They sold BTC for pennies as opposed to the going rate on the market. Arbitrage traders promptly noted the mispricing, then returning Bitcoin to its previous values. But Alameda suffered a significant financial loss. The result was immediate. The price of BTC shot from a high of $65k to as low as $8k on some venues, only to be quickly restored by arbitrageurs. The sudden price movement lit crypto Twitter on fire as traders scrambled to figure out what was going on: 8/n pic.twitter.com/50YP6PO84J  — Adi (e/acc) (@aditya_baradwaj) September 20, 2023   Alameda incurred massive losses, in the tens of millions, due to the sincere fat-finger error. Baradwaj explained that, given its genuine nature, there were limited options other than implementing additional sanity checks for manual transactions. “Binance US – which was the epicenter of the flash crash – released a statement claiming that it had been caused by one of their “institutional traders” who had a “bug in their trading algorithm” I guess Caroline had made some phone calls,” admitted Baradway mentioning Bakman-Fried’s girlfriend at the time. A prospective liquidation of FTX’s crypto holdings, according to  digital asset exchange Coinbase, won’t have a detrimental impact on the market. This analysis  was conducted in response to widespread concerns that the sale of FTX digital assets to investors for more than $3.4 billion will result in a significant price decline based on the asset’s weekly transaction volumes. Because of volume restrictions imposed at each stage of the liquidation, the company asserts that the sale won’t cause a significant market impact. Contrary to the initial rumors of a $1.3 billion overnight sale, the liquidations will start with a weekly cap of $50 million and gradually increase to $100 million in the coming weeks. Still, FTX debtors and their committees will need to approve a permanent $200 million per week. “Strict controls in place for selling certain ‘insider-affiliated’ tokens that require 10 days advance notice to these same committees,” said  David Duong, the head of institutional research. However, the business can sign contracts for hedging digital assets with a certified advisor under the provisions. This hedging agreement exclusively applies to Bitcoin and Ethereum, with the possibility of adding other coins subject to creditor approval. The company is also required to provide periodic updates (weekly and monthly) on balances, transactions, sales, yields, market insights, and other revenue-generating sources. According to a recent court judgement, the defunct exchange can now sell its cryptocurrency holdings to reimburse investors either directly or through investments. The collapse of FTX in November 2022 hit the market in a number of ways, from the immediate market decline that destroyed billions of dollars to the more current worries over the sale of its crypto holdings. The exchange reportedly has $7 billion in assets, including Bahamian real estate, stocks, and cryptocurrency, according to a recent court filing. The firm holds $560 million in BTC and $1.16 billion in Solana (SOL). The exchanges also own real estate valued at over $200 million and venture capital assets totaling over $4.5 billion in many businesses. Experts’ predictions that the sale would have a large effect on the market last week prompted Tron’s Justin Sun to call for greater community support and to suggest that he would make a bid for some of the assets in order to lessen the effects on the market."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Anti-Bitcoin Gold Backer Schiff: Dollar Heading for a Collapse,https://www.ccn.com/news/anti-bitcoin-gold-backer-schiff-dollar-heading-for-a-collapse/,"
Key Takeaways
 According to economist Peter Schiff, the American economy is doomed to failure . The Federal Reserve will “print money until the dollar collapses,” he warned, adding that “we’re going to have a dollar crisis and a sovereign debt crisis.” He said: “I think that day of reckoning is at hand.” Speaking on First TV, Schiff argued  that the 2008 financial crisis was the root cause of the inflation we are currently witnessing. “The cause of all this inflation is what the government did in response to that crisis: QE1, QE2, QE3, all of that, plus what we did during Covid. And as long as we keep running these enormous deficits, it will only grow worse, the economist explained. He issued a warning after noting that the United States has an annual fiscal deficit of almost $2 trillion and a rising national debt. According to Schiff, future inflation will be significantly higher than what we’ve seen in the past as a result of this. Inflation will likely be a much bigger issue in 2024 than it was in 2023. “Interest rates are a price. And it’s an important price for a lot of companies, just like labor, and rent, and raw materials, companies borrow money to conduct their business, to make capital investments, to expand. A lot of these companies have taken up debt over the years and now the cost of servicing that debt has risen sharply,” said  Schiff. Schiff also warned of USD devaluation, pointing out the global shift away from the dollar in favor of alternatives. He predicts a rapid decline in the dollar’s value as trading partners seek alternatives, leading to faster price increases and eventual loss of control. He concluded that, unfortunately, the story will have a horrible conclusion. According to him, there will be a crisis with the dollar and a crisis with sovereign debt. The Fed will continue to print money until the value of the currency drops. “I believe the day of judgement is near. I’m not sure if it will be tomorrow, but it will be arriving shortly, he clarified . Last week, Schiff also warned of a potential catastrophe and mass abandonment of the US dollar, reiterating his belief that the dollar will eventually collapse. He has consistently disagreed with the Federal Reserve’s recession predictions and advised selling dollars in July. Last month, he predicted a full-blown financial crisis in the US economy before the Fed reaches its inflation target. Schiff believes that Bitcoin has inherent flaws, despite its groundbreaking role in showcasing the potential of blockchain technology. He claimed  that the cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value and functions much like a Ponzi scheme, with demand for Bitcoin predicated on the idea of selling it to someone else for more money. “The demand for Bitcoin is based on the belief that you can sell it to somebody else at a higher price, and the only reason that the other person is willing to pay a higher price is because he believes that he can sell it to someone for an even higher price,” he stated, speaking on Yahoo Finance’s The Crypto Mile . However, in a recent interview with Fox Business, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the biggest asset manager in the world, compared Bitcoin to gold and asserted that it is “digitizing” gold. At first, Fink was skeptical of cryptocurrencies due to their early association with illegal activities. However, he later recognized Bitcoin’s value as a global asset independent of any specific currency and as a hedge against inflation. Fink believes  that the underlying blockchain technology has the potential to improve transaction speed and traceability, effectively eliminating some conventional financial intermediaries, notwithstanding the skepticism surrounding its usefulness.  "
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Fed Rate Decision Today Impact on Bitcoin Explained as BTC Options Expire Friday,https://www.ccn.com/news/fed-rate-decision-today-impact-bitcoin-options-expire/,"
Key Takeaways
 The level of price volatility in Bitcoin (BTC) continues to be muted, which is consistent with the Fed rate expectations and the lack of turmoil in the American stock and bond markets. Some cryptocurrency traders predict that the low volatility regime will continue following the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) rate decision  on Wednesday. The Fed will release a statement, the Summary of Economic Projections, and a fresh “dot plot” of interest-rate forecasts along with the rate decision on Wednesday at 14:00 ET. 30 minutes later, Fed’s chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference. The price of Bitcoin  decreased by less than 1% to around $26,998, still trading close to its highest level so far in September. With volumes and volatility at historically low levels, the largest digital asset has, for now, moved outside of the $26,000 range that has dominated trade for the previous month. Since March 2022, the central bank has increased interest rates by 525 basis points in an effort to control inflation. The early stages of the so-called tightening cycle have caused volatility in the traditional and crypto markets, which are dependent on liquidity. According to Greg Magadini , director of derivatives at Amberdata, the central bank is expected to keep the benchmark borrowing cost steady between 5.25% and 5.5% on Wednesday, sticking to its well-known data-dependent approach. Rates traders also anticipate that the Fed will likely maintain rates unchanged on Wednesday, with a high probability. “The Fed has been certain that it would continue to be ‘data reliant’ and that it will be able to ‘keep rates higher for longer. Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, wrote  to customers on Monday, “To me, this indicates the Fed can manage this week’s FOMC meeting by keeping rates constant, but signaling rates will remain elevated as they monitor economic reports. According to Magadini, “This would turn the FOMC [Fed] meeting into a low volatility event.” The Federal Reserve has consistently refused to declare an end to the cycle of rate hikes that started in March of last year, insisting that the future course of action with regard to interest rates depends on how inflation and employment develop. On Wednesday, September 20, 2023, with inflation projected to pick up, analysts expect the Fed to reiterate its position. Additionally, if the Fed indicates an end to the tightening cycle, markets, which have grown accustomed to swift rate drops over the previous four decades, may swiftly price in renewed liquidity easing, complicating matters for the central bank.
In other words, the likelihood of a surprise from the central bank favouring the current low volatility regime in traditional markets and bitcoin is low. We don’t think it [volatility] will come from this Fed directly, according  to Singapore-based cryptocurrency trading company QCP Capital. “We anticipate the FOMC’s desire to raise again being extremely low heading into the remaining three meetings of the year. At the same time, given the rising pump prices and rising inflation, we do not see how Powell can confidently declare an end to this hiking cycle,” the company stated . “With [Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell likely to attempt his best volatility-killing fuzzy guidance yet again, it is unlikely that the current market pricing of a half-hike this year followed by three cuts next year will shift much,” QCP continued . These rate decisions may not occur, according to expiring Bitcoin options that cover the Fed and Bank of Japan (BOJ) meetings on Friday. Options are a type of derivative contract that grant the buyer the option, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a fixed price at a later time. Currency traders frequently use options to estimate possible post-event volatility in the underlying asset. Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at cryptocurrency services provider Matrixport, stated: “Based on Bitcoin options market pricing, traders expect that BTC will only move by 2.8% this Friday, a sign that nobody expects any market-moving comments from Chairman Powell.” Regardless, analysts anticipate the central bank will keep interest rates stable in the near term, although uncertainty remains about its stance in November concerning potential rate hikes and their potential impact on inflation. Bitcoin, which has been influenced by the tightening monetary policy of the Fed, may be affected as higher returns on low-risk assets often reduce demand for riskier investments like cryptocurrencies. The upcoming Fed decision has the potential to trigger increased market volatility. Many traders have taken substantial bullish positions in Bitcoin within the highly leveraged perpetual futures market, a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem. The total open interest in Bitcoin futures on Binance , the world’s largest crypto futures market, has steadily risen to $3.3 billion in only three days, indicating a strong bias toward bullish bets. Considering the substantial leverage inherent in these positions, a hawkish Fed stance could make traders apprehensive, possibly triggering a rapid sell-off and causing Bitcoin prices to plummet as leveraged positions face liquidation."
2024-04-19 13:24:00+00:00,"Bitcoin Outflows Contrast with Solana, Cardano, and XRP Inflows: Altcoin Season Loading?",https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-outflows-contrast-with-solana-cardano-and-xrp-inflows-altcoin-season-loading/,"Throughout 2023, Bitcoin has outperformed most major altcoins, having increased in value by 63.23% since the beginning of the year. In contrast, the likes of BNB, DOGE, DOT and MATIC have declined in value during the same period. However, in the week to September 17, Bitcoin comprised 85% of all outflows from digital asset investment products. Meanwhile, Solana, Cardano and XRP saw positive inflows. Could the trend signal the start of a new altcoin season? After Trading Flat in July, the price of Bitcoin crashed in mid-August. And despite a mild rally in September, BTC is still trading well below its July high of over $31,000. Weak market performance has translated into reduced demand for Bitcoin-tracking Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs). To take just one example, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO ) has seen outflows of $74.36M since the beginning of August, clocking net negative flows in 7 out of the last 9 weeks.  Coinshares data  shows that the trend is reflected across all the Bitcoin ETPs it tracks, with net outflows totaling $455M. Last week alone, $45.2M of investment flowed out of Bitcoin ETPs, which have registered $117.8M in outflows so far this month, the data shows. At the same time as investors have been reducing their exposure to bitcoin, investment in several altcoins has spiked, reflecting their strong price performance compared to BTC. According to Coinshares , last week, Solana, Cardano and XRP saw inflows of $0.7M, $0.43M and $0.13M respectively. Among the top 50 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Bitcoin now sits firmly in the middle of the performance table when considering its price over the last 90 days. While BTC has lost 6.7% of its value in three months, 24 cryptocurrencies have outperformed it, including 19 that have shown positive price movement, such as SOL, XRP and HBAR. According to the Blockchain Center’s Altcoin Season Index , altcoin season starts when 75% of the top 50 coins have performed better than Bitcoin over 90 days.  Significantly, the index has been rising since the beginning of September, and currently sits midway between Bitcoin season and altcoin season, while trending toward the latter. If altcoins continue to shine while Bitcoin underwhelms, the crucial threshold could soon be breached. At its current rate, the altcoin index will surpass 75% within 3 weeks."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,XRP and Dogecoin Fall Off New York Greenlist — What’s Keeping BTC and ETH Unscathed?,https://www.ccn.com/news/xrp-doge-removed-ny-greenlist-btc-eth-resist/,"New York’s Department of Financial Services (DFS) oversees the conduct of companies dealing in virtual currencies. As part of its remit, the agency publishes a “greenlist” of coins that firms may do business with. Until recently, the DFS greenlist  consisted of 25 tokens, ranging from stablecoins to various alt coins including XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE). However, on Monday, September 18, the regulator dramatically altered the makeup of the list. But why? From a list  that contained popular altcoins such as Bitcoin Cash, Chainlink, Dogecoin, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin, Stellar Lumens, Synthetix and XRP, the amended greenlist consists of just 8 approved tokens. Henceforth, virtual asset businesses that want to transact with non-greenlisted coins will need to notify the DFS at least ten days prior to offering the relevant services in the State of New York. After Monday’s redrafting, the greenlist consists of just six stablecoins issued by DFS-registered entities plus Bitcoin and Ethereum. Alongside changes to its greenlist, the DFS has also proposed new guidance for coin-listing policies and enhanced requirements for retail consumer-facing businesses. In a press release  announcing the changes, the DFS wrote that the “proposed guidance for Coin-listing and guidance on the General Framework for Greenlisted Coins enhances the original framework issued by the Department in 2020.” “The enhancements have been developed through ongoing supervision, and the guidance aligns best practices across all entities,” it added. In the updated framework  for greenlisted coins, the DFS said it will consider adding a coin to the Greenlist if:  Regarding the 8 coins that remain on the updated greenlist, 2) explains the presence of stablecoins issued by Gemini, GMO and Paxos. Meanwhile, the first requirement implies that only Bitcoin and Ether have a sufficient history of “safety and soundness.”. While advocates of the recently delisted altcoins may contest their removal from the greenlist on the grounds of safety, the second part of the statement leaves little room for interpretation. Bitcoin and Ether’s position as the two cryptocurrencies with the largest market capitalization has remained uncontested for years. If their large market cap defines the bar for “broad marketplace adoption,” no other token comes close.  Even the world’s most popular stablecoin, USDT, which has the third-largest market cap at over $83B, would need to more than double its circulation in order to compete with ETH for the number two spot. As for BTC, at present, its total circulating supply is at over $500B. And during previous peaks, its market cap has swollen to over a trillion dollars."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Tesla Ready to Accept Bitcoin Again as Clean BTC Mining Energy Breaches 50%,https://www.ccn.com/news/tesla-accept-bitcoin-green-energy-rises/,"When Tesla suspended Bitcoin payments in 2021, citing environmental concerns, CEO Elon Musk said that when miners surpass 50% clean energy, he would reinstate the payment option. Since peaking in mid-2021, Bitcoin emissions have declined by as much as 37.5%, and some analysts report that clean energy provides more than half of all the electricity used for Bitcoin mining globally. Could these developments see Tesla once more embrace BTC? There are several sources of information on the prevalence of clean energy in Bitcoin mining, but they report significantly different results. This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market. When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 13, 2021   On the optimistic side, the Bitcoin Mining Council, whose members represent 43.4% of the global Bitcoin mining network, reported a figure of 59.9%  in August. Meanwhile, in September 2022, researchers at the University of Cambridge’s Center for Alternative Finance (CCAF) concluded  that just 37.6% of the energy used by the Bitcoin blockchain comes from sustainable sources.  Landing somewhere in the middle, a recent Batcoinz report  found that the Bitcoin network now uses a minimum of 52.6% zero-emission energy. Recently, Bloomberg analyst Jamie Couts identified another way of framing the problem. Sustainable Energy Sources Rise >50%👉Falling emissions plus a dramatically rising hash rate can only mean one thing; Bitcoin mining is consuming more sustainable energy in its mix. pic.twitter.com/AGXrKWDWuI  — Jamie Coutts CMT (@Jamie1Coutts) September 14, 2023   As he explained, if mining emissions are falling, yet the Bitcoin hash rate is increasing, the only conclusion is that Bitcoin mining is consuming more sustainable energy in its mix. However, Couts based his analysis on Batcoinz data. The CCAF, on the other hand, observes that although the growth of greenhouse gas emissions created by Bitcoin may be slowing, it’s too early to say that they are declining. With so many conflicting opinions, Musk appears to have erected a difficult bar to meet for Tesla’s adoption of Bitcoin payments.  What’s more, large Bitcoin mining operations are increasingly integrated into electricity grids in a way that “soaks up” additional energy during periods of low demand.  In such instances, although the electricity itself may not have come from clean energy sources, if it would be wasted otherwise, does it really make sense to count it toward overall emissions? So far, neither Tesla nor its CEO have commented on the claims of Batcoinz or the Bitcoin Mining Council, which have both reported that Bitcoin mining has passed the 50% clean energy threshold. However, renewable energy investment is booming.  The impact of billions of dollars of subsidies introduced by the US and the EU in recent years has yet to be felt on global energy markets.  Nevertheless, the large-scale infrastructure projects currently in the pipeline promise to radically transform the ratio of clean versus fossil-fuel-generated electricity in the future. At some point, Musk may be forced to act on his previous commitment. "

Key Takeaways
 The adoption of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, may have a negative effect on important cryptocurrency exchanges. Balchunas emphasized  the benefits of purchasing ETFs rather than trading Bitcoin directly while the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) still needs to approve it. In a recent episode of the “Unchained Crypto” podcast, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas predicted  that, within a few years, purchasing Bitcoin ETFs on stock exchanges would replace conventional crypto purchases. Exchanges that do not adjust their costs to remain competitive will be particularly vulnerable to this trend. Crypto exchanges like Coinbase will likely suffer when the SEC finally approves a spot bitcoin ETF, says @EricBalchunas , senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Do you agree? 🎧 Full episode: https://t.co/8qZzjKFHhj  pic.twitter.com/Oq9oAhsSQJ  — Laura Shin (@laurashin) September 1, 2023   “This is why we say to the crypto exchanges this is going to be a threat to their business. Coinbase and these other exchanges charge a lot per trade,” he said. He added that ETFs have a “long history” of displacing excessive fees and forecasted that this trend will continue over the next five years. “In 3-4 years from now, you are going to be able to buy a liquid cheap Bitcoin ETFs and it is going to be powerful.” Balchunas made it clear that consumers will save money by buying an ETF. He cited the example of the Gold ETF. The charge for this ETF, according to him, is between “35 and 40 basis points,” or roughly 0.35% and 0.40%. In contrast, pricing structures for cryptocurrency exchanges vary, with some giving appealing introductory rates or having no fees for the first month. However, after this initial period, certain exchanges may start charging transaction fees of up to 1.5%. Balchunas added that the investing company “handles all the work” on your behalf. He pointed out that this also entails keeping the digital assets safe and ensuring tax compliance. “It is going to be a very high-value proposition,” he predicted. Balchunas also added he was confident that approval of a Bitcoin ETF will come soon. Many X users, though, quickly defended the notion that ETFs wouldn’t be a threat to exchanges. One person said : “I disagree, there will always be a place for decentralized exchanges. Sure the bottom line could be impacted, but this just caters for a different audience, with a different level of risk.” Balchunas has maintained his belief that a Bitcoin ETF will be approved by the US SEC. On August 30, following the court decision that the SEC erred in rejecting Grayscale’s application for a Bitcoin ETF, he said : “James Sayffart and I are upping our odds to 75% of spot Bitcoin ETFs launching this year (95% by end of ’24). While we factored Grayscale win into our previous 65% odds, the unanimity and decisiveness of ruling was beyond expectations and leaves SEC with very little wiggle room.” Recently, the SEC decided to postpone making a decision on seven applications to launch Bitcoin ETFs. The hearing for the decision is now scheduled for mid-October. After losing to Grayscale Investments in a legal battle, the SEC must approve multiple companies’ spot Bitcoin ETF applications, say JP Morgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. A federal court’s ruling requires the SEC to reevaluate its decision to reject Grayscale’s attempt to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF. Court labeled SEC’s decision as “arbitrary and capricious” because the organization failed to provide justification for the disparate treatment of spot and futures-based Bitcoin ETFs. The analyst opined that the SEC would need to revoke its earlier approvals of futures-based ETFs in order to deny Grayscale’s applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF and a trust conversion. The primary advantage of cryptocurrency ETFs over direct investments is that investors can avoid handling the underlying assets. While cryptocurrency exchanges have simplified the process, barriers to widespread adoption remain, such as managing digital wallets and understanding private and public keys. Cryptocurrency ETFs enable investors to access this asset class through their existing brokerage accounts. All ETFs are subject to strict regulation because they are traded on conventional exchanges. As a result, authorities can keep an eye on and evaluate their performance while also guarding against price gouging on the ETF markets. Traditional cryptocurrency exchanges can be vulnerable to price manipulation and security risks, including theft and hacking. Crypto ETFs provide insulation from these risks since you don’t own the underlying cryptocurrency, and some ETFs use futures backing. Building a diverse cryptocurrency portfolio involves creating accounts on multiple exchanges and managing numerous digital wallets, a time-consuming and complex process. Crypto ETFs offer exposure to a range of assets through a single investment, albeit indirectly, and often at lower fees compared to traditional managed funds. The SEC asserted that the size or maturity of the Bitcoin market was insufficient to support ETF market demand when it initially rejected VanEck’s spot Bitcoin ETF. The regulator added that the market might be vulnerable to fraud and manipulation due to the price volatility and insufficient level of trading oversight. BlackRock’s entry, however, has led some market analysts to assume that there is a significant probability that SEC will approve a spot Bitcoin ETF. The difference between a futures ETF and a digital asset itself is that the first is based on futures contracts. It is simpler for the SEC to approve such ETFs because the futures markets are already extensively regulated to avoid market manipulation. The issuer’s demand to include a “surveillance-sharing agreement” with a sufficiently substantial and regulated Bitcoin-related market lies at the core of these spot ETF rejections. These agreements are essential for enabling the SEC to carry out thorough investigations should there be any market irregularities. One major concern leading to the rejection of spot Bitcoin ETFs is the regulator’s ability to oversee and ensure continuous asset safety and custody. To address this, the United States must enhance its legal and regulatory framework to instill confidence in the SEC and other parties involved in permitting an ETF provider to manage it."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,"Bitcoin Isn’t a Security, But Other Cryptos are? – We Speak to the Lawyers",https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-isnt-a-security-but-other-cryptos-are/,"Legal uncertainty continues to cloud several of the cryptocurrency ecosystem’s most influential blockchains and respective tokens after high-profile enforcement actions from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC has been a common feature of news headlines through 2023, with its decision to institute legal action against Binance.US and Coinbase raising concerns of far-reaching consequences for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Key arguments laid out by the SEC against the two major exchange operators in the U.S. include allegations that many cryptocurrency tokens are deemed to be securities offerings. Both Binance.US and Coinbase are facing a raft of charges for allegedly operating as unregistered securities exchanges.  The SEC’s allegations against Coinbase also list the likes of Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) as unregistered securities on the exchange, which had a marked effect on the value of these smart contract blockchain ecosystem tokens over the past few months. The legal considerations are broad, with the SEC arguing that many cryptocurrency ecosystems and their tokens are securities and should fall under its remit. In having not registered with the agency, the likes of ADA, SOL, and MATIC have potentially fallen foul of its regulations. CCN reached out to legal experts to unpack how the SEC has approached Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency ecosystem and what makes BTC exempt from being classified as a security while other tokens are currently in the crosshairs of the U.S. watchdog. Preston Byrne has been advising technology companies on commercial law as a partner at BrownRudnick , with a keen focus on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. He tells CCN that the question of whether a token is a security or not is a legal consideration which depends on the facts and circumstances surrounding its creation and existence through the application of legal precedent.  Byrne notes that the only entity entitled to make this type of determination in a legally binding way is a U.S. judge or jury. “The SEC seems to have concluded, in my view correctly, that Bitcoin doesn’t satisfy these criteria, as evidenced by the total absence of enforcement action in this area and some offhand remarks by then-SEC Chair Jay Clayton in 2018 and subsequently by current SEC Chair Gary Gensler,” Byrne said. Byrne says that despite the SEC not making any official judgments on Bitcoin itself, arguments that the preeminent cryptocurrency does not meet the criteria of the long-established Howey Test have seen the SEC lean towards this direction of classification. “The three-prong Howey test requires a finding that a contract, transaction, or scheme needs an investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits arising from the efforts of others. There are colorable arguments for Bitcoin and indeed many other coins also that not all these elements are present.” Byrne adds that the SEC is taking a stern position on MATIC, SOL, and ADA in the Coinbase litigation. However, the judicial fact-finder, either a judge or jury, would be “in the driver’s seat” in terms of deciding whether the U.S. exchange is operating an unregistered securities exchange or not. David Hoppe, the managing partner of Gamma Law , gave a more detailed breakdown of how Bitcoin does not fall within the scope of the SEC’s Howey Test. He outlines the SEC’s decision to not deem Bitcoin as a security based on the Howey Test based on four factors: Hoppe notes the SEC concluded that Bitcoin did not meet the second factor, reasoning that Bitcoin is not a common enterprise because it is not managed by a central authority but by a decentralized network controlled by its users. “Bitcoin is not a financial investment. It is not a claim on the future profits of a company or project. Bitcoin is not sold with the expectation of profits from the efforts of others. Its value is determined by supply and demand, not by the efforts of developers or manager,” Hoppe said. Having outlined why the SEC does not view Bitcoin as a securities offering, Hoppe then touched on the agency’s view on other tokens perceived to be securities.  The SEC has not publicly stated the specific criteria it uses to determine whether a cryptocurrency is a security, but Hoppe put forward three factors that the agency is using to make these determinations.  Hoppe notes that the level of centralized control is one aspect. Where Bitcoin is decentralized in nature, other tokens are managed by a core team. “This is in contrast to other cryptocurrencies, such as MATIC and SOL (at least), which are arguably controlled by central development teams or large holders,” Hoppe said.  The purpose of a cryptocurrency is another consideration for the SEC. Given that Bitcoin was created as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, BTC was not intended to be held for capital appreciation, which Byrne suggests is at odds with tokens under SEC scrutiny. “MATIC, SOL, and ADA are all designed to be used in decentralized applications, but arguably intended to provide a capital appreciation opportunity.” He adds that the SEC has taken the position that the marketing of a cryptocurrency can be a factor in determining whether it is a security. If a cryptocurrency is marketed as an investment, then it is more likely to be considered a security.  From a legal perspective, there is consensus that Bitcoin is not judged to be a security. However, the status of the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem, which features a plethora of tokens operating on a variety of multi-purpose blockchains, is not so clear cut. Byrne believes that SEC has been forthcoming about the logic behind its recent enforcement actions against the likes of Coinbase, Binance.US as well as the ongoing Ripple/XRP court case. This is despite not providing more detailed information about how the likes of ADA, SOL and MATIC have been ruled as unregistered securities. “Its reasoning is fairly clear. The SEC waited a very long time to take the position it did regarding altcoins and exchanges – roughly 10 years – but the interpretation they have adopted is one which was within their power to adopt,” Byrne said. Meanwhile, Hoppe says the SEC could have been more forthcoming with its reasoning behind its decisions to label a number of tokens as securities in recent lawsuits. However, there are reasons why there has been a perceived lack of regularity clarity from the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). “The nature of cryptocurrency is still evolving. Cryptocurrency is a relatively new technology and business model, and its legal status is still being debated. This makes it difficult for regulators to develop clear rules for the sector,” Hoppe said. He also notes that the global nature of the cryptocurrency market makes it difficult for regulators to coordinate efforts and develop consistent rules. From a U.S. perspective, Hoppe says that the SEC and CFTC have different views on how to regulate cryptocurrency.  “The SEC has taken a more aggressive approach to regulating cryptocurrency, while the CFTC has taken a more hands-off approach. This has led to confusion and uncertainty in the market.” This has led to a number of challenges for the cryptocurrency sector. Instances of crypto-related companies struggling to raise capital and list their tokens on exchanges is a prime example. While the U.S. cryptocurrency ecosystem has expressed fears that regulatory oversight in the country will drive businesses abroad and negatively effect the industry, Hoppe anticipates clearer regulatory guidelines for in the near future. “The SEC and CFTC have been working on developing regulations for cryptocurrency, and there is a growing consensus among regulators that a regulatory framework needs to be developed for cryptocurrency in order to provide clarity for companies in the space, protect investors and reduce the risk of fraud,” Hoppe said. Hoppe added that the SEC could be more forthcoming with the industry to address repeated concerns. This could be done by providing more detailed explanations of its reasoning in its lawsuits, publishing guidance on how to comply with securities laws for cryptocurrency companies as well as holding public hearings on the regulation of cryptocurrency.  This would allow the SEC to hear from a variety of stakeholders and to get feedback on its proposed regulations."
2024-04-11 14:24:00+00:00,Crypto ETF Application Labels Bitcoin Fund as “Fully Decarbonized”,https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto-etf-application-labels-bitcoin-fund-as-fully-decarbonized/,"The recent addition of an ESG certification to a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by a London-based money manager has environmental experts scratching their heads. As an Article 8 fund, according to EU laws, Jacobi Asset Management’s Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF is required to “promote” ESG. It is the most recent addition to the Article 8 fund class, which currently includes assets totaling approximately $6 trillion  spread over an ever-expanding range of financial products. According to statistics , the EU’s environmental, social, and governance investing criteria have never before been applied to an ETF whose main objective is to allow investors to speculate on the value of Bitcoin. The chief executive of Jacobi, Martin Bednall, a former official at BlackRock Inc., has assured investors that the ETF will be “fully decarbonized .” According to Bednall , the ETF qualifies as an ESG product due to investments in renewable energy certificates. The plan is for Jacobi to buy enough renewable energy certificates (RECs) to offset the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy required to mine the Bitcoin that the ETF tracks. There aren’t many activities that use as much energy as mine for Bitcoin. According to estimates, the computer power required to extract units of the cryptocurrency consumes about 140 terawatt-hours (TWh) a year , or roughly as much as Norway produced  in 2022. Compared to an industry estimate of roughly 60%, the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance believes  that only 38% of Bitcoin mining is carried out using renewable and nuclear energy. Using RECs to carry out a decarbonization strategy, according to Matthew Brander, senior lecturer in carbon accounting at the University of Edinburgh Business School, “isn’t credible.” “Buying a REC doesn’t represent any real-world relationship between digital assets and renewable power,” he said . Anders Bjrn, lead author of a RECs research  published in Nature Climate Change, a peer-reviewed science magazine, claims that’s especially true when the RECs are unbundled, as is the situation with the Jacobi certificates. The decarbonization claim “is only credible if Jacobi Asset Management can show that their purchasing of RECs causes an equivalent amount of renewable energy to be generated,” Bjrn stated . As the corporation acquires unbundled RECs to match the electricity use from Bitcoin mining, “that seems highly unlikely.” Bednall claims  that after considering his alternatives, Jacobi chose RECs despite concerns of market tools used to reduce carbon emissions. “RECs were preferred over offsets, as the most material part of our carbon footprint is in relation to the electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network,” he said. According to Bednall, Guernsey and Amsterdam were chosen as the ETF’s domicile and listing locations because other countries’ regulatory requirements were too onerous. The Financial Conduct Authority’s limitations have prevented access to the London Stock Exchange, he claimed. In the meanwhile, according  to Bednall, Jacobi is considering cross-listing the ETF on more European exchanges and is also “having conversations in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.” The Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF launched  in more than a year after its initial 2022 debut date. The launch was marketed as the first spot, or physically-backed, Bitcoin fund, giving investors the chance to access a financial service backed by real Bitcoins. The eco-friendliness  of the ETF was underlined right away by Jacobi Asset Management. The fund determines how much energy the Bitcoin network consumes using external data. Then, it buys RECs and “retires” them. These certificates are tracked on a blockchain platform that enables investors to verify the fund’s claims about its environmental friendliness. The ESG Bitcoin ETF has garnered a little over $1 million in investments since going public  in mid-August, while the price of Bitcoin has fallen by more than 10%."

Morgan Interest,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitfinex-cto-paolo-ardoino-highlights-el-salvador-success/,"When El Salvador adopted  Bitcoin as a legal payment, Nayib Bukele, the country’s president, alarmed many Wall Street investors. However, Paolo Ardoino, Bitfinex’ CTO claims it is a clear sign of the government’s support and policy. Ardoino might be right because two years later, the bond rally Bukele is in charge of is proving to be too profitable to pass up. A spokesperson from Bitfinex told CCN the company was seeing 70% returns and that it had garnered interest from the likes of  J.P. Morgan. Among others who have suggested purchasing, or purchased the debt, betting that it will keep rising, are also Eaton Vance and PGIM Fixed Income, according to Bitfinex.  President Nayib Bukele responded to the revised growth prognosis on Twitter (X) by writing, “I told you so,” in reference to earlier forecasts by other agencies that the nation would not experience growth this year. I will not say “I told you so” 😂 pic.twitter.com/LjbSGZUeEr  — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) August 11, 2023   Bukele declared  on November 17, 2022, that starting that day, they would be purchasing 1 BTC daily. El Salvador now holds 2,924 Bitcoins with a market value of about $85.3 million. The investment is, however, down over 30%, with a BTC cost average of $41,240. J.P. Morgan’s report emphasizes the strong momentum seen in industries like construction. “Although we missed a significant share of the rally, we still think there’s value across El Salvador’s curve,” J.P. Morgan research strategists Ben Ramsey, Nishant Poojary, and Gorka Lalaguna wrote in a July report  adding that “there’s room for this credit to keep outperforming.” Additionally, J.P. Morgan highlighted the “impressive” pattern of declining budget deficits despite rising public investment. This accomplishment is especially notable because it defies expectations and shows how successfully El Salvador’s budget management strategies work. Paolo Ardoino, Bitfinex’s CTO’s told CCN that the outperformance it has been seen in El Salvador bonds is a clear signal that investors are supportive of the financial policies of the El Salvador government and demonstrates the renewed interest in investing in the El Salvador story, where crime is being combated, and the country’s finances are well managed. “As the first company to receive a Digital Asset Licence, we are seeing significant interest in digital asset issuance and renewable energy investments, which the country has in abundance and is being used for Bitcoin mining and to provide more energy for the country’s electrical grid,” Ardoino stated. J.P. Morgan’s revised outlook is consistent with El Salvador’s recent string of encouraging economic statistics. Increased economic activity, restrained inflation, and prudent fiscal management all appear to point the nation toward sustained growth. The updated growth prediction is a vote of confidence in El Salvador’s economic policies and their potential to produce positive results as the country continues to navigate its economic environment. With the crypto companies coming over, El Salvador appears to be moving toward a more wealthy future as the economy is being driven forward by industries like construction, and fiscal responsibility is still a top concern."

Key Takeaways
 Jacobi Asset Management just launched the first Bitcoin spot ETF in Europe . Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF not only marks a transformation in the European crypto market but also pushes forward the environmental sustainability efforts that support the longevity of the trade in the region.  Although initially planned for launch in July 2022 on Euronext Amsterdam, the ETF was postponed till August 2023 due to market instability caused by the collapse of FTX and Terraform Labs. The ETF, overseen by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC), trades under the ticker (BCOIN). The regulating body will ensure that the ETF complies with EU crypto regulations, while Flow Traders will take the responsibility of making market-making decisions. On top of that, Jane Street and DRW have been officially placed as authorized participants. In his announcement , Martin Bednall, CEO of Jacobi Asset Management, said, “The Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF represents the world’s first SFDR Article 8 decarbonized digital asset fund. Jacobi in partnership with Zumo has implemented a verifiable, regulated, built-in Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) solution which allows institutional investors to access the benefits of Bitcoin whilst also meeting ESG goals.” To which Kirsteen Harrison, Environmental Manager, Zumo, added, “The decarbonisation of crypto is one of the most pressing challenges facing the nascent digital assets sector, and there is increasing pressure on all businesses to have credible plans to decarbonize.  “We’ve been working closely with Jacobi Asset Management to help them build out an ESG-aligned, future-proofed crypto offering for their customers. It’s hugely exciting to see it come to life in the shape of Europe’s first Bitcoin ETF. We’re creating the investment products of tomorrow – what a moment for the industry.” The efforts above comply with the rigorous regulatory measures put forth by the European Union. The political party maintained a forward-thinking approach when developing the regulatory structure for digital asset trading. Hence, the European Union had to factor in institutions, customers, local economics, and the environmental impact of the industry. Jacobi Asset Management did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Considering the scale of Jacobi Asset Management’s announcement, the emergence of Europe’s first Bitcoin spot ETF should’ve had a resounding impact on the price of Bitcoin, but that was not the case. Bitcoin spot ETFs allow investors to invest their funds into Bitcoin’s evolving pricing future. As Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, once put it: Bitcoin ETFs are meant to “democratize crypto,” allowing a more comprehensive range of investors to get involved in the market.  Spot ETFs are meant to provide access to crypto investing to everyday investors without needing to buy the asset itself, removing the financial entry barrier for many potential entrants.  If spot ETFs are truly going to change the landscape of Bitcoin investment, then why didn’t the announcement impact Bitcoin prices? When Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF was announced, Bitcoin was priced at around $29,300. At the time this article was written, Bitcoin was priced at $29,148. It would be difficult to attribute the drop in Bitcoin’s value to the ETF’s announcement. However, the announcement seemingly did not impact Bitcoin positively.  Many major asset managers have submitted their Bitcoin spot ETF applications to the US Securities and Exchange Commission for assessment. The likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Investment are now waiting patiently for the regulating commission, led by Gary Gensler, to provide a definitive response to their applications. But, if Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF’s announcement is anything to go by, there’s a chance that spot ETF approvals in the US might not have the impact many have perceived to be certain.  However, Reports  claim ETFs currently hold 10% of the total crypto market value. Granted, BlackRock’s announcement of applying for such an ETF sent Bitcoin surging by $4,000 immediately. But, the regulatory environment created by the SEC has been nothing short of challenging for the market. As a result, the hype slowed down around the announcement. Moreover, many stakeholders are now losing faith in spot ETFs actually receiving approval from the regulating body as the SEC recently announced  it will be delaying spot ETF approvals. “The hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States has introduced an unpredictable operating environment impacting the entire American business community,” reads a Tweet  from Binance.US’ Twitter account.  https://t.co/AZwoBOgsqS  has made the difficult decision to exercise its right to terminate the asset purchase agreement with Voyager.

As a result, Binance was forced to halt all USD trades and suspend OTC trades, and trade pairs. While Binance’s case does not represent the overall picture of crypto struggles in the US regulatory environment, it showcases the results of the lack of clarity provided by the SEC. Multiple crypto institutions have already faced SEC litigations due to this fact. Coinbase, the biggest US-based exchange, is now facing a lawsuit filed by the regulating body for allegedly trading in unregistered securities.  The same claim has been made on several occasions, such as with Ripple, simply due to the fact that the SEC has yet to create a clear guideline for digital asset trading. For that very reason, the SEC is now facing a slew of opposition, comprised of crypto institutions, members of the government, and even accredited academics.  On the other hand, the EU has exhausted considerable amounts of time and energy to create a regulatory environment that ensures the safety of customers and businesses alike and creates a stable platform on which crypto businesses can continue to develop technology and trade."

According to data , he is being trailed by the conservative Together for Change (Juntos por el Cambio) party, which has just under 30% of the vote. With little more than 28.5% of the vote, the coalition representing the current administration, the left-leaning Union for the Homeland (Unión por la Patria), is in third place.

In his dramatic post-election speech, Milei said : “We are the true opposition. A different Argentina is impossible with the same old things that have always failed.” Milei, who describes himself as an anarcho-capitalist, has advocated  for the abolition of Argentina’s central bank and described the sale of human organs as “just another market.” According to him, Bitcoin is a response to “central bank scammers” and fiat money enables governments to defraud Argentineans through inflation. Javier Milei is running for President of Argentina. He appears to understand money, and that inflation is an unfair mechanism that advantages elites over the people and slowly robs people of their means of survival. pic.twitter.com/tj0KEztUzI  — Alex Stanczyk ∞/21m (@alexstanczyk) January 5, 2023   For him, Bitcoin represents liberty and financial freedom. In his estimation of Bitcoin’s potential, “Bitcoin represents the return of money to its original creator: the private sector.” He said : “Bitcoin is the natural reaction against Central Bank scammers, and to make money private again.” With an annual inflation rate  of 116%, the worst in over three decades, and a crisis in the cost of living, such rhetoric has found favor with Argentina’s voters. Milei labeled his previous promise to “blow it up ,” which he made last year in an effort to defraud “good people” through inflationary taxation, a hoax. Although the Central Bank of the nation recently banned digital wallets , little has changed in the booming crypto industry, which, according to Chainalysis , places Argentina’s use of cryptocurrencies at 13th globally. The latest judgment states that digital wallets in Argentina are not permitted to “carry out or facilitate operations with digital assets, including crypto assets.” The “mitigating the risks” to the general public and the financial system was the central bank’s justification for its choice. The country’s top digital wallet, Mercado Pago, is projected to be most impacted by the rule. A similar product had already been launched in Brazil by Mercado Libre’s digital bank and rival Nubank, both of which swiftly attracted one million subscribers. The general presidential election in Argentina will take place on October 22. A run-off election will be place in November if no candidate receives at least 45% of the vote. Milei was brought up in court for allegedly endorsing Coinx , an Argentinean Ponzi scam that is accused of taking at least $800,000 in pesos. Milei then insisted that the business operated just like a bank and denied  any misconduct. Although some  in the cryptocurrency community are hoping Milei will advocate for a Bitcoin standard akin to El Salvador or other such pro-crypto policies, the eccentric presidential candidate might not be that willing. For instance, he declared  his plans to “dollarize” the Argentine economy just last month."

Key Takeaways
 On Monday, Cathie Wood, Ark Invest CEO, and CIO, speculated  that the US Securities and Exchange Commission might approve multiple spot ETF applications at once. The veteran investor had earlier claimed  that her company might be the first to receive ETF approval considering it was the first in line for the application. This comes at a time when financial titans such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Valkyrie are also waiting in anticipation for their spot ETFs to receive SEC approval. If Wood’s prediction is true, BTC might rally to $100,00, as some experts are speculating. Just last month, Cathie Wood claimed  that her company ARK Invest would be the first to receive SEC approval on its spot ETF application.  “21Shares, ARK and Cboe are first in line because their next SEC decision date is 8/13/23 and we don’t yet have a date for the other 19b-4 applications like the one from BlackRock,” claimed Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart. “ARK and 21Shares filed an application with the SEC for a bitcoin ETF that now is the only one ahead of BlackRock’s,” reported ARK Investment Management analyst Yassine Elmandjra. Now, Wood predicts  that the SEC will rather approve several ETF applications at once. “I think the SEC, if it’s going to approve a Bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once.” Many financial institutions had to refile for their spot ETFs, most of them naming Coinbase as a surveillance partner in hopes that it would finally help them overcome the SEC’s anti-money laundering barrier.  CCN reached out to Cathie Wood for commentary but did not receive a reply at the time of publishing But, if Cathie’s right about all of this, how would that affect the market? Earlier this month, Blockstream’s CEO Adam Back, one of the early cryptocurrency pioneers, made a bold claim that Bitcoin’s price would reach $100,000 by April 2024 and that he’s certain of it. the bet is on🚀: i bet #bitcoin  reaches or exceeds $100k between now and halving (31st Mar 2024) with @vikingobitcoin9  1million sats to the winner. https://t.co/Ij7iPEYjQW  pic.twitter.com/PNpAaZvl8F  — Adam Back (@adam3us) August 5, 2023   Back’s prediction focused on a deadline for that $100,000 mark, which is by the next Bitcoin Halving, set to be in April 2024. Who knows? Back might be right. If the aforementioned ETF applications go through smoothly, the market will likely respond correctly. Signs of such market optimism have already taken place such as when BlackRock announced its plans to file for a spot ETF and the price of Bitcoin shot up by $4,000. But predictions such as Back’s are something everyone should be cautious of. The optimistic CEO is also betting on the future of Bitcoin, claiming  it will reach the $10 million mark by 2032. early this year i was curious of the claim ""bitcoin 2x's per year on average"". it checks: the decade jan 2013 – dec 2022 #bitcoin  went up 2.036x/year (1200x in a decade). if that continues we'll cross $10mil/BTC and $200 tril market cap by end of next 2 halvenings, about 9 years. pic.twitter.com/mqmO2SRdAv  — Adam Back (@adam3us) February 12, 2023  "
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,Bitcoin Price to Hit $100k Before April 2024 Halving: Adam Back,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-100k-before-april-2024-halving-adam-back/,"The Bitcoin halving is a significant event that impacts market mood, miner profitability, and innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. According to Adam Back, it should also grow the currency price. The crypto community is already weighing in with various predictions on Bitcoin’s potential price with less than a year to go. One of the early cryptocurrency pioneers, Blockstream’s CEO Adam Back, is certain that Bitcoin will reach an all-time high of over $100,000 before it is halved in April 2024 and is willing to stake 1 million Satoshis on it (a hundredth of a Bitcoin, or around $290 at current prices) In a chat on X  (formerly known as Twitter) on August 7, Back and anonymous X user @Vikingobbitcoin settled on a wager that Bitcoin will hit $100,000 by March 31, 2024. According to Vinkingo , it probably won’t occur until 2025. CCN reached out to Adam Back for commentary but did not receive a reply at the time of publishing Back predicts that the price will “probably” achieve a new all-time high before the halves, which is scheduled  for April 26. This puts the wagered date close to a month before the splitting. Huge sums have previously been wagered on sharp increases in the price of Bitcoin, such as Balaji Srinivasan ‘s $1 million 90-day Bitcoin wager in March. Additionally, Back has previously expressed optimism about Bitcoin, stating in February that it might hit $10 million by the sixth halving in 2032. He then mentioned  that the flagship crypto asset could explode to a $200 trillion market cap in the next nine years. early this year i was curious of the claim ""bitcoin 2x's per year on average"". it checks: the decade jan 2013 – dec 2022 #bitcoin  went up 2.036x/year (1200x in a decade). if that continues we'll cross $10mil/BTC and $200 tril market cap by end of next 2 halvenings, about 9 years. pic.twitter.com/mqmO2SRdAv  — Adam Back (@adam3us) February 12, 2023   This time, Back is investing his own money to support his most recent assertion. Unfortunately, instead of dollars, it’s a million satoshis currently, but, if Back’s forecast comes true — he will receive more than $1,000. The smallest division of a Bitcoin is called a satoshi, or “sat” for short. There are 100 million sats in a single BTC. Given that Back’s net worth is thought to be somewhere between $50 and $300 million , it is therefore a relatively minor wager for him. Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3 and a fellow Bitcoiner, responded to Back’s original article by stating that he too anticipates a new all-time high for Bitcoin, but “pre-halving, not post.” the bet is on🚀: i bet #bitcoin  reaches or exceeds $100k between now and halving (31st Mar 2024) with @vikingobitcoin9  1million sats to the winner. https://t.co/Ij7iPEYjQW  pic.twitter.com/PNpAaZvl8F  — Adam Back (@adam3us) August 5, 2023   Back’s little wager has received some sarcastic comments ; nonetheless, it still indicates an increasing bullish tendency among market pundits and analysts on the price of Bitcoin ahead of next year’s halving. adam please let me know if you need help financing that $300 bet — Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) August 5, 2023   Like David Chaum and Hal Finney, Adam Back is a “British cryptographer and cypherpunk” from London who was “a pioneer of early digital asset research.” He created the cryptographic hash-based proof-of-work technique Hashcash  in 1997. When mining, Bitcoin uses the hashcash proof-of-work function as the mining core, and Bitcoin miners are expending their effort creating hashcash proof-of-work, which acts as a vote in the blockchain evolution and validate the blockchain transaction log. When giving his predictions, Back usually talks about the macro factors that he believes will make his price prediction come true. In short, he seems to think that the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the U.S., is responsible for all the factors that define Bitcoin price. Such a macroeconomic view  differentiates him from the crypto experts, who usually focus only on crypto and not the whole ecosystem per se. everyone has their pet macro-views. my guess: stock market + US election season, moral hazard kicks up, QE ramps up again, rates drop again, money printer goes into over-drive. so the interest rate overhang falls off. and BTC decorrelates somewhere along the way once defi flushed — Adam Back (@adam3us) June 16, 2022   Also, it’s good to know that Back primarily used two methods to amass his wealth. First, by purchasing Bitcoin in 2011, when one cost between $0.70 and $15. Even a modest purchase made at the time for $10,000 would be worth more than $30 million now. Adam Back did a fantastic job of capitalizing on his early interest in and exposure to the cypherpunk movement by investing very early in Bitcoin and creating a billion-dollar business in the same industry. He has been fortunate enough to amass a sizeable net worth from his endeavors, maybe between $100 and $300 million. Following a halving, there is typically an uptick in volatility for Bitcoin. With less Bitcoin in circulation, its value rises, and investors find it more desirable. When examining the post-halving booms in Bitcoin, other factors should be taken into account: If you trust in the importance of history, previous Bitcoin price halvings have been long-term bullish factors for the cryptocurrency. On the other hand, the subsequent halving will almost certainly have various effects on the BTC ecosystem. The number of Bitcoin miners is generally expected to fall as the financial incentive to mine diminishes and, for less skilled miners, becomes unprofitable."

Key Takeaways
 Data from CryptoQuant  shows that Bitcoin trading activity increased by 24% in July, reaching over $940 million. Volumes in bitcoin (BTC) options also increased by 16.6% to $734 million, while ether (ETH) options registered a 60% increase to $207 million.  Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) reports a substantial increase in Bitcoin options trading. However, the price of Bitcoin still floats somewhere around $29,000 per token despite increased trading activity.  CME reports Bitcoin options trading significantly increased during July. The investment option provides investors with the right to buy or sell a digital asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. The Exchange gives buyers the option to buy or sell one cryptocurrency futures contract at a specific price at some future date. CME offers both Bitcoin and Ether options based on the exchange’s cash-settled standard and micro BTC and ETH futures contracts. 
“The increase in BTC options volume on the CME suggests that institutions might be hedging their positions with options as uncertainty remains in the market,” according to a CCData report . Ever since the $4,000 price increase for Bitcoin due to BlackRock’s ETF application, the token has not seen any further increases. As a matter of fact, BTC has dropped by almost 4% in value throughout July. The ETF application that led to a tidal wave of financial institutions applying for similar ETFs was at risk of rejection until the world’s largest asset manager refiled its application, naming Coinbase as its surveillance partner. However, since then, there has been almost no news about the application and investors are starting to show signs of doubt. As a result, many investors are now opting for BTC and ETH options, rather than futures contracts.  CCData shows a 17.6% drop in Futures volume on CME to $39.1 billion. Simultaneously, total derivatives trading volume (futures and options) dropped to $40.1 billion. The market is already showing signs of optimism following Ripple’s triumph during its SEC litigation. Other crypto institutions such as Coinbase are now hopeful of the outcome of their own SEC lawsuits. While a win for these institutions might signal a more stable crypto market, it’ll take more than that to give BTC the push it needs. For one, many stakeholders, both private and governmental, are calling for clear crypto regulations that would help crypto institutions and investors navigate the market while avoiding legal challenges. Second, the market is obviously in anticipation of BlackRock and Co’s ETF applications to go through. If the SEC somehow manages to process said applications smoothly, the market is likely to witness a surge of activity in expectations for an almost definite increase in BTC pricing."

Key Takeaways
 Many crypto exchanges are now working toward integrating the Bitcoin Lightning Network  into their platforms, aiming to reduce transaction fees and processing times. Data  shows that BLT relies on several centralized cloud services, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud, for data processing. But, why would decentralized crypto institutions opt for centralized cloud services as the basis of their token transactions? Data from Mempool  shows that BLT relies in the capacities of 19% on Google Cloud and 29% on AWS for transaction processing. DataWeb Global Group also carries over 12% of BLT’s load.  The reliance on such cloud services aims to avoid risks posed by depending on individual BLT nodes.  Through the Bitcoin Lightning Network transactions can take place in a decentralized manner if both parties involved are online. Should one of the parties go offline, funds may be lost in the process. By relying on centralized cloud services such as AWS, such risks can be mitigated as the platform handles transaction data instead. A form of company is now emerging in the crypto space called Lightning as a Service (LaaS). Among the prominent names in the LaaS industry is Voltage. Google recently announced  its partnership with Voltage to offer “enterprises with a Lightning Network solution that enables the settlement of real-time payments with near-zero fees, enabling organizations to send and receive payments while creating new experiences and business models.” The announcement states that “Voltage is working with Google Cloud to expand hosting providers and locations. Through this collaboration, customers can create Bitcoin and Lightning Nodes in Google Cloud at various locations worldwide. Customers can deploy their workloads globally via two leading providers using Voltage and Google Cloud.” Finally, the announcement clarifies the purpose behind the partnership, claiming that it would:  CCN reached out to Voltage for commentary but did not receive a reply at the time of publishing.

 In a recent tweet , Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s CEO, announced the company’s plans to integrate the Bitcoin Lightning Network into the platform.  The announcement comes at a time when Coinbase is making strides to establish its dominance in the crypto market by partnering up with key asset managers. Following recent news, such as Ripple’s win against the SEC, Coinbase has been experiencing stock price surges, signaling a bright future for the exchange. In the meantime, Coinbase’s main competitor, Binance, has been struggling to stabilize its operations in the West, showing signs of shifting operations to Eastern nations.

The world’s biggest crypto exchange already beat Coinbase to the punch by integrating BLT about a month ago.  However, Binance, overall, is not doing well on the legal side. The company has yet to reach any positive outcome on its SEC lawsuits, including very serious allegations, such as wash trading and evading U.S regulators.  If anything, SEC litigation will likely lead to federal cases being filed against Binance and company founder Changpeng Zhao. CZ is seemingly preparing an army of legal experts to get him out of such a bind, hopefully. Binance and CZ are even attempting to dismiss a lawsuit filed against the company by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). On top of it all, Binance has almost completely departed the European market. With the company exiting crypto markets in the UK, Germany, France, Cyprus, and others, it’s quite unlikely that it will return to the market. Instead, Binance is now finding refuge in Asian markets as it expands in Japan and Hong Kong. It’s not like Coinbase is free of regulatory litigation, either. The exchange is currently dealing with a lawsuit by the SEC of its own. The regulating body is claiming that the company traded in ‘unregistered securities’ and has already commenced hearings on the case. However, Armstrong seems rather optimistic about the outcome of the lawsuit. He sees the Ripple case ruling by Judge Torres as a positive sign that Coinbase has a good chance of winning its own case.  W. W for @ripple .W for the industry.W for the builders.W for a clear rulebook.W for updating the system. Oh, and XRP is now open for trading. — Coinbase 🛡️ (@coinbase) July 13, 2023   Coinbase’s situation in the crypto market is hopeful, to say the least. The exchange now has its faith tethered to major Wall Street asset managers such as BlackRock who are attempting to enter the crypto market. The exchange has been named as a “surveillance partner” on multiple ETF applications as part of a plan to fulfill the SEC’s anti-money laundering conditions. Considering the company’s current developments with the Bitcoin Lightning Network, Wall Street associations, as well as an upwards trend in the company’s stock price following Ripple’s win, it’s difficult to see how Coinbase would not eventually dethrone Binance to become the world’s leading crypto exchange."

Key Takeaways
 A report  released by KMPG, one of the world’s main services network adjacent to the likes of PWC, highlights the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining. The study uses data from Harvard Business Review, showing that Bitcoin mining has a minuscule environmental impact compared with the fashion and gold mining industries.  Some may remember Elon Musk removing Bitcoin as a payment option from his flagship company Tesla. At the time, he claimed  that Bitcoin mining was incredibly bad for the environment, adding, “We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.” Tesla & Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/YSswJmVZhP  — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 12, 2021   This came at a time when Tesla offloaded most of its Bitcoin deposits, which led the flagship cryptocurrency to take a dive in price.  However, KPMG’s report shows that Bitcoin mining has far fewer consequences on the environment compared to other industries, such as fashion, gold mining, and, most certainly, automobile manufacturing.  “Bitcoin mining industry has become extremely competitive. Under this competitive landscape, miners are incentivized to streamline their operations and carefully manage production costs.  As electricity is the largest ongoing input cost affecting operations, miners are constantly searching for the lowest cost sources of electricity, which is often tied to underutilized hydro, wind, or solar,” according to KMPG’s report. According to an article  by the World Economic Forum, “Crypto mining can be a catalyst or market driver for new renewable energy projects.” The article also claims that “It is this symbiosis of crypto computer farms and remote green energy projects which offers the potential for mutual benefits — and it may not stop with rural projects.” KMPG’s report states that “Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which is the process of adding transactions to the blockchain by being the first to solve a mathematical problem via computation. This math problem involves repeatedly hashing a block of transactions until a specific output is achieved.  Hashing is the process of taking any string of text as an input and converting it to a fixed-length alphanumeric output.  Given that this is a one-way function, it means that the same input will always result in the same output, but the input cannot be determined with the output alone. Solving this math problem is essentially trying to find a needle in a haystack.  Miners who solve the puzzle first are awarded freshly minted Bitcoin (currently 6.25 Bitcoin per block) as well as any transaction fees which currently account for about 2-3% of miner revenue” In a nutshell, Bitcoin miners use their computing power to solve mathematical problems in order to gain Bitcoin blocks on the chain as a reward.  "

Robbie compared the virtual money to Ken, Barbie’s enduring fictional character and well-known sidekick. Robbie stated that she overheard her husband, Tom Ackerley, and TV producer David Heyman discussing Bitcoin while they were on the set. Ken, Ryan Gosling’s fictitious co-star character in the film Barbie reminded her of these discussions. In Robbie’s opinion, the discussions on Bitcoin seemed to reflect Ken’s persona, leading her and her colleague Gretta to refer to them as “being such Kens.” Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, shared the video on X on Sunday and claimed that “Bitcoin is Big Ken Energy.” #Bitcoin  is Big Ken Energy. pic.twitter.com/ExFOGXsuJ9  — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) July 28, 2023   CCN reached out to Michael Saylor for commentary but did not receive a reply at the time of publishing. Ryan Gosling retreated when asked about the idea of “Ken Energy” in a Yahoo Entertainment interview. He instead looked to Robbie for help in defining the phrase. Meanwhile, Robbie explained the concept of “Ken Energy” and admitted how difficult it was to express. She clarified that it’s sort of a play on the abbreviation BDE, in which B is not for Bitcoin but it stands for “big d**k energy.” When Margot Robbie said you’re a Ken if talk #bitcoin  She meant you’re weak and pathetic. This was not a good thing 🤣 — Layah Heilpern (@LayahHeilpern) July 29, 2023   To understand the context of Robbie’s statement, one must be aware of the importance of Barbie and Ken in popular culture. Barbie, a doll made by Mattel, has stood for centuries as a symbol of style and elegance. Barbie frequently depicts Ken, her fictitious companion, as a helpful and fashionable partner. Lea Thompson, a crypto influencer best known by her Twitter handle Girl Gone Crypto and her 225,000 followers, declared that after hearing Robbie discuss Bitcoin, she is “so bullish.” Bitcoiners last week: yah haven't seen the Barbie movie, whatever, looks dumb  Bitcoiners today: MARGOT ROBBIE SAID THAT BITCOIN IS BIG KEN ENERGY, SO BULLISH — Girl Gone Crypto (@girlgone_crypto) July 29, 2023   Layah Heilpern, on the other hand, apparently took Robbie’s comments in a different light and saw it as an insult to guys who discuss Bitcoin. On July 30, Heilpern informed her 621,400 Twitter followers of Robbie’s suggested characterization of male Bitcoin aficionados as “weak and pathetic.” When Margot Robbie said you’re a Ken if talk #bitcoin  She meant you’re weak and pathetic. This was not a good thing 🤣 — Layah Heilpern (@LayahHeilpern) July 29, 2023   According to Mark Travers, chief psychologist at Awake Therapy, Ken’s energy could indicate someone who is selfless and versatile. Travers claimed that Ken breaks conventional gender norms in a Forbes article  on July 13. Travers said, “In a world where Barbie rules, Ken has only a supportive function to perform, and he plays it willingly. “Barbie is and comes before everything, we see male counterpart Ken relegated to the uni-dimensional and purely aesthetic role that women have often been confined to in the past, in a flippant and parody-like manner,” he said. Steven Lubka, managing director at Swan Bitcoin, saw Robbie’s remark as a plus for the Barbie and crypto Twitter community with excitement. On July 29, Lubka tweeted to his 20,200 followers, “We are so back.” Did we just get mainstream? — Yugocana (@yugocana) July 29, 2023   Robbie’s remarks on Bitcoin were succinct and un-instigating, coming amid continuous legal efforts against public figures who have recently endorsed cryptocurrency. Most recently, NBA Miami Heat star Jimmy Butler asked to be dropped from a $1 billion class-action lawsuit alleging cryptocurrency exchange Binance promoted unregistered securities. Butler’s attorneys said in a filing dated July 24 that the tweets that Butler was mentioned did not promote the cited securities and, as a result, could not have assisted in their promotion. Similar accusations are disputed in the same lawsuit by YouTube stars Ben Armstrong (BitBoy Crypto), Graham Stephan, and Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao."
2024-04-15 13:21:00+00:00,Coinbase CEO: The SEC Believes Every Coin Other Than BTC is a Security — Why is Bitcoin Different?,https://www.ccn.com/news/coinbase-ceo-sec-every-coin-other-than-btc-is-a-security/,"Before filing a lawsuit against the exchange, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requested that Coinbase cease trading in all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin as a statement of the agency’s intention to establish regulatory control over a wider market segment. After taking legal action against the Nasdaq-listed company last month for failing to register as a broker, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed  that the SEC made this proposal. The SEC claimed that 13 of the platform’s most infrequently traded cryptocurrencies on Coinbase were securities and that by making them available to users, the exchange came within the regulator’s authority. However, the preceding demand that Coinbase delist each and every one of the more than 200 tokens it provides, save for the flagship token Bitcoin, shows that the SEC, led by head Gary Gensler, has pushed for greater control over the cryptocurrency business. Armstrong remarked, “They came back to us, and they said… we feel every asset other than Bitcoin is a security. We then asked, ‘Well, how are you drawing that conclusion, since that’s not how we interpret the legislation?’ They advised that any assets other than Bitcoin be removed from the list because they would not be explaining it to them.” Unless they registered with the commission, most American cryptocurrency businesses would have been operating illegally if Coinbase had consented, setting a precedent that may have led to that outcome. “We really didn’t have a choice at that point, delisting every asset other than Bitcoin, which by the way is not what the law says, would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the US,” he said. “It kind of made it an easy choice . . . let’s go to court and find out what the court says,” he asserted. The SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have been vying for control of the cryptocurrency industry’s oversight, which has historically been a murky area. Three months before the SEC filed its own lawsuit against Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange, the CFTC filed one of its own in March of this year. Except for Bitcoin, Gensler has already stated that he thinks most cryptocurrencies are securities. However, the SEC has adopted this approach in its efforts to regulate the industry, as seen by the advice to Coinbase. The regulator’s case against the exchange did not include Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency and a key component of numerous industry projects. It was not among the 12 “crypto asset securities” listed in the SEC’s complaint against Binance. According to the SEC, its enforcement division didn’t formally ask “companies to delist crypto assets.” “The staff may share its own views as to what conduct may raise questions for the commission under the securities laws during an investigation,” it continued. The SEC oversees stocks, bonds, and other conventional financial instruments, but US policymakers are still divided on whether all crypto tokens or just some of them should fall under its jurisdiction. SEC oversight would result in much stricter compliance requirements. As well as lending and borrowing money from consumers, cryptocurrency exchanges frequently offer custody services—a combination of services that is not permitted for SEC-regulated businesses. According to Charley Cooper, a former CFTC chief of staff, “a lot of American companies have built their business models on the premise that these crypto tokens aren’t securities.” Many of them will have to discontinue procedures right once if they are advised otherwise. “It’s very difficult to see how there could be any public offerings or retail trading of tokens without some sort of intervention from Congress,” said Peter Fox, a partner at the law firm Scoolidge, Peters, Russotti & Fox. The SEC declined to comment on how a settlement involving Coinbase delisting all tokens other than Bitcoin may affect the rest of the industry. Since its creation, the CFTC has maintained that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether can be regulated as commodities under the CEA. The CTFC’s main argument is that a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is a commodity because each Bitcoin has the same worth as another Bitcoin of the same grade and can be exchanged for another Bitcoin on exchanges. The CFTC’s action against the stablecoin issuer Tether and the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex confirmed this opinion. In a filing from October 2021, the group asserted that “digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Tether” are all commodities. In April 2023, Rep. Patrick McHenry projected that in two months, the United States would have a cryptocurrency bill covering both securities and commodities issues and including both Bitcoin and Ether. He recently put out a measure that demands a clearer separation of duties between the SEC and the CFTC with regard to cryptocurrency-related matters. It would allow the trading of Bitcoin securities on alternative trading platforms and specifically permit registration, both of which would fall under the SEC’s purview. The SEC’s Gary Gensler has previously asserted that he thinks his agency can regulate cryptocurrencies and that “most crypto tokens are securities,” but he avoided answering the question of whether Ether was a security during a contentious hearing in April 2023. But in 2018, he said: “Bitcoin. Ether. Litecoin. Cash-based Bitcoin. Why did I choose those four names? They are not securities”."
2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,The Race to Bitcoin ETF: Here Are All the Dates to Watch Including BlackRock’s,https://www.ccn.com/news/race-bitcoin-etf-dates-to-watch/,"Blackrock, a well-known worldwide investment and management company, officially applied to the SEC in June of this year for permission to launch its own Bitcoin ETF, which the iShares Bitcoin Trust will administer. As it has done for years, the SEC rejected this first submission. BlackRock charged once more a month after renewing the application and taking SEC observations into account. However, it wasn’t only Blackrock that was interested (again) in setting up such a fund. Many other financial institutions, previously denied by the SEC multiple times, reiterated their applications. Key dates in the fight for approval include deadlines for the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock’s iShares coin Trust, Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF, Van Eck Bitcoin Trust, Wisdomtree BitcoinTrust, and many others, according to a tweet  from renowned ETF analyst James Seyffart. The second deadline for ARK 21Shares is set on August 13. This early deadline could provide ARK 21Shares with a competitive advantage. On September 1, Bitwise has its first deadline. The initial deadline of September 2 is shared by a sizable group of issuers, including the iShares Coin Trust by BlackRock and several others. These issuers might face a collective judgment day due to being grouped together, which might affect the SEC’s decision-making process. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund‘s first deadline is set for September 4. To potentially learn from the results of the earlier deadlines puts Valkyrie significantly behind the remainder of the field. Since it would offer a more accessible and regulated way to invest in cryptocurrencies without dealing with the complexities of crypto wallets and exchanges, investors have been clamoring for an ETF linked to Bitcoin. BlackRock, one of the biggest names on the list, filed last but is expected to receive a response on par with those of other applicants who did so far earlier. Seyffart explained  that although BlackRock’s prospectus filing dates might be later, all others had already been rejected by the SEC in the 19b-4 process once or even more than once, so their timing may not be as late as it seems. With this wave, BlackRock may be at the forefront of the ETF competition. A lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is one of the ways Grayscale’s GBTC, a well-known Bitcoin investment product, is striving for ETF designation. The judges’ judgment is anticipated within the next two months. If GBTC prevails in its legal battle with the SEC, some cryptocurrency aficionados think that it might become the first Bitcoin ETF. Seyffart has cautioned that Grayscale might not be allowed to convert to an ETF even if it wins its legal battle. A financial tool, also known as an exchange-traded fund, tracks the performance of a specific index, industry, commodity, or asset. Trading them on conventional stock exchanges enables investors to obtain exposure to these assets. These goods are widely available, particularly in the United States. The Security Exchange Commission and other regulators have been preventing a Bitcoin ETF for years, despite the existence of a thriving ETF industry. The coming months could see a change in this situation. A Bitcoin ETF was strongly desired in the cryptocurrency industry in 2018, but it was also one of the businesses pursuing its approval that failed the most. After prices reached their highest point ever in 2017 and entered a downturn phase in 2018, the narrative surrounding institutional participation gained popularity and an ETF’s requirement. Even after major corporations like Tesla or MicroStrategy entered the market, it never happened. In the opinion of Gabor Gurbacs, Advisor at VanEck and Tether, there are no good enough reasons for the SEC to reject the creation of a Bitcoin ETF. Gurbacs has first-hand knowledge of this because global investment firm VanEck has an active spot Bitcoin ETF application. “The SEC cited concerns about potential market manipulation, custody issues, and the overall maturity of the underlying market,” he said. The direct ownership of an underlying asset, such as Bitcoin, is represented by a spot Bitcoin ETF. When you purchase a share of a spot ETF, the fund buys an equivalent asset quantity, giving you almost a one-to-one exposure (fees excluded), explained Gurbacs. The acceptance of a local spot ETF in the US could affect the price of Bitcoin and how traditional investors view the asset, while also delivering a highly regulated investment product that allays any SEC worries. Gurbacs also asserted that by giving people and institutions a well-known and generally regulated way to get exposure to Bitcoin, the ETF  might increase the number of investors in the currency. It probably would increase liquidity and enhance price discovery. Second, it might promote institutional adoption, which might help stabilize the market and reduce price volatility. Although it’s impossible to predict when a spot Bitcoin ETF would bear, the situation is a little different than it was in 2018. For instance, El Salvador legalized Bitcoin in 2021, and a number of businesses are already stockpiling it or using it for treasury or investment management. This new trend includes BlackRock’s interest, and the acceptance of its application might completely alter the way people play the Bitcoin game. Before the cryptocurrency’s anticipated halving in April 2024, the price of Bitcoin may increase by 521% from present levels to $180,000, according to a Fundstrat report . Although the daily demand for Bitcoin is approximately $25 million, the daily mining incentives are also approximately $25 million, according to the financial research firm, this could alter with the prospective introduction of a Bitcoin ETF. According to the report, a Bitcoin ETF could increase daily demand for Bitcoin by an additional $100 million. The price of Bitcoin would need to climb significantly to reach an equilibrium between buyers and sellers given this increase and the April 2024 halving, which is scheduled to reduce daily mining earnings to $12 million."
2024-04-15 13:21:00+00:00,"Criminals No Longer Bitcoin-Believers, What is the Coin of Choice for Illicit Crypto Use?",https://www.ccn.com/news/criminals-not-using-bitcoin-what-is-coin-of-choice/,"
Key takeaways
 Bitcoin is no longer the cryptocurrency of choice for criminals, according to Web3 crime trends outlined in a presentation during EthCC in Paris. Tara Annison, former head of technical crypto advisory at Elliptic, delved into the world of crypto-related crime, highlighting shifting trends in the cryptocurrencies being used for money laundering and illicit activities. Unpacking insights from Web3 crime insights from Elliptic, Chainalysis and TRM Labs, Annison highlighted a shift away from criminals using BTC in illicit schemes to stablecoins and other cryptocurrency tokens. According to the speaker, criminals prefer using dollar-denominated assets, like USDC Coin (USDC), as they are easily accessible and can be laundered through decentralized exchanges (DEXs).  Ponzi schemes remain prevalent in the industry, with nearly $8 billion worth of funds stolen from unsuspecting users in 2022.  Criminals are also becoming increasingly more savvy using a variety of cryptocurrency cross-chain bridges, DEXs and mixing services in an effort to avoid blockchain analytics firms’ detection. A key takeaway from Annison’s presentation was the role that stablecoins are playing in the world of Web3 crimes.  The accessibility of stablecoins and their ubiquity across DEXs and centralized exchanges makes these assets an easy choice to quickly move funds around. Annison said digital assets  that are dollar-denominated feel “more accessible” which criminals use as a target point. “It’s also super easy to launder through DEXs. There’s deep liquidity, really good volume, so that’s pretty worrying.” The caveat of the increased use of stablecoins like USDC is the ability for issuers like Circle to freeze blacklisted tokens associated with hacks or thefts before criminals are able to cash out the stablecoins to fiat currencies. “What we’re seeing now is an increased number of accounts with USDC being blacklisted, and these are frozen funds that the criminals now can’t access.” Ponzi schemes have been part and parcel of the cryptocurrency space dating back to the early years after Bitcoin’s inception. As Annison highlighted, scams are still prevalent and continually account for major losses. “It might feel a bit 80s, but they reign supreme. In 2022 we saw $7.8 billion worth of funds stolen from users in the space from ponzis and pyramids. The ten largest of these schemes accounted for about 54%. Ponzis and pyramids tend to get really big and dominate.” Annison highlighted Forsage and Trade Coin Club, the latter of which was eventually charged by the SEC . Trade Coin Club raised more than 82,000 BTC from 100,000 investors globally over a two year period. The SEC also charged eleven individuals responsible for running Forsage  for operating an illegal pyramid scheme that raised over $300 million from users. The presentation also suggested that criminals are becoming more sophisticated in laundering stolen funds by using chain swapping and asset swapping techniques, aiming to evade blockchain analytics firms’ detection. “Criminals employ chain swapping and asset hoping to throw off blockchain analytics firms and evade detection, making it harder to trace stolen funds.” Annison also highlighted an interesting correlation between the number of scams in the industry and prevailing cryptocurrency market conditions. Scams in the cryptocurrency space have decreased due to the falling market prices, as fewer new investors are attracted, making it less profitable for criminals. Annison also touched on sanctions evasion and terrorist financing, suggesting that terrorists are increasingly using crypto to bypass international financial barriers “Cryptocurrencies are being used for sanctions evasion and terrorist financing, with Tron and USDtt being favored by terrorist organizations.” Annison also noted that some sanctioned nations have turned to Bitcoin mining in an effort to bypass sanctions. She highlighted reports and data from 2021 that estimated that 4.5% of all Bitcoin mining was carried out in Iran, with the proceeds used to evade sanctions. The popularity of various metaverse platforms has also led to an element of criminality creeping in.  Phishing attacks, NFT theft, wallet tainting, and augmented reality hacks have all become commonplace, according to Annison, presenting unique challenges for the sector to tackle with users’ reputations and security at risk. Overall, the cryptocurrency sector continues to face a range of criminal activities, demanding increased vigilance and security measures to protect users and combat illicit activities."
2024-04-15 13:21:00+00:00,Bitcoin Flexes Muscle Through Q2 While Altcoins ‘Bleed’: Is Altcoin Season Coming After SEC Decision?,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-flexes-q2-altcoins-bleed-altcoin-season-coming/,"A quarterly report from cryptocurrency data aggregator CoinGecko highlights Bitcoin and Ethereum dominance as investors shifted away from altcoins in Q2. The two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization both came through Q2 seeing a quarter-on-quarter price gain while a number of altcoins saw significant losses.   While cryptocurrency markets only saw a market cap increase of 0.14% from Q1 to Q2, Bitcoin managed to see an average value increase of 6.9% and ETH increased by 6.0% in Q2. This means that both BTC and ETH outperformed the total cryptocurrency market cap by a percentage increase.  Trading volumes also decreased drastically through the second quarter of 2023, with average daily trading volumes down 58% from $33 billion in Q1 to $13.8 billion in Q2.  As per the report, Binance’s decision to remove zero-fee trading incentives for Bitcoin in March had a marked effect on trading volumes which continued from there.  CoinGecko also notes a major sell-off of altcoins in comparison to BTC and ETH. Binance Coin (BNB), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA) saw drops of 24%, 12%, and 28% in value as they faced respective scrutiny in the United States. ADA and BNB were directly listed in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SECs) lawsuits against Binance.US and Coinbase as unregistered securities.  The stablecoin market was not saved from losses in Q2 but Coingecko’s data suggests that the sector only lost 3.5% value quarter-on-quarter.  A mini-banking crisis in the U.S. and the SEC once again played a role here, as USD Coin (USDC) and Binance USD (BUSD) emerged as the biggest stablecoin losses. USDC was directly impacted  by the bankruptcy of Silicon Valley Bank, which held some $3.3 billion of reserves of the stablecoin. The resulting fall-out saw a large amount of USDC sold across the markets, losing $5.1 billion in Q2. Binance’s stablecoin was affected by Paxos’ being instructed to stop issuing the exchange’s dollar-back token, with $3.4 billion of BUSD removed from circulation as a result. Tether (USDT) saw a 4% gain in market cap, totaling $83 billion at the end of Q2. Coingecko also highlights the surge in interest and gains made by a variety of memecoins in May 2023. $PEPE led the way with mind-shattering 1813x returns at its peak trading, accumulating $1.8 billion in market capitalization after Binance listed the token.  The inception of BRC-20 tokens, which allow for the minting of NFTs on Bitcoin’s blockchain, saw Bitcoin Ordinals $ORDI attract $600 million in market cap.  Despite the influence of memecoins and BRC-20 tokens, the NFT space saw a drop-off in trading volumes from $4.84 billion in Q1 to $3.15 billion in Q2. While altcoins endured an overall drop in market capitalization in Q2, a ruling partly in favor of XRP in its ongoing case against the SEC could signal renewed hope for altcoins in general. The SEC originally sued  Ripple Labs and executives Brad Garlinghouse and Christian Larsen for allegedly raising $1.3 billion through an unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering. The latest development in the five-year-long legal dispute saw Southern District of New York judge Analisa Torres rule that XRP was not considered a security when sold programmatically on cryptocurrency exchanges. The SEC was somewhat vindicated, as Torres also ruled that XRP met the conditions of security set in the Howey Test when it was sold to institutional investors. The likes of major cryptocurrencies Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), and ADA were listed in SEC lawsuits against both Binance.US and Coinbase, but Torres’ ruling could mean there’s a legal precedent that will absolve tokens that have come under regulatory scrutiny.  CFTC commissioner Caroline Pham suggests that regulatory clarity over the sector would require different agencies to work together.   "

Key Takeaways
 Tesla, the world’s leading EV manufacturer, just released the company’s earnings report  for the second quarter of 2023. Within the report, the company details its expenditures and income from various sources, including returns on investments. However, the report shows that the company has made no sales of digital assets — not for this quarter, nor the two quarters prior. Tesla reports that it holds $184 million in digital assets, a figure that hasn’t changed since Q3 of 2022.  Considering the huge push both Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk made for crypto in 2021, the company’s inactivity in the crypto market tells a story about its change of attitude towards digital asset investment. If we rewind the clock all the way to 2021, we’ll remember how Tesla shocked the crypto market when it invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. According to the US Securities and Exchange filing , the company said that it “invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in Bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future.” The move shocked the market as Bitcoin immediately rose in price by over $3,000. Shortly after, Musk tweeted that the company “has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,” adding that “Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.” Tesla & Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/YSswJmVZhP  — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 12, 2021   Fast forward just over a year, in Q2 2022, the company sold 75% of its Bitcoin stash for $936 million, realizing a profit of $128 million.  The company then released its earning report reflecting the sale, stating, “As of the end of Q2, we have converted approximately 75% of our Bitcoin purchases into fiat currency.” “Conversions in Q2 added $936M of cash to our balance sheet.” The company also commented on the huge Bitcoin offload, saying it was meant to “prove liquidity of Bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet.” Through quick maths, we can assume that Tesla sold its Bitcoin stash for an average of $29,000 per token. The figure is shockingly close to the price of BTC at the time this article is being written, floating around $30,000. So, had Tesla held onto its Bitcoin stash for a year longer, the company would’ve sold the same tokens in 2023 for $968 million, rather than $936 million. In the meantime, Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk has been fickle about his support for DogeCoin. As the company was making its huge purchase of Bitcoin, Musk posted a series of tweets to show support for DogeCoin, even momentarily including “Dogecoin” in his Twitter bio.  Doge — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2021   Dogecoin is the people’s crypto — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2021   No highs, no lows, only Doge — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2021   As a result, DogeCoin saw a staggering 50% surge  in price. Elon even gave another 30% boost  to DogeCoin earlier this year when Twitter decided to change its logo from the typical blue bird to the DogeCoin logo. Tesla still accepts DogeCoin as a form of payment on its websites. A whole FAQ page on Tesla’s website is dedicated to DogeCoin. Perhaps, as a result, Evan Spencer of Evan Spencer Law, A New York plaintiffs’ lawyer, filed accusations against Tesla and its CEO, claiming market manipulation.  The complaint  states that Musk and Tesla used eight crypto wallets to sell DogeCoin after hyping up the token through Twitter shenanigans. Musk has responded with proof that he had disclaimed these wallets prior to the DogeCoin sale."
2024-04-19 13:24:00+00:00,Bitcoin Bull Run Might Mean a Better Payday for Celsius Creditors,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-bull-run-better-for-celsius-creditors/,"
Key Takeaways
 Ever since the collapse of Celsius, a failed crypto lender, which led to the suspension of $4.7 billion in client funds, the company’s customers have been scrambling to get their money back, or at least a bit of it. At first, the company was ordered by the court to repay 72.5% of what it owes Custody clients, i.e. clients who just deposited their crypto with Celsius for safekeeping. Then, as part of the company’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy application, the company was ordered to partially refund Earn customers, who represent a majority of Celsius’ creditors.  As part of the company’s refund plan, Celsius aims to repay its Earn clients in part Bitcoin and Ethereum, part NewCo shares, and part litigation fees. Simon Dixon, founder of Bnk To The Future, now claims the failed crypto lender may have enough liquidity to pay all creditors in full if Bitcoin and Ethereum manage to surge in value. Dixon tweeted  a financial breakdown of the liquidity needed to pay back Celsius customers in full. Focusing on the company’s new acquirer, Fahrenheit, Bnk To The Future’s founder estimated the values Bitcoin and Ethereum would need to reach for Fahrenheit to completely refund Celsius’ customers.  I was asked in my Space what price of #Bitcoin  & $ETH  would allow #Celsius  & the bankruptcy code to rug pull us by using #BTC  & $ETH  price appreciation to pay off our $USD  claims & keep all other assets. The Investment Banking team at @BankToTheFuture  gave me the numbers today… pic.twitter.com/EW8fuBVhLG  — Simon Dixon (@SimonDixonTwitt) July 19, 2023   Dixon first focused on the biggest gains acquired by Fahrenheit as it takes over Celsius, mainly mining operations. “NewCo under @FahrenheitHldg includes Mining, Institutional Loans & Investments & is valued at approximately $1.4 billion. This includes $450 million in liquid crypto.Net equity value, therefore, is $950 million.” Analysis of Assets.  Key difference between the 2 options are: – NewCo under @FahrenheitHldg  includes Mining, Institutional Loans & Investments & is valued at approximately $1.4 billion.  This includes $450 million liquid crypto.  Net equity value therefore is $950 million.… pic.twitter.com/srDjsbWJOF  — Simon Dixon (@SimonDixonTwitt) July 19, 2023   The crypto analyst then provided a breakdown of the crypto values required to reach the liquidity that would enable Celsius to pay back its customers in full. Among the most notable numbers is a potential future value of Bitcoin at $54,879, which is almost double its value at the time of writing of this article of ~$30,000. Dixon also based his argument on an ETH value that would need to reach $3,750, as opposed to the current value of ~$1,900. Analysis of Assets.  Key difference between the 2 options are: – NewCo under @FahrenheitHldg  includes Mining, Institutional Loans & Investments & is valued at approximately $1.4 billion.  This includes $450 million liquid crypto.  Net equity value therefore is $950 million.… pic.twitter.com/srDjsbWJOF  — Simon Dixon (@SimonDixonTwitt) July 19, 2023   Besides the disappointing percentages of owed refunds the company decided on its distribution plan, the act of filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy doesn’t seem to sufficiently punish Celsius directors nor discourage crypto entrepreneurs from creating a similar collapse. Granted Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky may face jail time – which Celsius reported would not affect the proceedings of the company’s Chapter 11 distribution plan – other directors are walking away from the turmoil scot-free. On top of that, as part of Fahrenheit’s acquisition plan, the company planned on creating NewCo, mainly managed by Celsius directors who were part of the collapse to begin with. Finally, the Bankruptcy’s initial decision to only force Celsius to partially refund a small portion of their customers (after losing a total of $4.7 billion) sets a bad precedent that may encourage future like-minded entrepreneurs to gamble with customer funds, seeing that the punishment doesn’t seem too bad considering the magnitude of the collapse. "

Key Takeaways
 Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a Democratic presidential candidate is doing the rounds for his campaign. Among his main talking points is his strong support for Bitcoin as a legible form of payment within the US. Besides being a Bitcoin holder, Kennedy Jr. sees the cryptocurrency’s potential as a way to stabilize the value of the US dollar and counteract the rampant inflation occurring in the nation.  During the Heal-the-Divide PAC event on July 19th, Kennedy Jr. discussed the potential for Bitcoin, alongside gold and silver, as backing for the US dollar, claiming it’s a ‘hard currency’. “The Kennedy administration will begin to back the US dollar with real finite assets, such as gold, silver, platinum, and Bitcoin, which is the world’s hardest liquid asset, to strengthen the US dollar and guarantee its success as a world reserve currency,” said  Kennedy Jr. during his Heal-the-Divide PAC virtual event. The Democrat presidential candidate is an avid supporter of cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin, as a viable payment and investment option in the US. RFK has reportedly invested over $250,000  in Bitcoin, which is a sign that he personally supports the crypto token movement, not just a presidential campaign gimmick. However, RFK’s speech floated more than just the idea of stabilizing the value of the US dollar using Bitcoin and precious metals.  “Backing dollars and U.S. debt obligations with hard assets could help restore strength back to the dollar, rein in inflation, and usher in a new era of American financial stability, peace and prosperity.” Kennedy Jr. also talked about the idea of removing taxes when converting Bitcoin to fiat USD. The idea is to remove the financial barrier for individual investors to invest in Bitcoin and altcoins by creating a seamless financial environment without overcharging fees. On top of that, RFK is a strong supporter of creating individual crypto wallets and home-based crypto nodes that would provide Americans with freedom over their finances, eliminating the threat of governments “controlling freedom of speech using the threat of inflation”. As president, I will make sure that your right to use and hold Bitcoin is inviolable. Bitcoin is not only a bulwark against totalitarianism and the manipulation of our money supply, it points the way toward a future in which government institutions are more transparent and more… pic.twitter.com/rPkMARieYu  — Robert F. Kennedy Jr (@RobertKennedyJr) June 27, 2023   The US Dollar was removed from the gold standard back in 1971 by President Nixon as part of an economic movement now known as the Nixon Shock. Ever since, the US never fully returned to a fixed exchange rate system or a strict gold standard. The US dollar has since been a fiat currency, meaning that its value is based on trade activities and international demand.  However, it’s important to note that there have been some subsequent efforts to reintroduce aspects of the gold standard or alternative systems with ties to gold, including the Smithsonian Agreement in 1971, and the Jamaica Agreement in 1976.  However, all attempts made by various politicians, economists, and advocates have failed to return the fiat currency to a fixed gold standard. It’s rather unorthodox to include Bitcoin in a list of ‘hard currencies’ that include gold and platinum as financial instruments to support the US dollar’s value. The main reason behind that is that the inflation-adjusted return  of gold annually has been about 3.3%, and the total return has been about 57%. At the same time, Bitcoin has an inflation-adjusted annualized return of nearly 145% and a total return of 33,983,965%. Gold and other precious metals may seem like an outdated form of currency valuation, but it holds the advantage of longevity. The value of precious metals does fluctuate, but often by minute percentages, simply because it has been tried and tested for countless years.  Bitcoin and altcoins, on the other hand, are relatively infant value deposits. Hence, these tokens tend to fluctuate in value in far larger margins. Granted Bitcoin’s future does look to be more secure since the involvement of major financial institutions, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, who promise to “democratize crypto”, perhaps leading to a potentially more stable financial future. "

Key Takeaways
 The crypto world has been rocked by two major announcements over the last few days. First, Ripple managed to partially win its case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) following Judge Analisa Torres’ decision that XRP should not be considered a security, so long as it was being sold on crypto exchanges rather than directly to investors.  The second notable headline was regarding the SEC adding BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund (ETF) application to its official docket as part of its proposed rule change process. Should the application get the SEC’s approval, BlackRock will be the first to initiate its spot ETF, opening the door for more applications to be approved in the future. Digital asset management company Grayscale is in litigation against the SEC as the regulating body refuses to allow Grayscale to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to a spot ETF. We’ve filed a lawsuit against the SEC. $GBTC  — Sonnenshein (@Sonnenshein) June 30, 2022   The news about Ripple helped trigger a surge in GBTC activity. Grayscale filed its lawsuit  against the SEC on June 30th. The digital asset manager sued the regulating body for rejecting its request to convert its GBTC to a spot ETF, while approving leveraged ETFs.  The filing said: “The fact that the Commission has allowed a leveraged bitcoin futures ETP to begin trading demonstrates that the Commission continues to arbitrarily treat spot bitcoin ETPs differently than bitcoin futures ETPs.” It continued: “While the Commission could theoretically correct its discriminatory treatment of spot bitcoin ETPs by rescinding its approval of all bitcoin-based ETPs, the Commission’s apparent willingness to permit even a leveraged bitcoin futures ETP—a particularly high-risk version of a bitcoin futures product—makes clear that theCommission has no intention of doing so. Thus, the only way to eliminate the Commission’s unequal treatment of bitcoin-based ETPs is to allow proposed spot bitcoin ETPs like Grayscale’s to begin trading.” James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, even cast his prediction regarding the lawsuit’s timeline. Gonna retweet this because Grayscale has already filed their APA lawsuit for the $GBTC  denial. Here is our *estimated* timeline of events courtesy of @NYCStein . But things are moving fast. https://t.co/ql8a43W5vs  — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 30, 2022   In the meantime, financial institutions, including the world’s biggest asset management firm, BlackRock, have been continuously applying for spot ETFs. BlackRock’s application has finally been added  to the SEC’s official docket for review. While that doesn’t necessarily mean that BlackRock’s application is about to be accepted, it points towards a positive future for spot ETF applications. In light of the news, Grayscale’s GBTC daily volumes see a spike that signals its highest level in 2023.  Statistics  show that Grayscale’s largest fund product topped $183 million on July 13. The company’s second best score was on June 30th, when it topped $170.  Whether the asset manager will finally have their wish of attaining a spot ETF is yet to be seen. However, the SEC is currently under heavy scrutiny by both legislators and private companies.  "

Key Takeaways

 Normalizing inflation rates have been a boon to technology and cryptocurrency markets through 2023, according to the latest market outlook from Grayscale. The cryptocurrency investment firm unpacked  the influence of the latest consumer price index (CPI) data for June 2023 released  in the United States on July 12, with CPI-measured inflation tipped at 3%. Meanwhile Grayscale highlighted core inflation at 4.9% year-over-year, which cuts out volatile food and energy prices, as a better gauge of underlying price trends. This is the lowest core inflation rate since October 2021. The data reflects a trend of renewed interest in the risk asset market according to Grayscale, highlighting year-to-date price returns on Bitcoin and top tech stocks: “We believe moderating inflation this year has reduced investor concerns about over-tightening by the Federal Reserve and has fueled a tech and crypto-centric rally in risk asset markets.” Grayscale’s report notes that moderation inflation could reduce the likelihood of the Federal Reserve continuing its efforts to tighten interest rates. This could in turn extend “gains in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Data reflects Bitcoin showing a positive correlation with risk assets and a negative correlation with the Federal Reserve’s policy changes.  “These patterns reflect Bitcoin’s dual role as an emergent technology and an alternative to the US Dollar as a money system or currency. Improving investor risk appetite and lower real interest rates tends to weigh on the Dollar and support Bitcoin and crypto more broadly.” Grayscale’s report also suggests that Bitcoin might not be the only cryptocurrency set to gain from loosening inflation pressures in the United States.  The analysts suggest that this has led to lower investor demand for inflation-hedging instruments like BTC and a larger appetite for higher-risk tokens, seeing Bitcoin market capitalization dominance falling. Grayscale notes Solana as a “star performer”, returning gains of 125% in 2023 and 46% through May.  “Solana is showing signs of steady recovery from setbacks such as the liquidation of user holdings by FTX and Robinhood, among other factors.  The report concludes that lower U.S. inflation and lower chances of Federal Reserve rate hikes could support cryptocurrency markets over the medium term. Bitcoin has seen renewed interest over the past two months following news of renewed efforts to launch Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. The world’s largest asset manager BlackRock as well as Fidelity have grabbed headlines for their latest applications for Bitcoin ETFs. The likes of Anthony Pompliano have also suggested that Bitcoin has been sitting in undervalued territory for over a year and increased interest from Wall Street players indicates a “strong tailwind scenario” for the asset."

Key Takeaways

 An investor’s note from private wealth management firm Bernstein has unpacked a potential scenario that would force MicroStrategy to sell some of its Bitcoin holdings. The business intelligence firm has been converting most of its corporate treasury to Bitcoin (BTC) in a move led by CEO Michael Saylor over the past two years. The company holds over 150,000 BTC, valued at $4.5 billion, of which some tokens have been used as collateral for loans. According to Bernstein’s note, which has grabbed headlines, MicroStrategy plans to continue raising debt into the future, which could lead to a potential scenario where it would have to liquidate its BTC holdings. This would require “extreme price corrections” coinciding with the company’s debt expiry in 2025. The worst-case scenario would see the value of MicroStrategy’s BTC holdings fall below its debt obligations. This would lead to its corporate structure coming under pressure from ‘spring forward’ clauses.  “2028 due debt does have liquidity covenants which could spring forward the debt to 2025/26”, the report added. MicroStrategy is somewhat of a trailblazer for the institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Saylor initiated the firm’s BTC acquisition strategy after announcing the company would convert its treasury to Bitcoin in 2020. The company would go on a spree of Bitcoin investing, starting with a $250 million buy order for 21,454 BTC in August 2020. The company now holds over 152,000 BTC as of July 2023, valued at $4.5 billion at an average price of $29,600. MicroStrategy also announced  a $1.05 billion loan in February 2021 that matures in 2027 that it used to continue its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. This is part of the debt the company is carrying that could lead to a potential sell-off scenario which Bernstein has highlighted. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings are significant for a single entity and exceed the 142,000 BTC owed to creditors of the infamous, defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox. As CCN previously explored, there has been similar speculation about the potential impact of the return of the 142,000 BTC to former Mt. Gox’s users and whether that amount of liquidity would drive Bitcoin’s value down. Quantum Economics founder and seasoned cryptocurrency market analyst Mati Greenspan said that the value of Mt. Gox’s BTC is not even as significant as daily trading volumes:  “Daily on-chain volumes are at an average of $12 billion, and exchange volumes are reportedly in the neighborhood of $18 billion per day. So this is certainly something the market can absorb in a relatively short time frame.” While the comments were aimed at Mt. Gox creditors BTC holdings, the fairly similar value provides a good measuring of what would transpire if MicroStrategy were to sell some BTC."

Key Takeaways
 Crypto, specifically Bitcoin, has been around since its inception in 2009. People have traded back and forth using the token, whether to buy pizza or services over the internet. For the longest time, regulating bodies didn’t take the technology and its potential seriously. Governments started to take Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seriously when users started utilizing them for purposes that were deemed unfavorable. Whether it was cases in which crypto was used to purchase illegal substances or others in which financial entities would evade taxes. Things, however, took a serious turn when crypto-run businesses started causing damage to the financial wellbeing of citizens and governments alike. The FTX collapse really caught the attention of regulators at a whole new scale, simply because it caused billions of dollars in losses. Ever since, regulators have been extra strict on the industry, going on the offensive against any private organization that may pose the threat of creating an FTX-like situation. While Terra’s and Celsius‘s collapses did occur, causing even more billions of dollars in damage, regulating bodies have stayed vigilant and somewhat aggressive against crypto. Now, crypto, most specifically Bitcoin, is witnessing a phoenix-like revival due to corporate interest. The involvement of major financial corporations such as BlackRock, ARK, and Fidelity in crypto brings the promise of governmental and private regulation of the market.  As a result, Bitcoin now has a better chance to receive a green light to grow and increase in utility as a payment option. So, as the trend goes, Bitcoin is looking optimistic in both value and regulation.  Way before BlackRock, Fidelity, and co, Grayscale Investments had the crypto market to itself. Establishing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the company manages $19.1 billion in assets. Interestingly, Grayscale filed to convert GBTC to an ETF in partnership with the New York Stock Exchange. However, after stalling for a long time, the SEC rejected Grayscale’s application last June, citing that the proposal lacked sufficient anti-fraud guarantees.  The SEC’s decision was questioned not only by Grayscale but also by other governmental entities . Following the news, Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC on the matter, yet no solid decision was taken thus far.  During an interview with CNBC, Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein celebrated the emergence of financial institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity in the crypto space.  “To see literally the largest asset manager in the world publicly commit to advancing their crypto efforts only lends validity to the asset class and the staying power that it has,” said Sonnenshein. The Grayscale CEO is perhaps more optimistic about his company’s ETF application now that BlackRock and co seem to be on their way to getting SEC’s approval. “If we’re successful in that challenge there’s actually billions of dollars in investor capital that would be unlocked through that.” It’s fair to start looking at Bitcoin optimistically as an option for investment, as signs are showing toward a more stable future for the token. It’s equally fair to assume that Bitcoin will likely increase in value in the future following Wall Street’s involvement in the market.  It is somewhat fair to also assume that Bitcoin will fall under a lot more restrictions as such corporations will continue to build their own fortifications to avoid potential collapses on their investments. With that in mind, the token that was once celebrated for being so decentralized people used it to buy pizzas online, is likely to be regulated by the same powers that controlled the traditional financial world that led people toward decentralized tokens in the first place. On top of that, regulating bodies are likely to add more regulatory constraints to tokens such as Bitcoin, effectively treating it as any other TradFi investment."

Key Takeaways
 In just three months’ time, $4.3 billion worth of Bitcoin is set to be paid out to creditors of the defunct, infamous Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange.  The trustee in charge of recouping funds from the exchange closed final creditor registration in preparation for the reimbursement of user BTC holdings in April 2023. A statement  from attorney Nobuaki Kobayashi tipped October 31 for the processing of some payments to creditors. Some 20,000 creditors are looking to receive funds that were lost in the collapse of Mt. Gox, which became the most infamous cryptocurrency exchange failure between 2010 and 2020 before the likes of FTX imploded. Total current balance on all known addresses* of the MtGox Trustee: 135890.98002134 BTC.  -0.00043187 BTC have been moved away from these addresses since 2018/05/10. $BTC  #bitcoin  #mtgox  mt.gox mt gox 2023-07-11T09:19:03.239Z UTC — MtGoxBalanceBot (@MtGoxBalanceBot) July 11, 2023   While an official number is yet to be confirmed by Mt. Gox , an estimated 142,000 BTC are held by the trust, valued at around $4.3 billion as of July 2023. Twitter bot MtGoxBalanceBot tips the known addresses of the Mt. Gox trustee to hold 135,890 BTC. Given the substantial amount of Bitcoin set to be repaid to creditors, as well as the significant appreciation in the value of the holdings of Mt. Gox users since the exchange went defunct, a potential offloading of recouped BTC onto various exchanges is touted to influence the price of Bitcoin later this year. The biggest talking point ahead of the looming Mt. Gox creditor payout is the potential price impact the event will have on Bitcoin across the world. As initially reported  by Cointelegraph, some analysts believe that the repayment program might not be as influential as it is being made out to be. Quantum Economics founder and seasoned cryptocurrency market analyst Mati Greenspan said that the amount of BTC that is set to be returned simply pales in comparison to present-day trading activity. “Some will HODL. Some will sell. Ultimately, it doesn’t really matter since the total Mt. Gox repayment is marginally less than BTC’s daily trading volume,” Greenspan wrote on Twitter. Some will HODL. Some will sell.  Ultimately, it doesn't really matter since the total Mt. Gox repayment is marginally less than BTC's daily trading volume.

Gox repayment date, the potential for a sizable portion of BTC being sold off on markets might have a compounding negative effect on the price of Bitcoin.  EXPECT A 30% Bitcoin & 50% Altcoin DUMP IF THIS PLAYS OUT! https://t.co/R0UPOqNsaw  — Crypto Banter (@crypto_banter) July 10, 2023   A report published  by Blockchain Research Lab (BRL) in August 2022 highlights that a total of 22,560 individual creditors were recognized by the Mt. Gox trustee. 20,658 of the creditors have made claims in BTC while 11,868 made fiat currency claims. The report tipped the claims to be valued at $18.6 billion in BTC and Bitcoin Cash as well as $48 million in US dollars. Interestingly, Mt. Gox founder Mark Karpeles indicated that the exchange had 1.1 million active accounts in 2013, meaning that only 2.1% of all active accounts filed and received claims. BRL suggests that many accounts might not have had substantial holdings at the time of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy filing as a possible reason for this low percentage. The report also noted that the average claim for Mt. Gox Bitcoin creditors is ~39 BTC, which is valued at $1.1 million as of July 2023. Creditors can expect to receive double that amount, given that they’ll receive an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) tokens following the hard fork of the latter blockchain from the Bitcoin core network."
2024-04-15 13:21:00+00:00,Bitcoin NFTs Taking Over: Ordinals Inscriptions Approach All-Time High with Low Fees,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-ordinals-news/,"
Key Takeaways
 Ordinals, NFTs on the BTC blockchain made the headlines last week as it adopted a new protocol named BRC-69. The protocol utilizes a method called Recursive Inscription which allows users to make the most of the space provided on each block. Ordinals are now back in the headlines for their staggering success. Crypto analytics firms are reporting a huge increase in transaction rates on the BTC blockchain while maintaining transaction fees.  With such mass technology adoption, is it possible to achieve the dream predicted by BRC-69 creators? According to Dune , Ordinals saw 385,920 inscriptions over the weekend, making it the second-busiest day ever for Ordinals. The busiest day for the NFTs was May 7th, which saw around 400,000 inscriptions. The huge surge of activity on the blockchain is likely due to the introduction of BRC-69, a technology that allows users to bypass the 4-megabyte limit on each block. More importantly, the Dune dashboard  recorded the average transaction fee to be around 2.5 BTC, which is a huge discount from previous inscription fees.  Every block allows 4 megabytes of data to be stored. With the BTC blockchain gaining more users, blocks are becoming more scarce, and transaction fees are increasing over time. The idea behind BRC-69 lies with recursive inscription. Recursive Inscription uses coding lines that allow blocks to retrieve information from other blocks. So, users may now use most of their block to store new information and utilize a fraction of the storage memory to insert an inscription that recalls data from another block, effectively giving it access to eight megabytes of data instead.  The technology doesn’t just allow the recollection of data from a single block but from whatever number of blocks utilize recursive inscription. So, if 300,000 blocks use Ordinals BRC-69, a user may use recursive inscription to retrieve data from all of them, accessing Gigabytes of data through a mere 4-megabyte block. WTF are recursive inscriptions? Here is everything you need to know: Earlier this year the Ordinals Protocol introduced the ability for anyone to inscribe files fully on-chain onto Bitcoin. These inscriptions are self-contained and unaware of the other files that had been… pic.twitter.com/O3jt6lhaxT  — Leonidas (@LeonidasNFT) June 12, 2023   “We can think even bigger, though. What if lots of people upload lots of packages of code? So now there is a huge repository of packages for developers to build on top of. This would unlock powerful use cases that could never be done in under 4 MB. The most complex pieces of software are just a bunch of code compiled together, after all.  Now it becomes possible to put a complex 3D video game on-chain on Bitcoin fully. The sky is the limit. Bitcoin is essentially getting an internal internet where every file can request data from the other files on Bitcoin,” – reads the tweet above.  Essentially the technology creator dreams of a Bitcoin-based network of information that would use recursive inscriptions to allow the creation of huge programs based on a single block. With increased interest in Ordinals, BRC-69 is increasing the likelihood of such a future. ORDI and OXBT, have partnered with Emblem to bring BRC-20 tokens to the Ethereum blockchain. While it is yet to provide a bridge for recursive inscription, it definitely increases the potential for such a future. ⬛️🟧 $ORDI  and $OXBT  MEGATHREAD 🟧⬛️ 🚀 VAULTING IS NOW LIVE 🚀 🔸 How to Mint🔸 Where to Trade 🔸 Vaulting Mechanics🔸 Details, Info, Integrations, and Partnerships pic.twitter.com/AANoZjTVxs  — Emblem Vault (@EmblemVault) July 6, 2023  "

Michael Saylor’s Gamble Ready to Pay Off,https://www.ccn.com/news/microstrategy-good-bet-bitcoin-halving-michael-saylor-gamble/,"The imminent Bitcoin halving is expected to provide equities with a focus on Bitcoin’s new momentum, including Michael Saylor’s tech company MicroStrategy. Berenberg Capital Markets, a New York-based investment company with a $430 price objective for MicroStrategy (MSTR), outlined its rationale for having a strong outlook in its research report. The analysts assert that MicroStrategy derives most of its worth from the 152,333 Bitcoin it has on hand as of June 28 and add that a rally for the Bitcoin halving could result in a big price increase for its shares. “[It] is our expectation that the price of Bitcoin will repeat its historical pattern of rallying both ahead of and following each Bitcoin halving.” Last Bitcoin ETF decision deadline: 3/19/24 Bitcoin halving estimate: 4/16/24 👀👀 pic.twitter.com/8zxcp8TQsh  — Will Clemente (@WClementeIII) July 10, 2023   “If the historical pattern established by the first three bitcoin halvings continues to play out with the fourth halving, then the pre-halving rally would begin about four months from now,” the report says The 50% reduction in BTC issuance rate due to the April 26, 2024, Bitcoin halving would drastically slow the rate at which new Bitcoin enters the cryptocurrency market. As Berenberg points out, the price of Bitcoin has increased by at least 682% over previous rounds of halving. The price of Bitcoin circled at $12 on November 28, 2012, when the first halving occurred. Its price reached its peak at $1,164 367 days later. While Bitcoin’s supply follows a “predetermined path,” the researchers pointed out that the entire demand for Bitcoin needed to be assessed before anybody could estimate the “potential magnitude” of a future rise. As evidence that institutional adoption of Bitcoin is increasing, the report used the recent jump in spot Bitcoin ETF applications from some of the world’s “largest and highest-profile” asset managers. According to TradingView statistics, MicroStrategy shares are currently trading for $407.17, having increased by roughly 180% since the start of 2023. In the meantime, the cost of Bitcoin has risen by 84% since the year’s beginning. A few weeks ago, Bitcoin’s dominance was set to reach 80% in the long term as regulators crack down on other assets; MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor then confirmed  that MicroStrategy is the largest public holder of BTC. Saylor explained that since 2020, Bitcoin has been the sole institutional-grade investable asset in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, according to MicroStrategy’s view. According to him, Bitcoin is a digital commodity that is accepted universally and internationally. Saylor thinks that stablecoins, crypto securities, and crypto derivatives do not have a “legitimate path forward” in the eyes of authorities. In its actions against Binance and Coinbase, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declared 19 cryptocurrency assets as securities last month. The company’s investment had an entry value of $3.975 billion. The company holds approximately 152,333 BTC .  Saylor is optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term potential and sure that the investment would be profitable. Marathon is a cryptocurrency mining corporation with a market cap of $225 million as of today and 12,538 Bitcoins  with an entry value of $150 million. The shares jumped 81.35% in the last month. Coinbase, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, is no stranger to the Bitcoin community. With an entrance value of $173.7 million and a current worth of $201.6 million, the corporation currently has approximately 9,000 BTC. In the last month, the shares of the crypto exchange jumped over 60%. With an entrance value of $220 million and a current worth of $179.8 million, the financial services and mobile payment company currently possesses 8,027 BTC . Similar to Coinbase, Square has made a modest investment in Bitcoin compared to other companies on this list, but it is obvious that Square believes the cryptocurrency market has potential. The jump within the last 30 days was around 7%. Another cryptocurrency mining business that has diversified its holdings by purchasing Bitcoin is Hut 8. Approximately 9,136 BTC  is held by the corporation. The shares of this company skyrocketed within the last 30 days by more than 95%. A cryptocurrency mining business called Hive Blockchain has operations in Sweden and Canada. With a current worth of $69.2 million, the corporation now possesses approximately 3,091 Bitcoin. Blockchain Hive shares jumped  almost 90% in the last month. Japanese video game developer NEXON has been in business since 1994. At the time of writing, the corporation has 1,717 BTC, valued at $38,458,825 on the market. Bitcoin is one of the non-gaming sectors that NEXON has invested in as part of its diversification strategy. With a market valuation of more than $20 billion, the corporation is in a good financial position. A Canadian cryptocurrency dealer named Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The corporation has 1,239 BTC as of March 2023, valued at $27,752,175 at today’s market rates. Data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shows the balance held in Binance’s wallets has increased by more than 52,000 BTC ($1.5 billion) in four weeks, taking the tally to 692,880 BTC. The global tally (coins held on all centralized exchanges) has increased by more than 27,000 BTC. Despite concerns voiced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), CEO Changpeng Zhao has confirmed the company’s support for Voyager’s acquisition by Binance US. Public firms are becoming more aware of the benefits of Bitcoin investments and holding, and astute investors can participate without abandoning the stock market. Investing in any of the aforementioned businesses will give you indirect access to the cryptocurrency market. These top 10 players have proven they are willing to investigate investment opportunities and take calculated risks in the ever changing bitcoin market. What remains to be seen is how these businesses will modify and develop their investing strategies once Bitcoin firmly establishes its status as a mature asset."

Kennedy Jr., a Democratic presidential contender, admitted to owning a sizeable quantity of Bitcoin after originally denying it and giving the cryptocurrency to his wife. Nevertheless, his campaign claims that there is no conflict of interest. Kennedy gave a keynote speech at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami in May and lauded Bitcoin, saying the network should be nourished and safeguarded. He added that Bitcoin donations would be accepted for his campaign. But he also made it clear to conference attendees that he did not own Bitcoin and that his support for the asset did not constitute investing advice. Kennedy also compared his position to that of the current U.S. president and cited Biden’s proposed 30% excise tax on cryptocurrency miners, arguing it would require a “invasive surveillance apparatus to monitor what is happening in individual computers” and would be unwise to set such a precedent. Kennedy’s family does, however, appear to have between $100,000 and $250,000 worth of Bitcoin in a brokerage account as of June 30, according to a financial declaration acquired by CNBC. According to the report, which does not specify when the transaction was made, Kennedy’s family earned less than $201 from the purchase. Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich, Kennedy’s campaign manager, commented  that there was no conflict of interest and that the purchase happened following Kennedy’s supportive comments about Bitcoin in Miami. Following the article’s publication, Kennedy’s campaign initially informed the public that the Bitcoin belonged to Kennedy’s wife, Cheryl Hines, who is well-known for her work on the television program “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” Later, a Kennedy campaign official clarified that they were wrong and that Kennedy actually did own the Bitcoin investment. While Vivek Ramaswamy and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have both made an effort to court the Bitcoin vote, Kennedy has been a steadfast backer of Bitcoin among Democratic contenders. Kennedy has tweeted less frequently about Bitcoin since Miami, and the subject was not brought up during his lengthy one-on-one interview with Twitter CEO Elon Musk last month. Nevertheless, Kennedy has occasionally continued to support the oldest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, he claimed on June 27, “is not only a bulwark against totalitarianism and the manipulation of our money supply, but it also points the way toward a future in which governmental institutions are more open and democratic.” As president, I will make sure that your right to use and hold Bitcoin is inviolable.

According to a recent Echelon Insights study, 65% of people would support Biden over Kennedy, who would be chosen by only 14% of respondents. Joe Biden, the current president of the United States, launched his reelection campaign on April 25. He is currently the likely favorite to be the Democratic Party’s choice for president. The 2023 Economic Report of the President, which includes a section on cryptocurrency for the first time since it started in 1950, may best capture Biden’s perspective on cryptocurrencies. The purpose of this section was to refute the “Perceived Appeal of Crypto Assets.” It suggested that many of cryptocurrency’s “touted” benefits are unattainable and that “many of them have no fundamental value.” Biden has advocated against what he calls “tax loopholes” for cryptocurrency and even opposed a deal with Republicans to raise the debt ceiling because, in his words, it protected “wealthy tax cheats and crypto traders.” We don’t have to guess what MAGA House Republicans value.

2024-04-17 14:53:00+00:00,The Next Bitcoin Halving is Soon — But What Happens if BTC Mining is No Longer Profitable?,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-halving-soon-mining-not-profitable/,"Crypto fans are hoping that a once-every-four-years event, in this case – Bitcoin halving, that modifies the fundamental code of the largest cryptocurrency in the world, will prolong the recent market upswing. But the achievement could also spell the end for some Bitcoin miners. The quadrennial occurrence, rather menacingly known as “the Halving” or “Halvening,” is typically followed by exponential increases in the price of Bitcoin. According to reports , the token increased by roughly 8,450%, 290%, and 560% each of the previous three manifestations in 2012, 2016, and 2020. Under the alias Satoshi Nakamoto, a computer programmer or group of programmers created Bitcoin in 2009. As the name implies, halvings reduce by half the amount of Bitcoin that each miner can receive for utilizing specialized, high-power-exploiting computers to verify transactions on the blockchain of the digital asset. The next halving, scheduled for April 2024, will reduce miners’ incentives from the current 6.25 Bitcoin per block, or $188,876, to 3.125 Bitcoin per block, or $94,438. Crypto enthusiasts believe that the limited supply will assist in keeping Bitcoin’s price stable over time, or at least until 21 million tokens, the maximum amount that can ever be mined, are produced in the year 2140. Due to price spikes following each reward halving and improvements in mining rig efficiency brought about by technological developments, miners have so far been able to make up for the cash lost when payouts are reduced. However, the mining economy seems worse than before the next halving. As a result of their less effective mining operations and higher expenditures, Jaran Mellerud, a crypto-mining expert at Hashrate Index, forecasted that “nearly half of the miners will suffer.” He made reference to the break-even electricity price for the most popular mining machine, which is predicted to go from 12 cents/kWh to six cents/kWh following a halving. According to Mellerud, about 40% of miners still have higher operational expenses per kWh. He stated that smaller miners and those that outsource the operation of their mining rigs will find it difficult to survive, as will those whose running costs are higher than 8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wolfie Zhao, head of research at TheMinerMag, a research division of mining consultancy BlocksBridge, continued, “If you factor in everything, the total cost for some miners is well above Bitcoin’s current price.” Many miners with less productive operations will see a decline in net income. Although the price of Bitcoin has increased by more than 80% this year to over $30,000, it is still less than half of the record high of almost $69,000 set in late 2021. The cost of production for miners has increased along with the cost of electricity, and for many of them, their debt loads are now unmanageable. According to Ethan Vera, chief operations officer at cryptocurrency mining services provider Luxor Technologies, the worldwide mining sector has a debt of $4.5 billion to $6 billion, down from $8 billion in 2022. This debt consists of senior debt, loans secured by mining equipment, and loans backed by Bitcoin. At the end of the first quarter, outstanding debts for 12 large publicly traded mining businesses, including Marathon Digital Holdings and Riot Platforms, were roughly $2 billion, down from $2.3 billion the previous quarter, according to statistics provided by Hashrate Index. After China’s communist government banned domestic mining in the latter half of 2021, miners from that country moved to North America, contributing to the borrowing boom.  The financial market was one item the miners lacked, according to Zhao. “Debt financing is much more readily available in the US.” Profit margins have also shrunk as a result of increased competition among Bitcoin miners. According to data from btc.com , mining difficulty, a measure of the computational power required to generate Bitcoin, reached a record high in June. Bitcoin will need to increase to $50,000–$60,000 next year, according to Kevin Zhang, senior vice president of mining strategy at cryptocurrency mining company Foundry, which industry giant Digital Currency Group owns, for miners to maintain the same profit margins after the halving. And while miners had a little break early this year when electricity prices dropped and Bitcoin’s price recovered following a protracted crypto winter, power costs are now rising once more. Texas, a significant crypto hub, is currently going through an early heat wave.  Before the halving, Bitcoin miners are taking a number of precautions to safeguard themselves, including locking in power pricing, increasing war chests, and reducing investment. When it comes to the actual halving, Zhang explained that miners are getting ready by attempting to be more intelligent with their power bills and securing the pricing from their power providers in advance. In order to protect its Bitcoin treasury before the halving, Hut 8 Mining Corp. signed into a $50 million credit facility last month with a division of Coinbase Global Inc. Additionally, Texas-based Bitcoin miner Lotta Yotta is shoring up six months’ worth of cash flow while reducing investments in order to get ready for the occasion, according to Tiffany Wang, the company’s CEO. Regarding new investment in Bitcoin mining facilities, Wang texted, “During halving year, it is high risk.” “To keep the business running, it is preferable to save some money in the account.” According to JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the halving is anticipated to ultimately double Bitcoin’s production cost to around $40,000 in a June 1 note. According to data gathered by TheMinerMag, the cost of mining one Bitcoin in the first quarter varied between around $7,200 and $18,900 among a cohort of 14 publicly-traded miners. According to Zhao, the expenditures determined do not take into account other significant costs such debt interest payments, managerial salary, or marketing. Everyone needs to be ready, Wang emphasized. Sadly, a large number of miners will eventually be forced out of the market."

Key Takeaways
 Vitalik Buterin highlighted fundamental differences between the core design of Bitcoin and its smart contract pioneering predecessor Ethereum having trade-offs during a widely-tuned-into Twitter Space on July 6 . Buterin, who co-founded Ethereum alongside eight  other influential cryptocurrency developers, spoke at length with Bitcoin advocates Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer about the technical and cultural nuances of either protocol. “I think they’re definitely different experiments in terms of the culture and unavoidable trade offs that they’re making and that’s something that I’ve only really come to realize over time.” Buterin believes there is great value in Bitcoin and Ethereum continuing to co-exist, while admitting he had separated the technical and cultural aspects as best he could  “When I was starting with Ethereum I was looking at them as a kind of technical systems and cultural systems somewhat separately. I had my beliefs on culture, that maximalism is crazy.” Buterin said he had focused on taking a system from Bitcoin, which was fairly basic, and creating a more programmable system that mirrors “how computers evolved”. With technological and cultural aspects intermingled in the development of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, Buterin highlighted the inevitable trade-offs of these systems. “There are points at which you have to make certain choices. Like if you make a system that supports more functionality, then any kind of functionality that you support ends up having risks, right? Buterin said that extensive functionality requires protocol complexity, but functionality itself can introduce risks to a blockchain system. “That’s an example of something that we saw during the last few years.” Ethereum, which originally employed Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus algorithm, shifted to proof-of-stake consensus in 2022 during the highly anticipated Merge.  The change in its core consensus protocol saw stakers introduced as the new ‘miners’ of the network. Staking 32 ETH is required to be a validator, which then receives rewards for processing transactions and maintaining the network.  The change also caused a split within the Ethereum community as Buterin highlighted, referring to the Ethereum DAO fork of 2016  which caused a fork in the chain, leaving ETH as we know it today and Ethereum Classic (ETC) as two separate chains.  “A lot of the people who were in favor of a more purist approach toward immutability ended up going to Ethereum Classic and people who are much stronger proof of work proponents.” Buterin believes that many of the “subtle choices” made by both protocols in terms of functionality end up providing value and continue to co exist.  “There’s just like a lot of these subtle choices that both platforms have made that like really go beyond the question of being general purpose or not trying to be general purpose?” Highlighting a plethora of differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum which ended up in either protocols “choosing different trade offs” down the line.  “The result of all this is that we have these two different experiments that seem to me to be valuable. I’m happy that they’re both continuing to exist.” Buterin added that both protocols can also be considered “more honorable” than “overinflated” scams that the cryptocurrency space has been littered with over the years.  “I do think that there is a kind of core commitment to values in there that I think is valuable for the space to actually provide something that matters to people.” Another central theme emphasized by Buterin was the need for blockchain to move beyond its current limitations by prioritizing scalability: “We need to find ways to scale up blockchain systems to handle a larger number of transactions without sacrificing security or decentralization.”  This sentiment echoes the growing consensus within the industry, as developers and innovators strive to enhance the capabilities of blockchain networks."
2024-04-19 13:24:00+00:00,Bitcoin Ordinals Volume Tops $210 Million in Q2 — Is This the Next NFT Wave?,https://www.ccn.com/news/bitcoin-ordinals-volume-210-million-next-nft-wave/,"According to the most recent quarterly report from DappRadar , the establishment of Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain has generated more than $210 million in trade volume but the NFT market kept decreasing. The information demonstrates how the rapidly rising demand for Bitcoin Ordinals resulted in a dramatic rise in trade volume through the second quarter of 2023. By the end of June, the annual average trading volume for Bitcoin had grown to $210.7 million from $7.18 million in the first quarter. According to DappRadar, the quarterly rise was 2834%. The research further claims that, by the second quarter of 2023, there were approximately 550,000 all-time Ordinals trades, with almost 150,000 different traders adding to the exaggerated trading volume. The number of unique users surged significantly starting in May 2023, according to a Dune blockchain analytics dashboard  showing multiple Bitcoin Ordinals marketplace indicators from the user domo. The majority of unique users by marketplace are represented by UniSat, an open-source Chrome browser extension for Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, Magic Eden, and Ordinals Wallet. The non-fungible token (NFT) environment has been interestingly impacted by the growth of Bitcoin Ordinals. Bitcoin overtook Solana to become the second-most popular NFT blockchain around the end of May 2023, leaving Ethereum as the leading cryptocurrency blockchain in terms of NFT trade volumes. Through the first half of 2023, BTC miners have made almost $184 million, with Coin Metrics praising Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens for their contribution to the increase in fees that has already eclipsed 2022’s total for BTC miners. In a tweet  on July 6, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin thanked Bitcoin Ordinals for reviving a “builder culture” within the Bitcoin community. Each individual Bitcoin satoshi (the currency’s smallest unit) has a value according to the Bitcoin Ordinal theory, a numbering system. Inscriptions can then be made on a particular sat with numbered sats. These inscriptions are collections of arbitrary data and information that may be directly inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain in nearly any format. Although they are more commonly thought of as digital artifacts, Ordinals are comparable to NFTs in that they become unique with inscribed data. Ordinal inscriptions were made possible by the Bitcoin updates SegWit and Taproot, which among other things, increased block size. Ordinals saw a significant increase in attention and buzz, similar to other new cryptocurrency ventures. However, interest began to wane, albeit only slightly. However, BRC-20 and BRC-721 tokens later appeared and maintained the level of interest. Ideas began to bloom as people became aware of the potential of these recent advances on the Bitcoin network. BRC-721 followed BRC-20. The appearance of Ordinals in the community stirred up old debates about network congestion and the optimal applications for Bitcoin. However, it didn’t end with Ordinals. The BRC-20 token standard followed. In March 2023, a new “token standard” was established and given the name “ERC-20” in honor of Ethereum’s ERC-20 token. The fact that BRC-20 tokens are not fully fledged standards or specifications sets them apart from other token standards. In reality, BRC-20 tokens are just a small piece of JSON code embedded in an Ordinal. Their goal is to produce tokens that are semi-fungible on the Bitcoin blockchain. They are comparable to ERC-20 tokens in this regard. Similar to Ethereum’s ERC-721, the BRC-721E token standard was developed for NFTs. ERC-721, on the other hand, enables users to bridge conventional NFTs from Ethereum to Bitcoin, as opposed to merely encoding Ordinals as NFTs. Users can bridge NFTs from Ethereum by sending them to a burn address, which results in the creation of BRC-721E tokens. A low resolution version of the NFT is used to inscribe metadata onto the ERC-20 token after it has been teleburned. Additionally, the burned ERC-20 token with the full-quality NFT is mentioned in the inscription. Some of the best ideas in the realm of cryptocurrencies, like many new innovations, begin as memes. On Bitcoin, BRC-20 tokens started the memecoin season, and some of the NFTs that are being bridged from Ethereum are exactly as absurd as one could imagine. But these new concepts are introducing the globe to all these new advances on Bitcoin, beyond the excitement, fun, and copying in. For many years, Bitcoin has been seen as a digital currency with limited applications. The novel use cases that the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol has generated are encouraging advancements. Additionally, they are increasing demand for layer 2 Bitcoin solutions.2. The popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals sharply increased last quarter, but the overall NFT market continued to decline. The second quarter of this year saw NFT trading volume hit $2.9 billion, a 38% decrease from the first quarter, according to the DappRadar study. But the analysis warned against comparing trade volume with the intensity of market fervor. “A decrease in trade volume doesn’t always signify a decline in market activity or interest. This is demonstrated by the fact that there were 18.6 million sales in Q2, a 9.2% decline. The survey also revealed a fall in trading volume of 34% at Blur, the current largest NFT marketplace, during the quarter. OpenSea, the long-time market leader, suffered much more, with a more than 56% decline in trade volume. Immutable X Marketplace and JPG Store, on the other hand, defied the general trend and showed substantial increases in their trading volumes of 37% and 64%, respectively. This shows “a positive outlook for these platforms amid a challenging market environment,” according to the report. Nevertheless, Bitcoin is currently down 3% from yesterday’s price of $30,170. The leading cryptocurrency, however, has increased by more than 13% over the past month and by 81% YTD."
