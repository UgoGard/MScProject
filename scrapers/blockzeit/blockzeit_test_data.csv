This indicates that for the next 210,000 blocks following the event, Bitcoin mining will only yield 3.125 BTC per block from the prior cycle’s 6.25 BTC per block. This should cut down the daily mining production of the blockchain from the previous average of 900 BTC to 450 BTC. As a recap, Bitcoin mining serves a vital function in the very fabric of the BTC ecosystem. The miners ensure the validation and confirmation of transactions happening on the blockchain. The process also paves the way for the creation of new units of BTC in its economy until the digital currency’s 21 million supply cap is reached. What’s so interesting in the Bitcoin halving that occurred hours ago is it didn’t bleed the largest crypto by market cap below $55K as some bleak predictions suggested. It went on its business as usual, moving sideways between the $63,600 and $64,700 zones. BTC’s only significant price movement in the past 24 hours (as of this writing at 2:00 AM UTC on Saturday) was its decline to $59,651.39 at 2:00 AM on Friday based on Coinmarketcap data. However, its values immediately recovered over $62,000 an hour later and another steep climb to $65,481.60 occurred before settling at $63,700 at the moment. So far, the current prices represent more than a 4% increase in BTC across the 24-hour chart. But then again, it’s still 3.81% less in the past seven-day frame and roughly 6% down in the one-month range. Nevertheless, BTC remains notably 120% up within the one-year period. The recent chain of events only shows that many investors, especially institutions, are now on the watch at every buying opportunity in the crypto asset. Should the aggressive buying spree continue this cycle, especially with the arrival of more spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) overseas, it could potentially catalyze a supply crunch. This could lead the prime digital asset to all-new heights from its current ceiling of $73,750.07. With numerous analysts agreeing that Bitcoin may be on a trajectory toward $100K by year-end while others even suggest it could pop to $200K by 2025, such a super bullish scenario may not be far behind."
2024-04-19 13:50:59+00:00,The Impact Of The Bitcoin Halving On The Price,https://blockzeit.com/the-impact-of-the-bitcoin-halving-on-the-price/,"The Bitcoin Halving is a fixed event within the Bitcoin network that takes place approximately every four years. The reward that miners receive for adding a new block to the blockchain is halved. Originally, miners received 50 bitcoins per block, but the reward has halved several times over the years and currently amounts to 6.25 bitcoins per block. This event is deeply rooted in the protocol of the Bitcoin network and is primarily used to control inflation and gradually approach the maximum amount in circulation of 21 million bitcoins. Bitcoin Halving is an automated process within the Bitcoin protocol that aims to halve the amount of newly generated Bitcoins per block. This happens every 210,000 blocks, which takes approximately four years, based on the average time it takes to mine a block. The process is a core component of the deflationary nature of cryptocurrency, which aims to avoid inflation and increase the value of the currency in the long term. When Bitcoin was launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 bitcoins per block. This reward is halved every four years through halving: Bitcoin blocks are created through the mining process, where miners solve complex mathematical problems to validate and add new blocks to the blockchain. The average time it takes to mine a block is estimated to be around 10 minutes. However, this time can vary as it depends on the overall computing power of the network, which is measured in the hashrate. Bitcoin Halving block rewards It is important to understand that the actual time between blocks can be random, depending on the fluctuation of the network hashrate. This can sometimes result in blocks being found faster or slower than the 10-minute target. The Bitcoin protocol adjusts the difficulty of mining every 2,016 blocks to ensure that the average block time remains close to 10 minutes. This “difficulty adjustment” is crucial to keep the release rate of new bitcoins constant and secure the network. Limiting the amount of Bitcoin to a maximum of 21 million is a crucial factor that supports the deflationary nature of the currency. By halving, this upper limit is gradually reached without more Bitcoins ever being created. This artificial scarcity is intended to help ensure price stability and avoid inflation, similar to precious metals such as gold. Halving not only reduces the amount of new bitcoins introduced into the system, but also affects the profitability of mining. Miners receive a reward for their block processing and network security efforts in the form of newly generated bitcoins and transaction fees. With each halving of the block reward, the direct remuneration from the new minting of Bitcoins decreases, which increases the importance of transaction fees in the miners’ income. The next halving after 2024 is expected to take place in 2028, with the reward decreasing to around 1.5625 bitcoins per block. This progressive reduction will continue until the block reward tends towards zero, which is expected to be reached in 2140. From this point, no more new bitcoins will be generated through mining and the only reward for miners will be transaction fees. These planned halvings are fundamental to understanding the economics of Bitcoin and play a central role in the long-term strategy of investors and users of the Bitcoin network. Their implications are profound, both in terms of the macroeconomics of the cryptocurrency and the individual strategies of miners and other market participants. Read also: Bitcoin Halving – mechanisms, forecasts and factors influencing price development The dynamics of the Bitcoin price are not only influenced by internal events such as the halving, but also by external market theories and the behavior of market participants. At the heart of the discussion is speculation, which can cause both short-term volatility and long-term price support. Market theory states that the price of an asset is determined by the balance of supply and demand. For Bitcoin, this means that any change in the quantity available (for example, due to halving) or a change in demand (due to new investors or changing perceptions) can affect the price. Halving reduces the supply of new bitcoins coming onto the market. If demand remains constant or increases, this could theoretically lead to a higher price. Historical data shows that halvings in the past have often been followed by a price increase, with this effect sometimes being priced in months before the actual event. Market participants often anticipate upcoming events and adjust their trading strategies accordingly. In the case of the Bitcoin Halving, it is a widely known and predictable event, which means that many of its effects may already be priced in before the actual Halving. This means that the actual act of halving may not have an abrupt impact on the price, as the market has already adjusted in advance. Read also: The looming demise of the US dollar and the role of Bitcoin in the future financial world Speculation plays a central role in the pricing of Bitcoin. The volatility of Bitcoin is sometimes high, as speculative trades make up a large part of the trading volume. Bitcoin price development after halvingBefore and after a halving, speculative waves can cause prices to fluctuate considerably. Traders try to profit from the expected movements, which can lead to short-term price changes that do not necessarily reflect long-term market fundamentals. For example, the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) can lead to a rapid price increase, as has sometimes been observed in the months leading up to a halving. In the long term, many investors are betting on the scarcity of Bitcoin as the main price driver. The theory is that due to the fixed cap of 21 million Bitcoins and the reduction in new supply caused by the halving, the currency will rise in value against inflationary fiat currencies. This long-term speculative view often supports a general upward trend in price, although significant setbacks can occur due to market cycles and external events. In addition to internal mechanisms, external events also have a significant impact on the Bitcoin price. Geopolitical uncertainties, economic crises and regulatory developments can all have a significant impact. For example, geopolitical tensions or economic crises in the past have led to increased demand for Bitcoin as a “safe haven”, which can drive prices up in the short term. Interestingly, Bitcoin shows periods of both correlation and decorrelation with traditional markets such as stock indices and precious metals. In times of global financial uncertainty, Bitcoin can be seen as either a safe haven or a risky asset, depending on general market sentiment and specific circumstances, which can lead to a complex and often counter-intuitive market reaction. The interplay of internal events such as halving and external market influences results in a dynamic and often volatile market environment for Bitcoin. Speculation, both short and long term, plays a crucial role in this and is further amplified by Bitcoin’s unique characteristics, such as its limited supply and decentralized nature. Analyzing these factors is essential for understanding Bitcoin’s price performance and for strategizing investors and traders in this market. Read also: Detailed analysis of the Bitcoin Halving and its implications The long-term outlook of Bitcoin, especially after a halving, remains a key topic in the crypto world. While the direct impact of a halving on the short-term price may prove to be minimal, the long-term effects on supply, demand and market psychology are much more incisive. Reduction in supply and inflation Each halving effectively reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are created from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoins per block in the next event in 2024. This reduction in supply, if demand remains the same or increases, has traditionally led to an increase in the price of Bitcoin. It is important to note that this halves Bitcoin’s inflation rate, which makes Bitcoin more attractive compared to inflationary fiat currencies such as the US dollar, whose money supply is constantly increasing. Scarcity and increase in value The maximum quantity of 21 million Bitcoins is a fundamental feature that positions Bitcoin as a store of value similar to gold. The scarcity of supply enforced by halving can be seen as a kind of automated, predictable monetary policy aimed at promoting value stability and combating inflationary trends. Stock-to-flow model (S2F) The stock-to-flow model, which is often used to value precious metals such as gold and silver, is also applied to Bitcoin and predicts potentially higher prices after each halving. The model measures the ratio between the existing quantity of an asset (stock) and the quantity that is newly produced each year (flow). A higher ratio indicates a higher scarcity and theoretically a higher price. For Bitcoin, the model shows that after each halving, if the flow rate is halved, the value of Bitcoin could increase, assuming that demand remains the same or grows. Long-term market acceptance The increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a means of payment and as an investment, reinforced by the involvement of institutions such as Fidelity and BlackRock, supports the assumption that demand for Bitcoin will continue to rise. This development could continue to drive price increases, especially in times of economic uncertainty when investors are increasingly investing in non-inflationary assets. Regulatory developments Bitcoin is increasingly the focus of regulatory monitoring worldwide. Strict regulations could limit the acceptance and free trade of Bitcoin, which could affect its price and popularity. Technological and security aspects Further developments in blockchain technology or serious security breaches could also have a significant impact on the price of Bitcoin. While technological improvements such as the implementation of Schnorr signatures or Taproot could improve the functionality and efficiency of Bitcoin, security incidents could shake confidence in Bitcoin. The future of Bitcoin after a halving looks promising, but not without caveats. While Bitcoin’s scarcity and predictable monetary policy are fundamental strengths that could support its value in the long term, much depends on external factors such as the global economic situation, regulatory decisions and technological developments. Investors should keep these variables in mind when evaluating Bitcoin’s long-term price performance after a halving. The Bitcoin Halving is a key event in Bitcoin’s life cycle that can have significant short and long-term effects on the price. While short-term effects are often quickly absorbed by the markets, the halving could lead to an increased perception of Bitcoin as a valuable, scarce asset in the long term. However, as with all investments, uncertainties remain and investors should be aware of the many variables that can affect the market.

2024-04-19 10:13:02+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Struggles To Regain ATH, As Runes Hype Hits The Ceiling",https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-price-struggles-to-regain-ath-as-runes-hype-hits-the-ceiling/,"Bitcoin marketcap dominance is up again for the fifth week consecutive, indicating that the altcoins are not doing so well. Perhaps its the anticipation of the Bitcoin halving event that most of the liquidity is flowing into the asset.  After April 20, 2024, BTC supply will only be increasing by about 3,000 BTC every week, instead of the current ~6,000 BTC. Last week, Bitcoin price did well despite the selling pressure. The asset managed to stay above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart, with only $72,266 as the immediate overhead resistance. This week, the selling pressure intensified, and Bitcoin dropped from $70,717 last week to $63, 745 today. This represents an over 10% drop.  The fall effectively put the BTC price action below the 50-day and 200-day SMA on the 4-hour chart, painting a death cross. The previous moving average indicators that acted as supports may now act as resistance, as seen on the chart (price action is trending below the 50-day SMA, making lower lows) The daily chart shows a different story. The price of Bitcoin is stuck between $62,000 and the 50-day SMA. The $62,000 support level has only been tested once before, which is not good for Bitcoin since bears can easily break through it.On the other hand, the price action seems to be in a larger consolidation phase, giving hope that it may rise up to the upper boundary. This would be a  12% increase, and would Bitcoin back above $70,000. If BTC’s price breaks below the $62,000 support, we could see lows of $53,650 and $50,477. However, if Bulls succeed in pushing the price upward, $73,000, $76,948, and $82,612 could be in the works.

2024-04-18 02:51:46+00:00,Bitcoin Halving: What To Expect From This Pivotal Event In Crypto Space,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-halving-what-to-expect-from-this-pivotal-event/,"For those left unaware of the upcoming party, the halving is one of the deflationary mechanisms of Bitcoin to ensure its scarcity. It basically reduces the block mining rewards of its ecosystem by half at every 210,000th block in roughly four years. The 19th of April affair will mark the fourth instance of the halving and the cycle is pre-programmed to trigger occassionally until the 21 million supply cap of BTC has been extracted. In this cycle, the Bitcoin blockchain rewards miners with 6.25 BTC per block. The next epoch will cut the numbers down to 3.125 BTC, which will result in a tighter supply amid the aggressive accumulation of institutions nowadays. Among the primary hoarders of the digital asset at present are the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers in the US led by BlackRock. The countdown to the halving is about to hit zero tomorrow, hence, analysts warn that those who want to hop on the train at the moment may find themselves late for the party. As former Bitmex CEO Arthur Hayes said, the next few weeks until May 1 is going to be a no-trade zone for him. Although there’s a good shorting opportunity for traders with a high appetite for risk, they should tread with caution. Bitcoin is yet to recover from its slump on Saturday as Iran’s recent attack on Israel wiped out its building-up momentum at the $70K line. Now, this is causing some analysts like Gryphon Digital Mining CEO Rob Chang to ponder whether or not the halving has already been priced in. Chang, who was also Riot Platforms’ former CFO, factored in his assessment the likely climb in value of the US dollar amid the Federal Reserve’s cautious stance on cutting interest rates in the short run, which could present a juicy shorting chance. The ensuing massive selling pressure by halving would further reinforce their move. However, if their bearish positions would suddenly swing on the upside in favor of the bulls, a supply squeeze may happen at their expense. Overall, the consensus is bullish on the potential of Bitcoin post-halving. Besides the higher institutional demand brewing up, Chang noted the dipping prices around halving presents a good buying opportunity for institutional investors. In relation to this, analysts have predicted soaring prices for BTC hitting at least $100K in the cycle following the halving. The Motley Fool, Rekt Capital, Peter Brandt, Robert Kiyosaki, and CryptoJobs founder (with the handle “The Moon” on X) have maintained a bullish outlook until year-end. Sharing the same sentiment is Animoca Brands founder Yat Siu with an added forecast saying that a unit of BTC could boom to $1 million “in the near future,” echoing Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood’s $1.48 million BTC projection by 2030."
2024-04-17 10:17:55+00:00,Doomsday Rally Could Launch Bitcoin To $120K,https://blockzeit.com/doomsday-rally-could-launch-bitcoin-to-120k/,"In the past few years, Bitcoin has started showing a strong correlation with traditional markets. This was further influenced by the introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US last January. As reported earlier, BTC is now exhibiting the same behavior as other ETFs and US stocks since the arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. This is due to the fact that a lot of human traders and bots have begun synchronizing their buying and selling patterns with them. Despite this change in dynamics, some financial analysts still believe Bitcoin has not lost its luster as the “digital gold.” It should be noted that the crypto was conceptualized in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and was subsequently launched in 2009. Thus, by design, it has always been intended to go out of its way from the traditional mold of the financial market. Tyr Capital CIO Edoauard Hindi claimed in his email to Coindesk that Bitcoin is still a viable “doomsday asset” to this day. He added that it presents investors with an avenue to diversify their wealth outside the confines of traditional assets. Hindi likewise pointed out that the correlation between Bitcoin and gold continues to strengthen. This is supported by the recent data of Longtermtrends, which displays a one-year rolling correlation coefficient of 0.97 for the two. The numbers translate to a very high positive correlation between the world’s oldest hedge and its digital alternative due to the reason that a score of +1 already indicates a perfect positive correlation for the assets in question. The analyst stated the spot Bitcoin ETFs could be the primary catalyst of the coming Doomsday rally if the hostilities continue around the globe. And if that happens, we should prepare for its launch to $120K in the coming months as the middle class will likely continue hedging their wealth in the most accessible hard asset out there. It’s not clear, however, if the expert has even factored in the upcoming halving in his assessment. If not, the tighter supply post-halving could provide more leverage to his forecast. As of this writing at 10:00 AM UTC on Wednesday, Bitcoin remains stuck at $63,300 as it continues to hit a roadblock around a $64,000 resistance. The figures are notably over 8% down on a one-week basis after the Iran-Israel tension last Saturday halted BTC’s momentum toward its halving. With the hostilities in the Middle East not showing any point of slowing down, it remains to be seen how Bitcoin will move in the next few days as it nears its halving around the evening of April 19 (at UTC standard)."
2024-04-17 05:27:00+00:00,Former Bitmex CEO Arthur Hayes Predicts “Slump” In Prices Around The Bitcoin Halving,https://blockzeit.com/former-bitmex-ceo-arthur-hayes-predicts-slump-in-prices-around-the-bitcoin-halving/,"Former Bitmex CEO and current Maelstrom CIO Arthur Hayes has a bleak outlook on the Bitcoin halving day. According to the American entrepreneur who is now based in Japan, the upcoming event is certainly viewed by the consensus as a bullish affair for the general crypto market as the prices will likely pump in the medium term, but the same couldn’t be said at the time of the halving. He opined prices right before and after the crucial event could turn to the negative side. The former Bitmex boss claimed that although a positive narrative for the halving is “well entrenched,” the market tends to behave the opposite of what most participants have anticipated. He also anchored his forecast on the tighter dollar liquidity against the backdrop of Bitcoin’s shift to another cycle. “I believe bitcoin and crypto prices in general will slump around the halving,” Hayes warned. “Given that the halving occurs at a time when dollar liquidity is tighter than usual, it will add propellant to a raging fire sale of crypto assets.” Given the uncertainty of dealing with risky assets this mid-April, Hayes explained he will abstain from trading from April 15 to May 1. “This is when tax payments remove liquidity from the system, QT [Quantitative Tightening] rumbles on at the current elevated pace, and [Treasury Secretary Janet] Yellen has yet to start running down the TGA [Government’s Treasury General Account].” On the brighter side of things, Hayes ensured it would be “back to regular programming” by May as the US continues to grapple with its shaky economy that’s characterized by rising inflation. Add to that the nation’s growing debt because of its uncontrolled government spending, especially now that it’s nearing the Presidential Election. Meanwhile, Hayes noted the macro shows a favorable time to short the market for those bold enough to do so. But then again, he would not be participating in that and has instead closed his shitcoin and memecoin trading positions to mitigate his risks. As of this writing at 5:00 AM UTC on Wednesday, Bitcoin appears to be showing a bounce back to the $64,200 line. Whether it could sustain its foothold in this territory as the countdown for the halving nears zero remains to be seen. There are roughly 400 blocks left until the block height of Bitcoin reaches 840,000, which will trigger the halving. At this rate, the pivotal event in the BTC ecosystem will most probably occur around the evening of April 19 at UTC standard."
2024-04-16 16:58:49+00:00,Bloomberg Analyst Downplays Hong Kong Bitcoin And Ethereum ETF Potentials,https://blockzeit.com/bloomberg-analyst-downplays-hong-kong-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etf-potentials/,"News broke on Monday that the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) approved in principle some pending spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF filings. Among the applicants that confirmed to have gotten the favorable notice from the regulator were China Asset Manager and Harvest Fund. Meanwhile, Bosera Asset Management and HashKey Capital said they only received conditional approval to operate their ETFs. Just In: #HongKong Approves Spot #BitcoinETF And #EthereumETF ApplicationsAnalysts expect the event to be a catalyst for further all-time highs for #Bitcoin and #Ethereum, as well as other mainstream #altcoins that heavily track their price movements.https://t.co/aHTnl3o4hh It’s not clear yet when will these ETFs launch. The rumor mill has it that it would be by the end of this month. However, there is already an ongoing excitement about the potential boost these new financial instruments in the East could bring on their underlying assets. Bitcoin in particular is about to undergo its cyclical halving around April 20. So, this wider institutional adoption in Asia is anticipated to further raise its demand amid its dwindling daily supply to bump its prices to all-new heights. Despite the high spirits of the crypto community, especially in Asia, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas cleared out that these financial instruments will not be as big as their US versions. First off, he reminded everyone on X that the Hong Kong ETF market is relatively smaller compared to the US. He estimated that the market there is only valued at around $50 billion and Chinese investors couldn’t even access them due to the ban in the mainland. Thus, their potential demand is basically limited. Next, Balchunas pointed out that the approved entities, namely Bosera, China AMC, and Harvest Fund are virtually smaller fishes compared to whales like BlackRock and other key spot Bitcoin ETF players in the West. Moreover, the analyst stated that the Chinese Special Administrative Region (SAR) has a less liquid and less efficient ecosystem. Hence, they may experience “wide spreads and prem discounts.” Furthermore, they may find it hard to match the rates of the issuers in the US. Balchunas projected that these HK spot BTC and ETH ETFs will likely bear 1% to 2% fees. Latest on HK spot Bitcoin ETFs: They have been approved to exist but not launch (yet). Rumor has it launching next wk so to not compete w Dubai conf. Don't expect a lot of flows (I saw one estimate of $25b that's insane). We think they'll be lucky to get $500m. Here's why: 1. HK… Wrapping things up, he noted that although these are “additive,” they are “nickel-dime compared to the mighty US market.” Even when combined with the Ethereum ETFs, he commented that these spot crypto ETFs may only raise up to $500 million in inflows combined. And yes, ether etfs were also approved! Our $500m is estimate for all of them combined."
2024-04-16 14:46:42+00:00,Coinbase Releases An Ad For The Upcoming Bitcoin Halving,https://blockzeit.com/coinbase-releases-an-ad-for-the-upcoming-bitcoin-halving/,"Food for thought:What if money was designed to get you more over time, not less?#Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/z8eHF8JltQ With roughly three days to go until the historic Bitcoin halving, anticipation is now running high for this momentous occasion in the cryptocurrency space. Unlike the first three that happened in 2012, 2016, and 2020, the next one is expected to be the biggest so far due to the heavier involvement of traditional finance (TradFi) in its ecosystem, mainly thanks to the arrival of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. To further fuel anticipation for this important affair, Coinbase just released an infomercial displaying the different purchasing power of Bitcoin over time. It begins with a box of pizza on the carrier of a motorcycle to provide a visual representation of the time when 1 BTC was already enough to buy a whole pizza in 2012. Its price eventually increases each halving every four years until it’s enough to topple and bury the motorcycle beneath a mountain of pizza boxes. In the end, the narrator reminds us that each halving marks a tighter supply and a higher value for Bitcoin. For added context, the event is essentially a deflationary mechanism built within the Bitcoin blockchain that cuts its mining reward by half at each cycle. The cycle goes on until all 21 million BTC has been acquired. Bitcoin started with a 50 BTC reward on January 9, 2009. The Genesis Block and earliest blocks were mined by none other than Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. In the first halving on November 28, 2012, mining rewards were cut down to 25 BTC per block. The second halving on July 9, 2016, brought them down to 12.5 BTC per block. The third cycle where we are right now rewards miners with 6.25 BTC per block. In the upcoming fourth halving around April 20, this will turn to 3.125 BTC per block. Due to the higher awareness by the public and the increased institutional adoption of Bitcoin, the next one is expected to propel Bitcoin to all-new highs. Some analysts are wagering up to $100K per BTC this year up to $200K by 2025. The Coinbase ad somehow offers a subtle callback to the iconic Bitcoin Pizza Day, which is now celebrated annually every 22nd of May. On the same date in 2010, Bitcoin marked its first actual use as a medium of exchange when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz traded 10,000 BTC for two large Papa John’s pizzas. During that period, these were valued at a total of $41 while the overall purchase was only worth $25."
2024-04-16 09:32:48+00:00,10x Research Founder Markus Thielen Projects A Bearish Picture For Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/10x-research-founder-markus-thielen-projects-a-bearish-picture-for-bitcoin/,"10x Research founder Markus Thielen, who correctly predicted Bitcoin’s rise to a new all-time high in February, just made a U-turn on his initially bullish stance for the prime digital asset. According to his recent notes, risk assets, including cryptocurrencies and tech stocks, may be on the verge of a major price correction. Among the foreseen key culprits for the additional drop in their prices is the latest US inflation data that continues to move away from the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. The March figures showing a 3.8% increase in core inflation (excluding volatile food and energy prices) and a 3.5% rise in headline inflation (including food and energy costs) on a year-over-year basis is expected to further delay the much-anticipated interest rate cuts in June. The resilient employment data amid the rising prices of goods and services may also add justification to the Federal Reserve’s lack of urgency in pushing for the rate cuts. “Our growing concern is that risk assets (stocks and crypto) are teetering on the edge of a significant price correction,” warned Thielen in a report to clients on Tuesday. “The primary trigger is the unexpected and persistent inflation.” Meanwhile, Thielen emphasized the more lucrative yields of US government bonds, which may attract risk-averse investors. “With the bond market now projecting less than three cuts and 10-year Treasury Yields surpassing 4.50%, we may have arrived at a crucial tipping point for risk assets,” he added. Thielen confirmed as well that interest in US spot Bitcoin ETFs has somehow hit a roadblock as their five-day net inflows have crashed to zero. As a result of these events, the expert revealed they have unloaded some of their tech stocks but have remained on hold of their promising crypto assets. “We sold all our tech stocks last night (at the open) as the Nasdaq is trading very poorly and reacting to the higher bond yield,” Thielen disclosed. “We only hold a few high-conviction crypto coins.” “Overall, we are bearish risk assets (stocks and crypto),” the analyst summed it all up. Since it lost its footing on Saturday during the Iranian attack on Israel, Bitcoin has seemingly struggled to surpass its resistance around the $66K line. As of this writing at 9:15 AM UTC on Tuesday, BTC is still stuck on the $63,300 mark with over 4% loss in the 24-hour chart, more than 10% dip in the seven-day range, and around 8% slump in the one-month bracket. Nevertheless, it’s still roughly 108% up in the one-year chart as it climbed from a $24,797.17 low to a $73,750.07 high within the larger frame."
2024-04-16 06:19:12+00:00,Norway’s New Legislation Could Evict Bitcoin Mining Firms,https://blockzeit.com/norways-new-legislation-could-evict-bitcoin-mining-firms/,"Norway’s legislature just passed a new law that will require data reporting from data centers. Its main focus is the regulation of cryptocurrency mining, which siphons a huge slice of the energy grid. Of course, the most impacted by this new rule would be Bitcoin mining firms. Time and again, Bitcoin’s reliance on a proof-of-work (PoW) protocol has always been criticized. Basically, this methodology is employed to verify the accuracy of transactions taking place within the blockchain. The trade-off, however, is it’s an energy-intensive process. This was the reason why the US government previously attempted to conduct an Energy Information Administration (EIA) survey to probe the actual energy use of crypto mining firms, especially those engaged in Bitcoin mining, only to be thwarted by the advocates of the digital asset. The Norwegians are undeterred in their effort to curb the progress of this thriving industry though. By far, the country has been one of the top destinations of Bitcoin miners due to its cheap electricity and favorable climate that helps cool their rigs. Arcane Research’s 2022 report estimated that Norway makes up 0.22% of Bitcoin’s global hash rate. The nation’s Digitalization Minister Karianne Tung and Energy Minister Terje Assland confirmed that the new law is indeed directed to crypto mining in general. Unfortunately, the ultimate aim of such legislation is to shut the country’s door to this sector. “The purpose is to regulate the industry in such a way that we can close the door on the projects we do not want,” Tung stated in an interview with VG. Meanwhile, Aasland explained that it’s a way to ensure the prioritization of “socially useful” services and infrastructure in terms of energy allocation. He cleared out that neither crypto nor Bitcoin mining belongs in those categories. “It is associated with large greenhouse gas emissions, and is an example of a type of business we do not want in Norway,” Aasland said with a nod of approval from Tung. “They are not welcome in Norway. “We want serious actors who are important to society, and the society-serving computer industry is important to us,” the Energy Minister added. Critics like Daniel Batten, a managing partner of CH4 Capital, were quick to point out the flaw in the argument of the Norwegian legislature regarding Bitcoin mining. For him, their pronouncements just show that they don’t understand the mechanics of Bitcoin and the process it takes to mine its blocks. He also cleared out on X, “It’s Bitcoin mining, not crypto mining that’s happening in Norway.” The co-founder of CH4 Capital further schooled the people on social media that since Bitcoin is a fully-electrified industry, it does not produce emissions like electric vehicles (EVs). Like EVs, its underlying power source has secondary emissions. In the case of Norway, which sources its energy from renewable hydroelectric plants, it would have presented a very favorable setting for Bitcoin mining, which does not negatively impact the environment. “Bitcoin mining has an ultra-high 55% sustainable energy usage, higher than any other global industry or major industrialized nation,” Batten went on. “That’s the industry you’re attacking?” Lastly, Batten highlighted that such a rule is discriminatory since it only targets a certain sector. Norway Minister of Energy Terje Aasland just told the world he ❌doesn't understand energy, ❌doesn't understand Bitcoin, and ❌doesn't understand emissions in one breath, that takes Norway on a journey backwards.“[Crypto mining] is linked with large greenhouse gas…"

The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."

With the network’s algorithm triggering yet another level of scarcity in the world’s leading cryptocurrency by market cap, more investors are now very bullish on BTC’s potential to reach a new top anytime between this year and the next from the current $73,750.07 peak. Exclusive: Victory Securities internally released the Hong Kong Bitcoin Ethereum spot ETF subscription guide and disclosed its charging standards. Hong Kong securities firms are selling to potential clients.The original text of the picture is in Chinese, using Google Translate… pic.twitter.com/oCqlU6EoSm Alongside them are the spot Bitcoin ETF issuers in the US as they look to capitalize on BTC’s tighter supply, which could result in a new price discovery for the digital asset. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF is particularly enjoying an unprecedented success as it displayed 69 days of unbroken chain of inflows despite the outflows overpowering the market on most days of the week preceding the halving. Last Friday, IBIT recorded $29.3 million in inflows to raise its issuer’s net inflows to $15.42 billion. The company credited the strong performance of its spot Bitcoin ETF, especially with institutional investors, to its strong branding, competitive fee, and strategic distribution. With that, there’s anticipation that BlackRock’s exchange-traded product (ETP) would eventually surpass Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) in assets under management (AUM) under ETFs. In contrast to IBIT, GBTC has logged an alarming $16.73 billion net outflows since its ETF conversion on January 11. Elsewhere, the Securities & Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong (HK) reportedly greenlit several Chinese spot Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs last week but the regulator has yet to give an official announcement regarding the matter. Amid the silence of the agency on the subject, big institutional players like China Asset Management, Harvest Fund, Bosera, and HashKey have begun leaking tidbits of information regarding the approval of their ETF applications. The last two, however, only revealed conditional approval for their ETPs. One of the new names that surfaced in this space is Hong Kong’s Victory Securities. According to Wu Blockchain on X, the issuer will charge 0.5% to 1% of the customer’s total transaction with a minimum fee set at $850. Meanwhile, secondary markets will be charged 0.15% for online transactions and 0.25% for phone transactions.

From the looks of it, other players in the area will unlikely stray farther from these numbers. For Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the Hong Kong spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are setting up more bullish sentiment for the wider crypto market. However, he doused expectations that they would match or perform better than their US counterparts. Balchunas explained that the HK ETF market is relatively small, with an estimated capitalization of $50 billion. He also criticized their limited access due to the crypto ban holding back investors from mainland China. The analyst said the HK crypto ETFs would be lucky to even reach $500 million in inflows."

This means lower rewards for miners within its ecosystem going forward, or a prize of 3.125 BTC per block in the next four years from the last cycle’s 6.25 BTC. Except for the morning prior to the critical juncture in its economy, the halving didn’t bring in a dramatic price movement for Bitcoin. However, against the backdrop of the event was something more exciting happening within the BTC space. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU During the affair, transaction fees spiked as Bitcoin mining operators competed to secure the historic 840,000th block, which served as a bridge between the outgoing and incoming cycles this year. According to mempool, the coveted block eventually fell into the hands of ViaBTC, but it didn’t come without a high gamble. On-chain data revealed miners actually spent a whopping total of $37.67 BTC in mining fees for a chance to get the sought-after block. That’s roughly $2.4 million at the going rate of BTC on Saturday midnight, making it the highest fee paid for a single block on the Bitcoin network. In addition to the fees, ViaBTC bagged 40.7 BTC as a bounty for the 840,000th block, or around $2.6 million. Without hindsight, the high transaction fees may have been too impractical considering the rewards and competition in the space. However, within the 840,000th block lay the possibility of acquiring special satoshis (sats). In a nutshell, a sat is the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Each sat is equivalent to 0.00000001 BTC. Every halving paves the way for “epic sats,” which are considered to be rare artifacts within Bitcoin that are potentially worth millions of dollars. #Bitcoin (#BTC) miners are gearing up to mine the “#EpicSat,” which could fetch millions of dollars.The ultra-rare #satoshi (sat) could come from the first block generated after the halving.https://t.co/usb0EUK0sW Another milestone achieved during the halving was the advent of Runes. This is basically a new token standard on Bitcoin created by Casey Rodarmor, the person behind the Ordinals launched last year. #Runes protocol is launching on April 20, 2024, immediately after #Bitcoinhalving.Runes will perform better than Ordinals but the impact on #Bitcoin fees could be higher.Several pre-rune ordinal projects will be airdropping to rune holders.@soldout_vin https://t.co/wJQf5YUTjQ As of this writing at 2:00 AM UTC, there are already 3,246 Runes etched within the Bitcoin network based on RuneAlpha data. Along the line are 46,1245 transactions from 53,476 holders. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is now trading over $65,000 with around a 2% gain on the 24-hour and seven-day charts. It is more than 4% down on the one-month frame but it’s still treading 130% higher in the one-year range."

Compared to the rest, the upcoming one is now on the radar of a wider audience consisting of not only cryptocurrency traders and investors but also the mainstream media and giant financial institutions. Stakes run higher this time because of the involvement of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers in Wall Street like BlackRock and Fidelity Investments as well as the new entrants from China via the Hong Kong crypto hub. What’s more, BTC miners are currently bracing themselves to mine a rare artifact within the world’s premier blockchain, in the form of an “epic sat.” In 2022, Casey Rodarmor created a method of classifying satoshis or sats, which are the smallest denominations of BTC. A sat is worth a hundred millionth of the digital currency or 0.00000001 BTC. The creator of the Ordinals protocol developed a scale to differentiate each sat from “uncommon” up to “mythic.” Basically, the former is the first sat of each block generated in the Bitcoin blockchain. Meanwhile, “mythic” is used to categorize the first sat in the network’s first-ever block, which is presumably in the safekeeping of the enigmatic Bitcoin developer, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Before the mythic class is the “epic sat,” which is the first sat obtained in the first block made every Bitcoin halving. Only three of them exist to this day and the next halving will mean the birth of the fourth one. Tristan, the co-founder of Ordiscan, estimates the fourth epic sat could be worth around $50 million. The value of the first three units remains a mystery as he claims that none of them have been sold yet. It’s worth noting that the floor price of an uncommon sat sits at $400 in Magic Eden. On top of that is a “rare sat” mined right off the start of each mining difficulty adjustment, which sold for over $100K at a recent Sotheby’s auction. With only 649 blocks to go until the 840,000th block height of Bitcoin as of this writing at 3:00 PM UTC on Monday, the fourth halving will likely arrive by April 20. This year’s halving is set to cut Bitcoin mining reward from the current 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC. Considering the broader adoption of Bitcoin nowadays, especially by institutional players, this event is forecasted to trigger an all-new level of scarcity for BTC, which could propel its price to new heights. Some analysts are even eyeing $100K to $200K for each unit of the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap in 2025. The arrival of the epic sat in the mix only adds more flavor to the incoming Bitcoin halving party."
2024-04-15 09:40:09+00:00,Gary Gensler Has A Point – The Latest Bitcoin Scam,https://blockzeit.com/gary-gensler-has-a-point-the-latest-bitcoin-scam/,"He is correct! The Bitcoin market is full of bad actors, scammers and other unprincipled players. Here’s the thing; the Bitcoin protocol works well, it is reliable, machine driven, secured by many tens of thousands of computers around the world all running the same code. However, if you want to interact with this software, this network, you are likely going to have human interaction. These humans are not subject to oversight, regulation, fit and proper persons tests, examination requirements, continuing professional development programmes. There is essentially no barrier to entry and colossal growth. This attracts wildcatters, all manner of ne’er do wells and outright scammers. I am a freedom and innovation lover, wary of burdensome rules and incumbent large operators shielding themselves from competition by encouraging regulatory hurdle building to stymie new entrants. But what’s to be done? Let me share an example of a fraud perpetrated against me yesterday on the HodlHodl platform. I posted to sell some Bitcoin and a user named Vir popped up and offered to buy €1,016.25 Bitcoin from me. All good so far. The system requires that on acceptance of the trade I send the BTC into escrow pending my confirmation that the Euros are received into my account. I posted the BTC into escrow. Now watch for the sleight of hand. Another user named Crpytomojo offered to buy €1,500, I agreed to this. The BTC took time to get into the mempool so he started another purchase with me, here is a transcript snippet: So what happens next is the magic. He initiates another purchase for exactly the same amount as the Vir user. €1,016.25, (I think this was the minimum set). By 1600 I had released the BTC to Vir, as I had received €1,016.25 from a Goncalo Matias into my bank account matching the contract with Vir. Then I get a message from Crpytomojo confirming our transaction with a bank receipt:    Now I have got confirmation that Crpytomojo is Goncal Matias and has sent the €1,016.25. So I have two separate users both proving that they are Goncalo Matias and having sent €1,016.25 to my account. However, in my account I have received one amount of €1,016.25, not two payments. So I went back to Vir the next morning and asked him for verification that he was the one paying into my account. He was able to confirm the last name of the payee, Matias: I had released BTC to both Vir and Crpytomojo, but only one had paid, but both had been able to confirm the payee name without my offering it. How is this scam possible? The only thing I can imagine is that Vir (with good trading reviews) and Crpytomojo are one and the same person. How else would Crpytomojo know the exact amount and the payee name of Vir? If you know some other way this scam was done please let me know? Meanwhile I emailed HodlHodl and suggested to avoid this double spend attack that a secret unique identifier is provided with each transaction. Otherwise this is likely to be repeated many times. It is a shame that Gary Gensler is right: There are lots of scammers and bad actors in this arena, which makes it a tricky place to operate in, Bitcoin goes tick tock, next block but the people involved go slip slap next trap.

2024-04-15 08:08:38+00:00,Just In: Hong Kong Approves Spot Bitcoin And Ethereum ETF Applications,https://blockzeit.com/just-in-hong-kong-approves-spot-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etf-applications/,"Hong Kong finally makes its move as it does not want to get left behind by the success of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. Today, the Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China one-upped its Western rivals by approving not one but two spot crypto ETFs based on Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH). This is now leading to a renewed optimism in the two largest digital assets by market cap. The positive news comes amidst the ongoing tension between Iran and Israel, which has bled the crypto market dry last Saturday, causing Bitcoin to steer off its momentum at the $70K territory to below $62K as reports about Iran’s bombardment of Israel with drones and missiles began circulating in mainstream media. We are yet to unearth the exact number of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF issuers greenlit by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). However, according to China Asset Management, its unit in the Chinese SAR was just notified of its spot crypto ETFs’ approval in principle from the regulator. Another big fund manager in China, Harvest Fund, reportedly confirmed the same milestone. Meanwhile, Bosera Asset Management and HashKey Capital shared the same update, but in their case, it was a conditional approval. This wave of approvals interestingly comes despite the existing ban of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in mainland China. But then again, the giant Asian nation has always shown a contrasting stance when it came to Hong Kong’s bid to become a crypto hub in Asia. The historic decision of the SFC comes at a very opportune time when BTC is about to hit its fourth halving around April 20. The event is pre-programmed to cut Bitcoin mining rewards in half from the current 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC post-halving. Analysts expect the event to be a catalyst for further all-time highs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as other mainstream altcoins that heavily track their price movements. By far, the consensus is placing their bets on BTC’s potential climb over $100K by year-end and ETH’s price ballooning over $4K along the same timeframe; and this momentous development could just be the right reinforcement they need to sustain the said targets."
2024-04-15 06:01:29+00:00,Is Bitcoin Losing Its Edge As Hedge Against Economic Or Geopolitical Uncertainties?,https://blockzeit.com/is-bitcoin-losing-its-edge-as-hedge-against-economic-or-geopolitical-uncertainties/,"Bitcoin dropped over 8% on Saturday as the world braced itself for the ongoing tensions in the Middle East. During that time, Iran recently responded to the April 1 airstrike in Damascus, which led to the death of its top military asset in both Syria and Lebanon, by sending in over 200 drones and missiles toward Israel. Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system was able to intercept most of the attacks and was able to minimize its losses. However, the real one that took a hit in the hostilities was BTC, which lost its momentum at the $70K range as it approached a significant event in its ecosystem: the halving. Now, this begs the question, “Why?” Bitcoin has always been hyped as a great hedge against economic and geopolitical uncertainties like gold. Now that we may be at the precipice of a larger conflict, why did it just behave negatively? The recent attack of #Iran on #Israel just brought about an all-new level of tension in the #MiddleEast.With “#WorldWar3” trending on X and becoming the talk in newsrooms and other social media circles, #Bitcoin lost its foothold above the $70,000 line and tumbled below the… There’s a simple explanation behind this short-term fluctuation based on the analysis of The Wall Street Journal. According to the report it posted at the time of Iran’s retaliation, the massive price swing in BTC was nothing but a knee-jerk reaction of investors. Since Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could be easily traded 24/7, and considering that the Iran-Israel incident happened at market close heading to the weekend, they were the easiest assets to sell off by cautious investors. Thus, Iran’s attack immediately led to BTC’s price tanking below the $62K mark. It should be noted, however, that prices recovered to $64K roughly a day following the attacks as bullish traders and investors saw a good opportunity to buy the dip. Nevertheless, this only underscores Bitcoin’s flexibility as an asset because of its 24/7 availability for trading. As of this trading at 4:30 AM UTC, Bitcoin has regained more than 1.3% of its value in the 24-hour chart at $64,880. It’s worth discussing that gold price was somehow shaken by the bad news in the Middle East, too. It underwent a correction over the weekend, losing its ground from around $2,430 to $2,330 before its recovery to $2,357 to date. Gold has better accessibility than stocks due to some markets like the Commodity Exchange (COMEX) operating from Sundays to Fridays at Eastern Time standard. Therefore, some of its investors were still able to capitalize on the conflict. Now, if we look back at the charts, Bitcoin and gold are still highly correlated on a wider scale. The data from Longtermtrends indicate the one-year rolling correlation coefficient of the two falling at 0.97, which is only 0.03 points short of having a perfect positive correlation at 1. This only means that the two—one being the world’s oldest hedge while the other being a rising alternative—are still functioning as hard assets amid the problems in the Middle East. Some analysts like Korbit’s Kim Min-Seung have raised interesting observations on the price movements of Bitcoin lately though. He noticed that the price trends of the leading crypto by market cap have started swaying away from its mere reliance on Bitcoin miners and whales to moving in tandem with US stocks. Kim said the new dynamics were seemingly unlocked by the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US. Its entry into the new segment of the market in January has allowed it to be traded similarly to other ETFs and stocks wherein it has since shown deviation from its dependence on bad news regarding “interest rates, pandemics, policies, and wars.” The new mechanics have resulted in both traditional traders and bots buying and selling Bitcoin in the market based on stock market trends. Should this become the new standard, it may definitely change the way we see and trade BTC in the future. So far, Bitcoin has done a great job in its purpose as a hedge. This can be demonstrated by its capacity to log all-new highs at every halving since its inception. It only goes on to show that the real beauty of BTC is not in its short-term price fluctuations but rather in its long-term price appreciation. The next halving cycle will unlikely be any different, especially now that it is experiencing unprecedented institutional adoption."
2024-04-15 02:51:09+00:00,Bitcoin Sunk Over 8% Amid Ongoing Tensions In The Middle East,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-sunk-over-8-amid-ongoing-tensions-in-the-middle-east/,"The recent attack of Iran on Israel just brought about an all-new level of tension in the Middle East. With “World War 3” trending on X (formerly Twitter) and becoming the talk in newsrooms and other social media circles, Bitcoin lost its foothold above the $70,000 line and tumbled below the $62,000 range on Saturday. This is all happening less than a week before the prime cryptocurrency’s fourth halving. This resulted in the price of Bitcoin fluctuating between the $62,000 and $65,000 mark during the weekend. As of this writing at 2:00 AM UTC on Monday, BTC is now trading at $65,300, which shows over a 2% recovery in the 24-hour chart but is 5% short in the seven-day period. Likewise, the digital asset has lost greater than 8% in the monthly frame, dragging along mainstream altcoins with it. On the bright side, it’s still 114% up across the one-year span. Bitcoin is about to enter its fourth halving cycle at its 840,000th block height. With only 722 blocks remaining at this moment, the predicted date of the event is this coming Saturday, April 20. Halving is a pre-programmed deflationary mechanism of Bitcoin that occurs every 210,000 blocks mined. As its name hints, it cuts its blockchain’s block reward by half, which brings the present 6.25 BTC per block reward to 3.125 BTC past the halving this week. With the growing institutional adoption of the digital currency — thanks to the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US last January, the aggressive accumulation of financial institutions of the virtual asset, and the impending entry of giant Chinese financial entities in its ecosystem — there’s optimism that Bitcoin may fly to new heights months after the halving, following the expected “sell the news” event taking place by the coming weekend. Iran rained down a barrage of attack drones and missiles toward Israel on Saturday. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari estimated over 200 drones as well as cruise and ballistic missiles during the incident. The attack came as a response to the Israeli airstrike that targeted a building near the Iranian Embassy in Damascus, Syria, at the start of the month. This reportedly led to the death of Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who was the top military asset of Iran as he commanded the country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force in both Syria and Lebanon. Despite the propensity of Iran’s military response, most of the attacks were intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system."

This could cause prices to explode at the end of the short-term trend. Meanwhile, the blow-off top where the prices will squeeze significantly would be determined by the ascending triangle pattern that formed up in the one-year chart during the present consolidation phase that we are witnessing. At current prices, the trend might lead to $83K next week. The numbers are a major pump from the current all-time high of BTC at $73,750.07 achieved exactly a month ago. The analyst added there’s a strong possibility that it has enough fuel to propel Bitcoin to the moon at $100K or even more. However, he warned that once Bitcoin has exhausted its momentum at the blow-off top, the aftermath could result in a big correction all the way down to $50K. The timeframe for this series of events will likely coincide with the halving happening around April 20. Should all these materialize and Bitcoin dips significantly as predicted, The Moon said the ensuing scenario might serve as a launchpad for the world’s leading cryptocurrency by market cap to sustainably soar to a new price discovery. Brian Quinlivan of the Santiment Network somehow reflected the same positive outlook for Bitcoin. According to him, the ongoing diververge of the digital asset from the S&P 500 index may establish the same historic bullish signal it exhibited in the past. The expert explained that based on his observation, Bitcoin tended to have one of its longest bull runs whenever it deviated from the S&P 500. And this time, the price movements of the digital asset could touch the $80K to $100K territories. With the Bitcoin halving only less than a week away, the prime crypto continues to show strong resistance at the $72K line. As of this writing at 10:30 AM UTC on Saturday, BTC has dunked to $67,400 with over 4% loss in its value in the 24-hour frame, a decrease of 0.68% in the weekly range, and more than 8% loss in the one-month bracket. Nevertheless, it remains around 122% up over the one-year period."
2024-04-12 11:26:47+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Ranges Near All-Time Highs As President Joe Biden Confirms Delay In Rate Cuts,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-ranges-near-all-time-highs-as-president-biden-confirms-delay-in-rate-cuts/,"Last week Bitcoin price on the 4-hour chart showed some indecisiveness and was hurdled between the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average. If the bears won the tug, the price of Bitcoin would drop below the 200-day SMA support, ushering in an extended bear market. However, the bullish momentum superseded the bears and BTC price surged 7.87% to hit a high of $72,756. Several factors including the nearing Bitcoin halving event, and the looming supply shock on exchanges may have contributed to the price increase. Bitcoin price is looking extremely bullish with the 50-day and 200-day SMAs providing strong support underneath. Some key support levels to watch out for include $65,481, $61,603, and $58,696. If BTC price breaks below the 50 and 200-day SMA supports, these levels would provide additional support to the price action. On the positive side, the buy-the-rumor event surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin halving may cause BTC to surge even higher, Some key resistance points to look for include $72,226, $75,173, and $79,071.  President Biden confirmed that according to the CPI data for US inflation, the much-anticipated rate cuts could be delayed further. The interest rates have been rising since the Covid-19 pandemic and hit an all-time high of over 5%.

2024-04-11 18:39:40+00:00,Ordz Games Unveils A Handheld Gaming Console With P2E Feature For Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/ordz-games-unveils-handheld-console-with-p2e-for-bitcoin/,"Ordz Games, a retro-gaming platform, just revealed its plan to release a handheld console that will let users earn Bitcoin as they play games during the Hong Kong Web3 Gaming Expo on April 5. The new device will be called BitBoy One. BREAKING: We have just mined the 6th largest block ever!Meet the on-chain version of @BitBoyOne:🎮 1-to-1 representation by 3D animation🟧 6th largest inscription EVER✴️ largest inscription EVER on a block 9 sat🕹️ GameFi utility (coming)⚙️ DEPIN utility (coming)Welcome… https://t.co/JveXXFUQND Those familiar with old handheld gaming consoles may get a bit of nostalgia with the BitBoy One because of its resemblance to the Nintendo Gameboy released in 1989. However, Ordz Games has taken some liberties with its design to give it an orange see-through shell replicating the popular logo of Bitcoin. According to its maker, BitBoy One doubles as a cryptocurrency miner and a wallet with Xverse and Unisat support, too. It comes with the RockChip RK3566 processor introduced in 2020 for Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) devices and e-link tablets like the Lenovo Smart Paper. The portable console is also fitted with a 3.45-inch 640×480 screen to provide a pretty decent resolution for 3D retro games. Other features include a 32GB internal memory, 256GB TransFlash (TF) storage card, and 4GB RAM. Meanwhile, it is capable of lasting up to six hours with its 3,500 mAh battery at full charge. Don’t expect too much when it comes to game choices though because its emulator can only run up to Playstation 1 titles. But then again, it’s the games supported by Ordz Games that will truly matter here because players can earn Bitcoin from them. The off-chain emulation platform of the developer allows tracking of the players’ progress and it is synced with the cloud whenever online so the corresponding rewards in tokens or NFTs can be claimed. There’s no official timeframe for the release of the BitBoy and its pricing is yet to be announced. However, it’s hinted to be around $500. Some things aren’t clear about the type of rewards the handheld console will offer players also. Our bet is that they could come in BRC-20 tokens or Ordinals based on the Bitcoin blockchain. BitBoy One’s pseudonymous developer, z3th, admitted that the mining power of the device is “very, very weak.” In fact, if one uses it solely for Bitcoin mining, it could take years to do so. Nevertheless, the person behind the portable console ensured it would be fun to play its selection of games. “This device is very deeply rooted inside of Bitcoin,” z3th described their creation. “So the whole design language, the naming, is Bitcoin.” “It’s all going to come with a 3D rendering of the physical device, which will be in an ordinal,” the developer added. Don’t mean to brag or anything but we do have the hottest booth at all of @ParisBlockWeek Bitcoin Gaming is the new meta. pic.twitter.com/0R1XtKzg4x"
2024-04-11 13:06:58+00:00,BTC Is Now Trading Like Stocks Thanks To The Spot Bitcoin ETFs,https://blockzeit.com/btc-is-now-trading-like-stocks-thanks-to-the-spot-bitcoin-etfs/,"Gone were the days when Bitcoin traversed its own direction. Thanks to the approval of spot ETFs based on the digital asset, it is now moving in tandem with stocks and even traders as well as bots are viewing it as such. According to the interview of Korbit Research Center head Kim Min-Seung with KyunHyang Games, US stock traders already have a major influence on the price movements of Bitcoin. The analyst said that the price trends of the leading cryptocurrency by market cap are no longer just confined to the BTC miners and whales. Kim attributed the key shift to the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 11. For him, the new dynamics of the digital asset have become more stock-centric as it moves in tandem with other spot ETFs in the US. The Korbit official also noted that BTC appears to be deviating from its mere reliance to “macro market factors” such as “interest rates, pandemics, policies, and wars.” In the past couple of months, the crypto has tended to follow trends in spot Bitcoin ETFs and the stock market. The significant rise and fall in BTC’s prices has aligned with the market hours of the US stock exchange. Even crypto trading bots have adopted the same buying and selling patterns. Furthermore, Bitcoin and other crypto futures markets have started exhibiting the same behavior, which has led to long and short liquidations. Like most analysts, Kim is bullish on the increase of institutions adopting Bitcoin. However, he explained that retail investors still dominate the BTC market in South Korea. Although institutional investors in the country have begun showing interest in the digital currency, he stated that he has yet to see their entry into the crypto market. At present, the Asian country has an ongoing ban on the institutional ownership of crypto, which prevents asset managers, banks, and other similar entities from entering the Bitcoin ETF market. Kim believes the factors mentioned, coupled with the Bitcoin halving coming around April 20, will likely “create synergies to increase Bitcoin prices.” The 22nd general election in South Korea on April 10 resulted in a decisive victory for the opposition, the Democratic Party (DP). One of the major promises of the party is an overhaul of the country’s cryptocurrency regulations to appeal to the younger and tech-savvy voters. Even the ruling party, the People Power Party (PPP), vowed to do the same. So, with the elections over, it’s time to get back on the promises of the politicians making up the major parties of South Korea’s legislature."

One of the major factors influencing this trend is the unprecedented success of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. Since their approval and subsequent launch on January 11, 2024, the issuers of these new financial instruments have already raked in 842,897 BTC as of yesterday’s report, which should be worth over $58.12 billion in today’s rates at around $69,000 per BTC. This notably makes up over 4% of Bitcoin’s 21 million supply limit. Combined with the upcoming halving that’s set to trigger an all-new height of scarcity for the world’s leading crypto asset by market cap, it would be interesting to know how ordinary consumers are well aware of its worth and potential to shape the future of finance. With that, Deutsche Bank recently conducted a survey to determine the adoption and awareness of people in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Out of the 3,600 participants in the survey, 52% said Bitcoin and cryptos are an important asset class. They believe these will eventually dominate transactions in the future. According to the study, the numbers are a major leap from last year’s results, which showed that below 40% of the participants saw value in these digital assets. Despite the significant developments in people’s outlook toward Bitcoin this year, only 10% believe it could pass the $75,000 mark by the end of 2024. Some bearish sentiments expect the digital currency to tank to $20,000 by year-end. It should be noted though that Bitcoin started below $20,000 last year and it only reclaimed the $40,000 territory by December as anticipation for the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US heated up. This could have heavily affected the lower turnaround of Bitcoin believers. In that case, the 40% approval last year could be seen as a virtually favorable score. By the first quarter of 2024, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs built momentum for BTC up to its climb to a series of new all-time highs, peaking at $73,750.07 on March 14. Finance experts are bullish on the prospect of Bitcoin’s rise to over $100,000 by the end of the year and even $200,000 by 2025. Interestingly, 1% of those surveyed still consider cryptocurrencies as nothing but a fad that will lose their shine in the long run."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2024-04-10 10:41:57+00:00,Michael Saylor’s Vision Of MicroStrategy And Bitcoin – An In-Depth Analysis,https://blockzeit.com/michael-saylors-vision-of-microstrategy-and-bitcoin-an-in-depth-analysis/,"MicroStrategy, a leader in the business intelligence industry, has made a splash in recent years with its decisive investment strategy in Bitcoin. Under the leadership of CEO Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has made Bitcoin a central part of its financial strategy. This article examines the background, motives and potential impact of this decision. Born and raised in an environment characterized by military discipline and technological fascination, Michael Saylor developed an early interest in science and technology. His childhood, spent on air force bases, nurtured his dream of one day conquering the skies as an astronaut or fighter pilot. These dreams led him to the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he studied on an ROTC (Reserve Officers’ Training Corps) scholarship. Saylor graduated from MIT with honors, earning a dual degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics and in Science, Technology and Society. After graduation, Saylor faced unexpected health challenges that drastically changed his career plans. A misdiagnosed heart condition prevented him from joining the Air Force, causing him to reevaluate his career path. He turned to the technology industry and took a job at DuPont, where he gained valuable experience in developing computer simulations. This time was formative for Saylor and laid the foundation for his entrepreneurial future. With a combination of technical know-how and unwavering entrepreneurial spirit, Saylor eventually founded MicroStrategy, a company specializing in business intelligence, mobile software and cloud services. The company’s early years were characterized by rapid growth and notable successes, including a successful IPO. However, MicroStrategy and Saylor itself were not spared challenges; in particular, the dotcom bubble and its aftermath tested the company’s resilience and adaptability. Despite the ups and downs, Saylor remained a tireless advocate of technological innovation. His discovery and subsequent enthusiasm for Bitcoin marked a turning point in both his personal and corporate career. Saylor saw Bitcoin as more than just a digital currency; he recognized a revolutionary technology that had the potential to transform finance and beyond. His passion for Bitcoin and his belief in its importance led MicroStrategy to pursue an aggressive investment strategy in Bitcoin. Saylor’s dedication to Bitcoin and his ability to make complex concepts accessible have made him one of the cryptocurrency’s most prominent advocates. His vision extends far beyond financial gains; he sees Bitcoin as a tool to promote freedom, justice and equality worldwide. With MicroStrategy at the forefront of the digital asset movement, Saylor remains a key figure in the debate about the future of money and property in the digital age. Michael Saylor exemplifies the intersection of technology and finance, where innovation can shape not only the market but also social values. His journey from the Air Force bases to the lecture halls of MIT to the vanguard of blockchain technology reflects a deep commitment to progress and an unwavering belief in the power of technology to change the world for the better. MicroStrategy, a company specializing in business intelligence, mobile software and cloud-based services, was facing a major shift in its corporate strategy. With a solid foundation in technology and a steady eye on forward-looking investments, the company began to evaluate the potential of Bitcoin as part of its financial strategy. In 2020, MicroStrategy made headlines with the announcement that it had invested a significant portion of its cash reserves in Bitcoin. This decision was not impulsive, but the result of in-depth analysis and consideration of Bitcoin’s long-term value stability and potential as an investment. The move reflected a deep conviction in the digital currency as a hedge against inflation and a new paradigm for finance. The decision in favor of Bitcoin was based on several key factors: At a time when traditional currencies are vulnerable to inflation due to expansionary monetary policy measures by central banks, Bitcoin offered an attractive alternative. Its limited availability, similar to gold, promised a stability of value that traditional fiat money could not guarantee. Bitcoin’s historical performance indicated significant appreciation potential. MicroStrategy recognized that an early investment in Bitcoin could not only protect the company’s assets from inflation, but also generate significant capital gains. As a company at the forefront of technological innovation, MicroStrategy recognized Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology as a revolutionary change in the way financial transactions and assets are handled. MicroStrategy initiated its Bitcoin investment with a purchase of 21,454 Bitcoins in August 2020 at an average price of approximately $11,654, for which it spent approximately $250 million. And an additional purchase of 16,796 BTC at an average price of around USD 10,422 in September 2020, representing a further investment of USD 175 million. This initial investment was just the beginning of a series of purchases the company made in the following months, using additional cash reserves and even borrowing to increase its Bitcoin holdings. For MicroStrategy, the move into Bitcoin was more than just a short-term speculation; it was a long-term commitment to an asset class that the company believed was fundamental to the future financial system. The decision was made with a clear vision: To establish Bitcoin as a central part of the company’s strategy to ensure financial strength, stability and growth. MicroStrategy’s decision to invest in Bitcoin marked a turning point not only for the company itself, but also for the perception of crypto-assets in the business world. By investing significantly in Bitcoin, MicroStrategy sent a strong signal about confidence in digital money and its role as a viable investment and hedge against traditional financial uncertainties. MicroStrategy’s decision to invest a substantial portion of its assets in Bitcoin was not based on a spontaneous enthusiasm for crypto-assets, but on an in-depth strategic analysis. This analysis included looking at Bitcoin as a technological innovation as well as its characteristics as an asset. MicroStrategy recognized Bitcoin as a disruptive technological force that has the potential to fundamentally change the way financial transactions are conducted. The blockchain technology on which Bitcoin is based provides a decentralized, transparent and secure method for transactions and was seen as a significant advancement in the field of financial technology. Bitcoin’s unique characteristics, particularly its limited availability and independence from traditional financial systems, made it an attractive asset for MicroStrategy. The company viewed Bitcoin as a form of “digital gold” that not only serves as a hedge against inflation, but also offers the potential for significant appreciation. MicroStrategy’s decision to invest in Bitcoin was based on several key considerations: At a time when central banks’ monetary policies carry the risk of increased inflation, Bitcoin presented itself to MicroStrategy as an attractive alternative to traditional stores of value, such as gold. This offered the company an effective hedge against monetary inflation. By integrating Bitcoin into its portfolio, MicroStrategy aimed to diversify its assets. This strategic decision aimed to minimize risk and strengthen the company’s financial stability. In addition, MicroStrategy identified Bitcoin as an investment opportunity with significant growth potential, driven by its impressive historical performance. The growing acceptance of Bitcoin, both as an asset class and as a means of payment, also promised significant value appreciation in the future. MicroStrategy implemented its Bitcoin investment strategy by gradually buying Bitcoin through the market. This approach allowed the company to strategically build its position in Bitcoin without overly influencing the market. In addition to the initial purchases, the company utilized various funding mechanisms, including the issuance of corporate bonds, to generate further funds for Bitcoin purchases. Investing in Bitcoin was part of a long-term vision for MicroStrategy based on the belief that Bitcoin will play a central role in the future financial ecosystem. This vision includes the expectation that Bitcoin will serve not only as a store of value, but also as a viable alternative to traditional currencies for a wide range of transactions. MicroStrategy’s strategic decision to invest in Bitcoin reflects a comprehensive view of Bitcoin as both a technological innovation and a promising asset. Through careful planning and strategic execution, MicroStrategy positioned itself as a pioneer among companies investing in crypto-assets and demonstrated a strong confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential.

The company’s share price, which was relatively stable prior to the announcement, saw a sharp increase. This reflects the growing interest and acceptance from investors regarding the integration of Bitcoin into the company’s strategy. The positive market reaction also underscored the perception of Bitcoin as a valuable asset and MicroStrategy’s pioneering role in this new investment approach. MSTR share price before and after first Bitcoin purchase in 2020 (Source: Tradingview) MicroStrategy’s decision to invest in Bitcoin not only had an impact on its share price, but also on its market positioning. The company quickly became recognized as one of the first major publicly traded companies to adopt Bitcoin as an integral part of its treasury strategy. This positioning attracted the attention of crypto enthusiasts and traditional investors alike and fostered a new level of credibility and interest in the broader financial community. The decision to allocate a significant portion of the company’s assets to Bitcoin brought a new level of volatility to MicroStrategy’s balance sheet. Bitcoin is known for its price volatility, which is significantly higher than that of traditional asset classes. This volatility presented MicroStrategy with new risk management challenges. The company had to develop strategies to mitigate the impact of Bitcoin price volatility on its financial position and operational performance. Read also: MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor believes Bitcoin’s volatility is one of its most important characteristics Investor reaction to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investment strategy has been mixed. Some investors and analysts praised the company’s visionary stance and its willingness to invest in a new asset class. Others expressed concerns about the risk profile and the impact of Bitcoin volatility on the company’s long-term financial stability. Despite these mixed reactions, MicroStrategy’s decision to communicate transparently about its Bitcoin strategy and provide regular updates helped to build trust and understanding among its stakeholders. The financial and market impact of MicroStrategy’s decision to invest in Bitcoin has been far-reaching. The significant stock market reaction to this announcement underscores the growing interest in the intersection between traditional financial markets and the cryptocurrency world. At the same time, the integration of a volatile asset class such as Bitcoin into the corporate strategy presented MicroStrategy with new risk management challenges. Despite the inherent risks and initial mixed reactions from investors, MicroStrategy’s pioneering work in Bitcoin investing has put the company in a unique position in the financial market and could open up new opportunities for growth and innovation in the long term. MicroStrategy’s commitment to Bitcoin reflects a clear vision for the future in which Bitcoin is seen not only as an investment, but also as a fundamental building block of a new financial paradigm. The company views its Bitcoin investment as a long-term commitment and plans to retain and potentially grow its holdings in the cryptocurrency. This stance is based on the belief that Bitcoin’s value as “digital gold” will increase over time, supported by its scarcity and increasing acceptance as a means of payment and store of value. MicroStrategy has signaled that it is open to diversifying its investment strategy, with Bitcoin at the center. While Bitcoin is at the core of the company’s crypto strategy, the future could include additional investments in other crypto assets or blockchain-based technologies if they offer the potential for similar value appreciation and strategic benefits. The company is always looking for opportunities to strengthen its market position and explore innovative ways to increase shareholder value. MicroStrategy has already utilized innovative financing methods to increase its Bitcoin holdings, including the issuance of convertible notes. This strategy could be further developed in the future to generate additional capital for Bitcoin purchases or other investments. By utilizing low-interest debt instruments, the company is demonstrating its ability to adapt traditional financing methods to support its vision. The integration of Bitcoin into the company’s strategy could also bring long-term changes to MicroStrategy’s core business model. Although the main business is the provision of business intelligence solutions, the increasing acceptance and integration of crypto assets could open up new business areas. This could include the development of new products and services based on blockchain technology, providing additional revenue streams for the company. MicroStrategy has taken an active role in promoting the adoption of Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Through public appearances, educational initiatives, and participation in crypto and financial conferences, the company is helping to increase awareness and understanding of the benefits of crypto assets. These efforts are part of a larger vision in which Bitcoin plays a central role in the global economy, complementing or even transforming traditional financial systems. MicroStrategy’s vision for the future of Bitcoin is ambitious and forward-thinking. By continually investing in Bitcoin and potentially other crypto-assets, innovating the use of financial instruments and actively promoting crypto-adoption, MicroStrategy is positioning itself as a pioneer in a new financial era. The decision to place Bitcoin at the center of its strategy reflects not only a commitment to the cryptocurrency itself, but also a belief in a future economy increasingly based on digital currencies and blockchain technologies. The future of Bitcoin is the subject of intense debate among experts and analysts, with predictions covering a wide range of scenarios. From continued growth in value to wider institutional adoption, many indicators suggest that Bitcoin could further cement its place as a fixture in the global financial system. The limited availability of Bitcoin, coupled with increasing interest from both retail and institutional investors, underpins the forecast of long-term value growth. Forecasts ranging from a doubling to a multiple of the current value in the coming years reflect the optimistic view of many market participants on the future of Bitcoin. The ecosystem surrounding Bitcoin is constantly evolving and becoming increasingly mature. Innovations in blockchain technology, the emergence of new financial products such as Bitcoin ETFs and the increasing integration of Bitcoin into payment systems are just a few examples of this development. In addition, educational initiatives and improving ease of use are helping to lower the barriers to entry into the crypto market and encourage wider adoption among consumers and businesses. MicroStrategy has positioned itself as a key player in the ecosystem through its early and significant investment in Bitcoin. The company will likely continue to be at the forefront of Bitcoin adoption and utilization, particularly with respect to the use of Bitcoin as a primary reserve asset. In addition, MicroStrategy could play an important role in the development of new business models and services based on blockchain technology, further advancing the use of Bitcoin in various sectors of the economy. The increasing adoption of Bitcoin could have a significant impact on traditional financial systems, including how businesses manage their assets, how transactions are conducted and how assets are stored. While some argue that Bitcoin will complement existing currencies and financial products, others see Bitcoin as a potential challenge to traditional financial institutions and currencies. In the long term, this could lead to a reassessment of the role of central banks and the importance of fiat currencies. The regulatory landscape for Bitcoin and other crypto-assets remains a critical factor for the future development of the ecosystem. While some countries have created a regulatory framework that encourages the use and trading of crypto assets, other regulatory changes are yet to come. Developing balanced regulation that both encourages innovation and ensures consumer protection will be critical to the sustainable integration of Bitcoin into the global financial system. The future of Bitcoin and its impact on the global financial system is the subject of intense debate and speculation. While the exact evolution of Bitcoin and the surrounding ecosystem remains uncertain, many signs point to increasing adoption and integration into traditional financial markets. MicroStrategy, as an early proponent and investor in Bitcoin, is likely to play a key role in this process and could benefit significantly from long-term developments. Continually monitoring the regulatory landscape and adapting to changing market conditions will be critical to fully capitalize on the opportunities that Bitcoin offers. MicroStrategy’s strategic decision to invest heavily in Bitcoin underlines a visionary attitude towards the digital currency and its role in the future financial system. This decision, driven by the realization of Bitcoin’s potential as “digital gold” and a hedge against inflationary risks, has not only transformed MicroStrategy’s financial structure, but also its positioning in the market. The market impact of the Bitcoin investment is clearly reflected in the performance of MicroStrategy’s share price, which has seen significant movements in response to the company’s crypto strategy. This highlights the close link between MicroStrategy’s enterprise value and Bitcoin’s volatility, creating new challenges but also opportunities for risk management and strategic planning. MicroStrategy’s long-term vision and future plans for Bitcoin reinforce the belief that crypto-assets will play an essential role in the financial world. By continuing to invest in Bitcoin and potentially diversifying into other crypto-assets or blockchain technologies, MicroStrategy is positioning itself as a leader at the intersection of traditional financial markets and the digital economy. The future development of the Bitcoin ecosystem and its integration into the global financial system remains dynamic and uncertain. However, MicroStrategy has made it clear that it is prepared to play an active role in this evolution, not only as an investor, but also as an innovator and promoter of crypto adoption. Continually monitoring the regulatory landscape and adapting to market changes will be critical to fully capitalize on the opportunities presented by the crypto revolution. MicroStrategy’s decision to invest so heavily in Bitcoin could serve as a catalyst for similar moves by other firms, paving the way for broader institutional adoption of crypto assets. The long-term impact of this strategy on the financial system, on traditional and digital assets, and on the role of companies like MicroStrategy in the new economic order will be the subject of ongoing monitoring and analysis.

Although the former has dominated the inflows in most instances, there have been several days wherein the latter has outperformed it. Just three months following the approval of the investment powerhouse’s spot Bitcoin ETF, otherwise known as Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund with ticker FBTC, it has grown its holdings to 150,650.94 BTC based on its financial disclosure dated April 9, 2024. At the time of its filing to the SEC, this amounted to $10,811,222,229.51 at $71,763.39 per BTC. The spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have shown unprecedented success since their launch. Save for Grayscale’s GBTC fund which has undergone massive outflows following its reclassification, the other nine have been on a roll and have already accumulated over 520,000 BTC. That’s worth around $36.4 billion at $70K per BTC. Fidelity’s FBTC sits second on the rankings of the nine newly-created spot Bitcoin ETFs when it comes to assets under management (AUM) with its abovementioned BTC supply. Leading the charge is BlackRock’s IBIT with 263,937 BTC in AUM worth $18.475 billion while Ark Invest’s ARKB is positioned third with 43,726 BTC in AUM worth $3.06 billion according to Coinglass. On the other hand, GBTC has shed nearly half of its BTC holdings since its conversion to a spot Bitcoin ETF. From 619,220 BTC in AUM three months ago, it has now declined to 322,697 BTC. Nevertheless, its digital treasure trove is still higher than BlackRock at $22.59 billion. Combining all the BTC held by the spot Bitcoin ETF issuers in the US alone makes up more than 4% or around 842,897 of the top crypto asset’s 21 million supply cap. As of this writing at 1:00 PM UTC on Tuesday, Bitcoin is trading at $70,800, displaying a slump of around 2% in the 24-hour chart. Within the period, the digital currency experienced only a 0.12% increase in transaction volume as $33.46 billion worth of BTC moved between addresses. Meanwhile, the market cap of its 19.67 million circulating supply slid to $1.39 trillion. The same span saw the largest crypto asset by total valuation journey between a $69,654.16 low and a $72,285.73 high. So far, it remains 4% away from its latest all-time high of $73,750.07 achieved on March 14 this year."
2024-04-08 12:20:35+00:00,China’s Big Fund Managers Are Jumping On The Spot Bitcoin ETFs Bandwagon,https://blockzeit.com/chn-big-fund-managers-jump-on-spot-bitcoin-etfs-bandwagon/,"In yet another win for the cryptocurrency community, China’s financial powerhouses, Harvest Fund and Southern Fund, have filed their applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong through their subsidiaries within the jurisdiction. This surely comes as big news to the industry because the two are considered to be among the largest asset managers in China, and due to the fact that they originate from a country that has shown hostility toward Bitcoin over the past couple of years. JUST IN: 🇨🇳 $284 billion China Southern Fund has reportedly applied to launch spot #Bitcoin ETF via Hong Kong.You can't stop an idea whose time has come 🙌 pic.twitter.com/rnHOuRoY7V According to Bitcoin Magazine, Harvest Fund possesses more than $230 in assets under AUM while Southern Fund holds over $280 billion AUM. Although these are not as big as the likes of Wall Street heavyweights BlackRock and Fidelity, the event further displays the growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin and it hints at a softening stance of one of the world’s largest economies toward the leading cryptocurrency by market cap. The verdict for all pending spot Bitcoin ETF applications in Hong Kong is expected to arrive as early as the second quarter of 2024. Their approval is not set in stone but analysts are optimistic about their prospects, especially with the success their Western counterparts have exhibited since they were greenlit by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 11. So far, the biggest player in the US spot Bitcoin ETF market remains to be BlackRock. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has already processed over $13.5 billion inflows in the first 11 weeks of its trading alone. Make no mistake, Bitcoin is still banned in mainland China and strict controls are applied on the movement of capital across borders. Despite this, the cryptocurrency sector somehow operates within a grey area in the giant Asian nation because people are able to trade the digital asset as well as other tokens on crypto exchanges like Binance and OKX based on a report by Reuters. Other registered over-the-counter channels are also available to process crypto transactions. Meanwhile, China-based investors have found a way to acquire digital currencies through overseas bank accounts. In the case of Hong Kong, China has always been behind its move to become a crypto hub with its silent blessing."
2024-04-08 09:09:10+00:00,Bitcoin Mining Firm Hut 8 Contacted By Wall Street Banks Wanting To Buy Their BTC,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-mining-firm-hut-8-contacted-by-banks-wanting-to-buy-btc/,"A sign of a major supply shortage for Bitcoin is brewing, and this is now causing major banks to go on a buying spree. Some of them are even directly contacting Bitcoin mining firms to ensure they get a jump on the competition. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot revealed to DLNews that they have recently been called up by several Wall Street banks to buy BTC directly from them. However, the Bitcoin mining firm boss refused to name any of the purported buyers and only referred to them as “the largest banks you can think of.” “We’ve had banks reach out to us to try to buy our Bitcoin because of the supply shortages on these different exchanges,” said Genoot without identifying the crypto exchanges he was pointing at. The Hut 8 supremo is also super bullish on the upcoming halving of the Bitcoin ecosystem that’s set to cut down BTC rewards per block mined in the world’s leading blockchain from the present 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC. He believes the ensuing reduction of mining rewards will further tighten the supply of BTC in the months to come. “The supply coming down by 50%, from 900 Bitcoin to 450 Bitcoin per day, also makes a big impact, because now you have increasing demand but less supply,” added the Bitcoin mining company’s head.“It’s a double whammy in terms of pushing Bitcoin’s price up.” Hut 8 is one of the leading Bitcoin mining companies in North America. As of March, it has grown its deployed miners under management to around 76,800 with a hashrate under management of 8.7 exahashes per second (EH/s) according to its latest press release. The boost in the Bitcoin mining production of Hut 8 was a result of its ongoing restructuring efforts. This saw the company close its Drumheller rigs to relocate to Medicine Hat. It also resulted in the closure of other inefficient mining units to focus more on its new Salt Creek site. Meanwhile, it presently holds 9,102 BTC on its balance sheet, which is worth around $646.24 million based on Bitcoin’s prevailing value of $71,000 as of this writing at 8:50 AM UTC on Monday."
2024-04-07 02:48:47+00:00,Election Strategy: South Korean Party Vows to Provide Access to Bitcoin ETFs,https://blockzeit.com/south-korean-party-vows-to-provide-access-to-bitcoin-etfs/,"The South Korean parliamentary elections slated for April 10 have revealed the growing interest in crypto asset investment in the country as the two major parties, the PPP (People Power Party) and the DPK (Democratic Party of Korea) have deployed crypto-friendly promises to appeal to and gather the votes of the crypto-savvy population.  While the PPP assures South Koreans it will push for the delay in taxation of crypto investment gains for an additional two years, its left-wing counterpart proposes access to US spot Bitcoin ETFs. The success of the spot bitcoin ETFs has not only shaken the US but has also attained the status of an election strategy in the South Korean landscape. A local news outlet reported back in February that the Democratic Party of Korea sought to allow the trading of Bitcoin Spot ETFs banned in the country as part of their plans to attract more votes in the impending general election. Shortly after the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, the South Korean financial regulator the FSC (Financial Services Commission) declared it illegal to broker any “overseas-listed” spot Bitcoin ETF as doing so “may violate the existing government stance on virtual assets and the Capital Markets Act.” The ruling party the PPP had earlier promised to ease the cryptocurrency restrictions in the country but fell short due to its inability to carry along the relevant government and financial agencies to ease up the tight cryptocurrency policies. Exploiting the PPP’s failure to amend the cryptocurrency policies, the Democratic Party of South Korea led by Lee Jae-myung plans to institutionalize virtual assets and revitalize investment by working with the FSC to review the Capital Markets Act.  According to South Korea’s Capital Markets Act, Bitcoin isn’t considered an “underlying asset”, which automatically rules out the possibility of spot ETF investment in the country. However, the Democratic Party is keen on discussing ways to revise the Capital Markets Act with the ruling party if the FSC rejects their proposition again. Additionally, the Democratic Party intends to reduce capital gain taxation on crypto asset trading by increasing the threshold amount for tax deduction from the present 2.5 million won to 50 million won in 2025.  In the rumble for voters in the April 10 general elections, South Korea’s People Power Party has proposed a two-year tax break for crypto assets. According to the party, “the tax base has not been established right now” and “there is a need for at least a two-year delay until the amendment is passed and such a system is actually built.” The party believes that an amendment of the country’s Virtual Asset User Protection Act to incorporate the stock exchange and a robust virtual asset proof of income framework will be necessary before taxes are imposed on virtual asset traders.  The ruling party has been subjected to immense pressure as spot Bitcoin ETFs and freer crypto policies seem to be taking the spotlight in South Korea’s power struggle. As the democratic opposition aligns more with the country’s younger and more crypto-savvy generation, there’s likely to be a major power shift after the April 10 legislative elections."
2024-04-06 00:00:00+00:00,"BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF Includes Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Citadel, And UBS As APs",https://blockzeit.com/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-includes-goldman-sachs-citigroup-citadel-ubs-and-others-as-aps/,"The institutional adoption of Bitcoin continues as more titans in the financial sector are now aggressively taking a heavy exposure of the digital asset in their portfolios. Following the unprecedented success of IBIT, big names like Goldman Sachs & Co, Citigroup Global Markets, Citadel Securities, and UBS Securities have triumphantly negotiated their way into becoming APs for BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF. Alongside these popular names was the ABN AMRO clearing house based on the filing of the largest asset manager to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday, April 4. The addition of these five institutions increases the total APs of the BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF to nine. The old ones included Jane Street Capital, JP Morgan Securities, Macquarie Capital, and Virtu Americas. According to BlackRock, an AP is a financial institution that’s essential in creating liquidity for an ETF. It is often a bank that manages the creation and redemption of the supply of shares in the market to bring back stability in times of a shortage or surplus. The process keeps the ETF’s price synchronized with the value of its underlying securities. The inclusion of Goldman Sachs was as surprising as the participation of JP Morgan in the IBIT ecosystem. Barely a week ago, the bank’s chief investment officer under its Wealth Management Unit, Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, was just bashing Bitcoin. The Goldman Sachs exec tore through BTC’s apparent lack of intrinsic value. She told The Wall Street Journal, “We do not think it is an investment asset class.” “We’re not believers in crypto,” she added before the explosive news about their massive Bitcoin exposure via IBIT came. Similarly, JP Morgan, another AP of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, had its CEO Jamie Dimon always lashing out at the largest digital asset by market cap. His latest tirades included a statement saying he would shut down Bitcoin if he were the government because it has been the hotpot of illicit activities such as money laundering over the years. He likewise called people who borrow money to buy BTC “fools.” These somehow echo the same arguments raised by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink when he repeatedly referred to Bitcoin as the “index of money laundering” before making a sharp U-turn when they finally decided to enter the spot Bitcoin ETF market. By far, the solid performance of IBIT has made a believer out of the BlackRock boss as it became the fastest-growing ETF in history, far surpassing his expectations."
2024-04-05 11:31:43+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Is Coiling Around A Dangerous Zone, Death Cross, or New ATH?",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-is-coiling-around-a-dangerous-zone-death-cross-or-new-ath/,"Last Week, the price of Bitcoin rose but encountered resistance around the $70,000 level. The price action formed a double-top pattern, threatening to drop to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA). The 50-day SMA and local support at $68,000 provided rather strong support. However, the double-tp chart pattern morphed into an extended consolidation pattern that ran for 7 days.  On April 2, 2024, Bitcoin price fell 7.77%, breaking below the range and finding support at the 200-day SMA. The price bounced off this indicator but was not able to rise much higher as the overhead support turned resistance at $68,000 proved to be a strong obstacle. Bitcoin is caught between a fork on the road and must decide which direction to take. A break below the 200-day SMA may bring about a death cross. The death cross appears on a chart when the 50-day SMA cross is below its long-term moving average, usually the 200-day SMA. This chart pattern does not augur good news for Bitcoin. For instance, a death cross on the S&P 500 in December of 2018 led to news headlines describing “a stock market in tatters.” If the death cross happens, BTC could drop to as low as $60,000. However, if the 200-day SMA proves strong support, BTC could bounce back to previous all-time highs (ATH), and even establish new ATH prices.

2024-04-04 17:35:29+00:00,Victory For Bitcoin As Louisiana Passes Bill Protecting Fundamental Rights,https://blockzeit.com/victory-for-bitcoin-as-louisiana-passes-bill-protecting-fundamental-rights/,"The US state of Louisiana has passed a bill to protect fundamental Bitcoin rights. The groundbreaking bill, spearheaded by Louisiana House of Representatives member Mark Wright and supported by the Pelican Institute, seeks to offer Louisianians the rights to buy, mine, and self-custody Bitcoin – and will make the state one of the most Bitcoin-friendly states in the US once approved.  The state of Louisiana’s Fundamental Bitcoin Rights Bill received a Unanimous vote of 103-0. In essence, no single member of the state House of Representatives objected to the proposed bill.  In the US legislative system, a bill requires the vote of at least two-thirds of the members of the House to be passed. The absence of opposition in this case hints at Louisiana’s eagerness to spearhead the US Bitcoin revolution. Over the last few years, the Pelican State has been setting the legal framework to fully integrate cryptocurrency into its jurisdiction. In 2022, the state’s former governor John Bel Edwards signed a bill to permit financial institutions and trust companies to store crypto for customers.  This latest bill on Bitcoin Rights, championed by State Representative Mark Wright, was introduced to the house in early March this year. Rep. Wright has been at the forefront of pushing for legislation to establish and adequately regulate the crypto industry in the state.  In 2020, he also championed a bill to regulate and license virtual currency businesses which was later enacted in June 2023. For this latest bill for Bitcoin rights, Wright has enjoyed the support of non-profits like the Satoshi Act Fund and New Orleans-based Pelican Institute.  The bill to protect fundamental Bitcoin rights will give Louisianans the guaranteed right to purchase Bitcoin, the freedom to mine it, and the “right to self-custody of your digital assets” as per Dennis Porter of the Satoshi Act Fund. Porter is the CEO of Satoshi Act Fund – a Bitcoin advocacy non-profit that works with lawmakers and regulators to create policies that favor Bitcoin adoption so all Americans can benefit from the technology. His non-profit also supported Oklahoma’s bill to protect Bitcoin rights which was also a success with an 81-1 vote in the House of Reps. “This legislation represents an opportunity for Louisiana to shine as a beacon of digital liberty and creativity, establishing a strong example for other states to emulate,” wrote Porter on X. “However, success is not guaranteed,” he added. The bill is set to advance into the Senate hearing stage and would only be signed into law if it gains the vote of at least two-thirds of the Senate. Porter has called for community involvement “whether through advocacy or financial support” in this bill which he believes will create history for both Louisiana and the entire Bitcoin community."

Read more here: https://t.co/PaxyhKMZtv pic.twitter.com/MoEENtjElm Coinbase just announced its new strategic partnership centering on the integration of the Lightning Network into its crypto exchange operations. Open-source protocol Lightspark will serve as the technical partner of the exchange to pave the way for faster and very low fees for Bitcoin transactions within the platform. “Coinbase customers will benefit from instant, cheaper transfers, and this integration will pave the way for more collaboration between the companies in the months and years to come,” Lightspark stated in its press release. According to the company helmed by David Marcus as CEO, it took them two years to arrive at a product considered “the best enterprise-grade entry point to the Lightning Network on the market.” They pride themselves on developing software and services anchored on the Lightning Network that’s tailored even to the most demanding institutions but without the complex procedure that comes along with it. The streamlined and smooth implementation and management of Lightning nodes within Coinbase were mainly attributed to the tech firm’s own software development kits (SDKs), application programming interface (API), developer tools, and artificial intelligence-based (AI) smart engine called Lightspark Predict. Early on, former X CEO Jack Dorsey challenged Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong because of the latter’s apparent snub of the capabilities of the Bitcoin Lightning Network. In response, the boss of one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges said they were still looking for the best way to fuse the L2 solution in the platform. Fast-forward to the present, Coinbase has finally found the most ideal way to do it. The Lightning Network is a decentralized layer 2 project scaled on the Bitcoin blockchain. It provides an execution layer that processes transactions outside of the Bitcoin network’s main chain to enable an increased throughput. With its utilization on Coinbase, it will help decongest the overall network usage of Bitcoin while users will be able to do away with the continuously rising layer 1 fees of its transactions. In the long run, Lightspark plans to roll out additional use cases for its software solutions in the payments niche. It is currently developing a way to bridge more liquidity to be converted in and out of BTC from fiat and other cryptocurrencies."
2024-04-03 06:13:29+00:00,US Government Moves $2B Bitcoin To Coinbase,https://blockzeit.com/us-government-moves-2b-bitcoin-to-coinbase/,"A wallet address traced to the US government just moved a massive Bitcoin haul to Coinbase yesterday. According to Arkham Intelligence, the wallet originally belonged to the Silk Road darknet market, which was confiscated by American authorities. The transfer involved 30,174.70 BTC to the tune of $2.1 billion. The digital asset was part of the 50,000 BTC seized by US officials from the Silk Road website in 2022. The recent sale was a follow-up to the 9,861 BTC offered in the market back in March 2023 for $216 million. Although a chain of events was blamed for the dipping price of Bitcoin since the start of April, the BTC unloading of the US government was considered by many analysts as one of the key reasons for the drop. As of this writing at 5:30 AM UTC, Bitcoin has yet to recover the $70K mark it lost since the beginning of the month. It is now trading at $66,000, plunging around 0.70% on the 24-hour chart and 6.20% on the seven-day range. Despite that, zooming out the graphs shows that it’s still up by over 6% on the 30-day bracket and 137% on the one-year frame. The market capitalization of the 19.67 million BTC in circulation right now is approximately $1.30 trillion. Amidst the diving values, it remains 9th among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap as other stocks have also taken a brunt from several macroeconomic factors. As mentioned, the cause of spiraling down prices in Bitcoin is not just confined to the latest BTC sale of the US government. For LMAX group market strategist Joel Kruger, the Bitcoin market has already been long due for a correction after showing an astonishing performance in the first quarter wherein the prime crypto commodity conquered new all-time highs, surpassing the long-time record it held since November 2021. The $73,750.07 price BTC achieved on March 14 this year is the highest so far. Kruger also attributed the recovering economy of the US as the culprit for the shift in sentiment. “Bitcoin doesn’t need much excuse to go through a period of correction after such an explosive performance in Q1,” said Kruger in an interview with CNBC. “Having said that, US economic data has been stronger of late, all while inflation continues to be a concern.” “This has resulted in a repricing of Fed expectations, translating to broad-based U.S. dollar demand on the more attractive US dollar yield differentials,” the analyst added. Another element that added to the woes of the largest cryptocurrency by market cap was the massive sale involving 4,000 BTC on Bitfinex by an unidentified Bitcoin whale and the ensuing series of large liquidations triggered in exchanges."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2024-04-02 17:10:12+00:00,Tumbling Bitcoin And Crypto Prices Liquidate $468 Million Positions,https://blockzeit.com/tumbling-bitcoin-and-crypto-prices-liquidate-468-million-positions/,"Bitcoin just bled red candles today, dragging along the entire cryptocurrency market. The leading crypto asset by market cap slumped from today’s high of $69,889.14 down to a $64,586.59 low, showing a difference of 7.58% or $5,302.55 between the prices. As of this writing at 4:00 PM UTC on Tuesday, it’s still trading at the $64,600 mark with a drop of more than 4% on the 24-hour chart, which may continue to slide further below if it breaches its new critical support this week. Interestingly, the trading volume of the digital asset saw a rise of over 55% as $48.30 billion worth of BTC moved between addresses. Most of these transactions can be attributed to the ensuing series of huge liquidations triggered during the crypto’s dip. Based on Coinglass data, around $467.92 million worth of positions were liquidated in the crypto market from around 139,003 traders in the 24-hour frame. Bitcoin accounted for $155.49 million of these numbers as $107.88 million longs and $47.61 shorts were cleared during the wave. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, recorded $114.77 million in liquidations with $86.96 million longs and $27.81 shorts burned. So almost every time Bitcoin drops, shills like Peter Schiff just never fail to take every chance they can get to spread FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) about it. The economist and Chairman of SchiffGold warned that a larger decline could be on the horizon and Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) holders could be in trouble. #Bitcoin just tanked over $3K in about 10 minutes. That's almost a 4.5% drop. It's equivalent to a $100 drop in the price of #gold in 10 minutes. Gold is actually up a couple of bucks. If this turns into something bigger, ETF investors are trapped until the NYSE opens tomorrow. Previously, Schiff also criticized the preference of young investors for Bitcoin instead of more traditional assets like gold. He said that because of their sheer ignorance and inexperience, they are easily lured by the digital asset’s seeming outperformance of the precious metal. The economist added that eventually they will realize their mistakes and see the true value of gold. The reason young people prefer #Bitcoin to #gold, other than ignorance and lack of experience, is that during their short lifetimes, Bitcoin is up much more than gold. But by the time they gain the wisdom that comes with age, Bitcoin will have collapsed and they will prefer gold. While Schiff has always been biased toward gold and antagonistic toward cryptos, particularly Bitcoin, dismissing his caution outright could prove costly should his prediction take effect. So, a safe bet during this time when extreme greed in the market runs high is for investors to diversify their holdings. However, with the Bitcoin halving inevitably slashing BTC supply after April 20 amid the rising institutional demand for the crypto asset, most analysts are optimistic toward the potential rise of BTC to new heights in a couple of months with even a $200K target set for 2025. With that, exercise due diligence as you weigh your options and risk appetite in these crucial moments."
2024-04-02 02:07:03+00:00,"Larry Fink’s Stance On BTC Improves, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Processes Over $13.5 Billion In 11 Weeks",https://blockzeit.com/blackrocks-bitcoin-etf/,"The CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, Larry Fink of BlackRock, has recently shifted his stance on Bitcoin, following the same trajectory of narrative and sentiment changing over time from other industry leaders. How it started vs how it's going pic.twitter.com/TtGqfmgzdD The turning point for Fink’s stance towards Bitcoin was sparked by the performance of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (ticker IBIT), which already became the fastest-growing ETF in history with the $13.5 billion in flows that occurred during the first 11 weeks of trading. IBIT is the fastest-growing ETF in the history of ETFs. Nothing is gaining assets as fast as IBIT in the history of ETFs A few years ago, Fink described Bitcoin as ‘an Index of Money Laundering’. His dismissive description reflected the strong skepticism towards the king of cryptocurrencies and its ability to attract institutional investors at the time. Just a few years later, Fink is now singing the praises of Bitcoin’s future as a reflection of how the technological revolution is disrupting legacy companies. He notes that it is a clear testament to the ongoing process of institutional acceptance and validation of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. In early March 2024, the American financier told Bloomberg that all signs are pointing to Bitcoin securing its future as one of the most successful assets of the 21st century. Our view of Bitcoin has evolved. Fink’s narrative has evolved in the direction of increasing legitimization, greater understanding of Bitcoin, and gradual integration into traditional finance.  Fink further now believes that Bitcoin is an institutional investment and its market appeal will inevitably grow.  In the past, Bitcoin was heavily associated with illicit activities due to its reliance on decentralization and anonymous nature. The skepticism Fink displayed about Bitcoin (BTC) reflected the skepticism of most traditional investors and financial institutions at the time. Today, Bitcoin has adapted to play by the rules of traditional finance that it once sought to disintermediate.  In light of the changing landscape, Fink is now able to tick all the boxes that make a Bitcoin investment feel ‘very comfortable’. Some of the factors that have changed Fink’s mind on Bitcoin include the exponential Bitcoin market growth, increased market liquidity, and transparency.  He notes that the asset has succeeded in creating and expanding its own market liquidity, which surprised him more than anything else. "
2024-04-01 16:49:10+00:00,"Tether Adds 8,889 Bitcoin In Its Coffers, Growing Its Holdings To Over 75,000 BTC",https://blockzeit.com/tether-adds-8889-bitcoin/,"Although Tether has been hush-hush about its Bitcoin transactions unless it’s already time for their quarterly or annual reports, an on-chain analysis by Arkham Intelligence tracked a whale transaction yesterday involving the company. The analytics firm confirmed that a wallet belonging to the world’s largest stablecoin issuer was a recipient of 8,889 BTC amounting to around $627 million on March 31 via a Bitfinex hot wallet. It’s not exactly known how much Bitcoin Tether actually holds or how much it bought the asset, but it’s estimated to be somewhere north of 75,000 BTC. At prevailing prices, this should be above $5.25 billion. At this rate, Tether appears to be gradually positioning itself as one of the largest Bitcoin whales in the world. Its recent move also reinforces the narrative about BTC being the hardest asset out there, which could serve as an effective hedge against the growing concerns about the potential loss of dominance and further devaluation of the US dollar wherein the USDT is pegged. “The decision to invest in Bitcoin, the world’s first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset,” said CTO Paulo Ardoino in light of Tether’s series of BTC purchases. According to its disclosures, Tether has no plans of halting its Bitcoin hoarding anytime soon. Last year, the company stated that it will continue allotting 15% of its excess profits for BTC accumulation. So far, the firm’s wager seems to have been nothing but very rewarding as its latest attestation report during the last quarter of 2023 revealed that $2.8 billion of its consolidated reserves can be attributed to its Bitcoin investment. With the upcoming halving cutting off the daily rewards of Bitcoin from an average of 900 BTC to 450 BTC per day amid the growing appetite of powerhouse financial institutions for the largest digital asset by market cap, Tether is optimistic that its investment in the prime cryptocurrency will continue to pay off. Besides its foray into USDT and BTC, Tether has also turned its sights on Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) as of late. With less than 19 days to go until the halving, Bitcoin volatility has been very evident. As of this writing at 4:30 PM UTC, the digital currency just retraced its price back to the $68K mark from a $71K peak within the 24-hour chart. Nevertheless, BTC remains ninth among the top 10 assets in the world by market cap with its 19.67 million circulating BTC supply valued at $1.35 trillion. On the other hand, Tether’s market cap currently sits at $104.47 billion."
2024-03-31 15:21:06+00:00,Brace Yourselves For The Upcoming Bitcoin Supply Crunch,https://blockzeit.com/brace-yourselves-for-the-upcoming-bitcoin-supply-crunch/,"With only less than 3,000 blocks to go until the halving triggers at the pre-determined 840,000th block height, the monumental affair in the Bitcoin ecosystem is estimated to take place sometime on April 20 this year. In a nutshell, the event is one of the key deflationary features of BTC that cuts its block rewards at every 210,000 blocks mined in approximately four years. The fourth epoch of the halving is set to cut Bitcoin mining rewards from the existing 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC. To date, there are already 19.67 million BTC in circulation out of its finite supply of 21 million coins. Doing the simple math, that only leaves 1.33 million BTC from today up to the final halving scheduled in 2140. Simply put, a ‘supply crunch’ is a time when the supply of a product is overwhelmed by demand. In the case of Bitcoin, the regulatory approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US has become the key catalyst for its wider institutional adoption. As of the March 29 data, the 10 spot Bitcoin ETF issuers in the US already own 849,276 BTC, equivalent to $59.45 billion based on the prevailing price of the digital asset today. Interestingly, this makes up over 4% of all Bitcoin’s max supply. That is more than 4% of all the Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/BQdQUErDBL This is further magnified by other financial entities that are hell-bent on taking a significant slice of BTC before prices totally blow off the roof like Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy. Notably, the firm that has rebranded itself as a Bitcoin development company already possesses more than 1% of the coins’ overall float with a total supply of 214,246 BTC. At this rate, their accumulation is showing no signs of slowing down, and this could ultimately lead to higher demand as the daily Bitcoin production gets slashed from an average of 900 BTC to post-halving’s 450 BTC amidst the aggressive buying spree of institutional as well as retail investors. BlackRock remains the leader among the spot Bitcoin ETF issuers in the US. According to its public disclosure, it presently holds over 252,000 BTC valued at $17.32 billion. On Friday, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) spot Bitcoin ETF closed at $40.30 per share. It displayed $95.1 million in net inflows during that time amid Grayscale Bitcoin Trust’s (GBTC) 104.9 net outflows that dragged the net inflows of all 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US to $182.8 million. As of this writing at 3:00 PM UTC on Sunday, Bitcoin is trading at $70,000 with a slight nudge of 0.49% in its price. Meanwhile, transaction volume decreased by 11% as only $18.05 billion worth of BTC moved between addresses as prices swung from a $69,601.07 low to a $70,746.34 high."
2024-03-29 12:13:01+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Forms A Double Top As SBF 2-Year Long Case Comes To A Close,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-price-forms-a-double-top-as-sbf-2-year-long-case-comes-to-a-close/,"BTC supply, price, market cap, and dominance are all up this week, signifying that the asset is gaining value against other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin halving is fast approaching, now less than 23 days away and BTC price action is expected to be volatile come April. Last week Bitcoin price on the 4-hour chart was trending below the 50-day moving average but above the $60,000 level. The 200-day moving average provided strong support for the price action. The price of Bitcoin bounced off the 200-day moving average and is now rising higher. Bitcoin is making these volatile moves in the backdrop of Sam Bankman-Fried’s case coming to an end. SBF has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for causing one of the largest financial scandals in crypto history. The ex-founder of FTX Exchange and Alameda single-handedly caused the loss of over $10 billion of customer funds. On the 4-hour chart, BTC is forming a double top, which is not a good sign for investors. Double tops usually indicate the end of the bullish pattern and the start of a bearish one. The asset has several support levels at the 50-day SMA, the 200-day SMA, and the $60,000 level.  If the 50-day moving average support holds water, Bitcoin is expected to move higher and hit the previous all-time high price of $73,000. This level also serves as a resistance for the price action and should BTC overcome it, the price could rise even higher and hit $78,615. This would mark a new all-time high price for the king of cryptocurrencies.

In 2017, he referred to the digital asset as an “index of money laundering.” Back then, Bitcoin was priced below $6,000. “Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world,” said Fink during a meeting at the Institute of International Finance. “That’s all it is.” Fast-forward to today, he is now taking pride in how much the spot Bitcoin ETF of BlackRock, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), is exceeding expectations by a long shot. Since its approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last January 11, it has experienced astonishing inflows, and it is already targeting to match the asset under management (AUM) of its rival, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). “I’m very bullish on the long-term viability of Bitcoin,” Fink told Fox. “That surprised me how much that’s gone up.” “We are creating now a market that has more liquidity, more transparency, and I’m pleasantly surprised and I would have never predicted it before we filed it, that we were going to see this type of retail demand,” he added. Fink seconded the host, Charlie Gasparino, when it was suggested that while he initially thought their spot Bitcoin ETF would “do good,” he never expected to it be “this good.” “IBit ETF is the fastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs.” Fink went on. BREAKING 🚨BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says its Spot Bitcoin ETF is the fastest growing ETF in history and he's very bullish on $BTC long term. pic.twitter.com/0IsoU8yJll Barely three months after its approval, IBIT crossed the $10 billion AUM range on March 1. By far, this was an unprecedented growth, surpassing the record once held by SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which took two years since its launch in 2004 to reach such a mark. IBIT presently possesses over 240,000 BTC, which is more than MicroStrategy’s haul of 214,246 BTC. Overall, BlackRock’s Bitcoin stash represents around 1.22% of the premier cryptocurrency’s 19.67 million circulating supply. Bitcoin appears to be in another consolidation phase as it trades along the $70K psychological threshold. As of this writing at 5:00 AM UTC, BTC is priced at $69,600 with less than 1% drop in the 24-hour frame. However, its trading volume is up by 14% as $41.09 billion worth of BTC moved between addresses. The same period saw Bitcoin swing from a $68,381.93 low to a $71,727.68 high."

There is no denying that in the aftermath of the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) approving Bitcoin ETFs, and the subsequent gold rush to purchase these novel financial products ahead of the fourth Bitcoin halving wherein the miner reward will be cut from 900 bitcoins daily to only 450. It’s truly a turning point for Bitcoin, and quite possibly for the greater crypto industry.  As many suspected, big money and retail investors alike might feel more comfortable holding their Bitcoin in a Bitcoin ETF with all the regulatory assurances that come with it. It’s hard to imagine this trend stopping. The genie has been let out of the proverbial bottle.  And now, with the Bitcoin ETF eating up headlines and causing global FOMO, the SEC must begin to consider whether it will approve or deny an Ether ETF. Undoubtedly, these are transformative times for the crypto sector. The first weeks of the Bitcoin ETF alone saw record inflows to crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs). Combined assets under management (AUM) reached levels last seen during the 2021 bull market top, according to capital market company Coinshares. There was a massive number of inflows for an industry that had been so shunned by its traditional counterparts until now.      Crypto ETPs saw $2.45 billion inflows in the week ending Feb. 16, largely coming from the United States, including the 10 approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock and Fidelity ETFs, which were responsible for almost $2.3 billion of last week’s inflows at $1.6 billion and over $648 million, respectively. Bitwise, Grayscale, ProShares and 21Shares also saw massive inflows.  As a backdrop to this action in the traditional financial markets, the raw Bitcoin price increased  by more than 4% from Monday, Feb.12 to Friday, Feb.16, closing the week at more than $52,000, which is a level that has not been seen since 2021. Bitcoin then faced resistance at $53,000.  Sentiment has certainly improved, and people were expecting a major pop on the ETF news. The pop never came to pass. Instead Bitcoin dipped, before quickly rebounding. It might be a mistake to assume this is the start of the next bull run. That might play out in a longer manner than is expected by many Bitcoin industry pundits.  This wild ride began in August when an appeals court favored Grayscale and called the SEC’s denial of spot Bitcoin ETFs “arbitrary and capricious,” leading to a reconsideration of the petition. The SEC went on to approve the launch of 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs, forever changing the crypto industry. Now it is a mainstream industry, whereas before it really had an underground appeal that has been stamped out in the US and many other places around the world.  With the Bitcoin ETFs now live and in full swing, we are seeing in real time how investor appetite is moving on from bitcoin futures and looking into the spot Bitcoin ETFs. One benefit of that is the spot Bitcoin ETF should more closely follow the Bitcoin price than the futures. What’s more, the spot Bitcoin ETFs are issued by some of the largest and most secure institutions on the planet. Individuals and entities are clearly more comfortable with products like the Bitcoin ETF than holding raw Bitcoin.  Bitcoin ETFs will see continued success as investors prefer exposure to Bitcoin than not, especially in a familiar setting such as ETF markets with an asset secured by the world’s largest custodians, such as JPMorgan. Nothing can stop Bitcoin ETFs at this point, and it’s very likely the same will be true for Ethereum ETF, once that offering is finally approved. Crypto is abuzz in 2024. And not only amongst cypherpunks. Instead, the biggest financial players in the world constantly have Bitcoin on the tips of their tongues. Discussion on the spot Bitcoin ETFs is taking place in all sectors of the financial industry. The United States is dominating ETP markets, basically accounting for 99% of overall inflows with  $2.4 billion. Ethereum is up next.   It’s likely that the SEC will now be forced to approve the spot ethereum ETF. The argument that Ethereum futures contracts can exist while Ethereum spot ETFs cannot will likely again be found to be irrational by a court. The SEC must rule on the Ethereum ETF by May, when it will decide upon an application submitted by tech investor Cathie Wood’s company Ark Invest, and in partnership with 21Shares. That will be a turning point for the Ethereum market akin to the one Bitcoin just experienced.  In the meantime the Bitcoin ETF is inundated with attention from the financial world, especially financial advisers, who have not yet waded into the market as they must first adhere to a required waiting period for due diligence purposes. Nonetheless, institutional FOMO is here. The changing sentiment in Wall Street is not hard to see. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink once called Bitcoin an “index of money laundering” and now he calls it a “store of value.” When Fink speaks, people listen, as BlackRock is the world’s biggest money manager, holding approximately $10 trillion in assets under management. Bitcoin and Ether ETFs are likely to take center stage in the world of crypto ETFs. In fact, the SEC might not even approve any crypto spot ETFs beyond the industry’s top two coins–Bitcoin and Ethereum. Solana, which might be another candidate, has lost favor due to recent bouts of network downtime.  If not approved in May, it seems extremely likely that an Ether ETF is approved in the next year. Big money–many of the same players in the Bitcoin ETF– want to issue the ETFs in the US. Franklin Templeton, Blackrock (BRK) and Fidelity and others have already submitted applications for an ether ETF.  The arguments are clear for why the SEC should approve an ether ETF. Ethereum has institutional use cases and can be used to create new, more transparent financial markets. Big firms have been experimenting with Ethereum smart contracts for years now–dating back to at least 2015 when corporate America first started touting the virtues of blockchain. Due to its familiarity and proven track record, Ethereum could be well-positioned to be adopted at the institutional level.  The approval of the Bitcoin ETF has only made all of this more likely."

According to Arkham Intelligence, the transactions were made last Saturday, March 23. The transfer involved almost all of 37X’s entire balance of 94.5K BTC, which was worth $6.05 billion as of the time of the firm’s report. Only 1.4 BTC was left in the source after the activity. The 5th richest Bitcoin address just moved over $6 BILLION in BTC to three new addresses.37X moved almost its ENTIRE BALANCE of 94.5K BTC ($6.05B) in the early hours of Saturday 23rd March, leaving only 1.4 BTC in the address.The 94.5K BTC had not been moved since 37X… pic.twitter.com/mAjpg0oqnD Interestingly, the transaction happened as anticipation for the halving builds up, wherein the block rewards of the Bitcoin network will be cut from the present 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC upon hitting the 840,000th block height around April 20. The reduction in the daily supply production of the digital asset amid its growing institutional interest is expected to trigger a new level of scarcity for Bitcoin, which is forecasted to pump its prices post-halving. Many experts believe that the current all-time high (ATH) of BTC at $73,750.07 is not yet the top. The consensus is now betting that it might go as far as $100K by the end of 2024 following the foreseen profit-taking and consequent correction taking place around the halving event. D8X Co-Founder Basile Maire confirmed that the reduction in BTC issuance is not yet priced in the charts. His analysis was grounded on the simple law of supply and demand. Basile, however, boldly advances the $100K target for BTC to May, which is only a month after the halving. He cited the surge in open interest for $100K as his basis. The D8X co-founder also noted how the upcoming US presidential election might shake up positive changes in the crypto market. On the way to the historic national event, he said policymakers may want to ensure that the traditional markets don’t crash, or else, it will backfire on the incumbent president, Joe Biden. This, in turn, will favor the crypto community, particularly Bitcoin, because of BTC’s higher correlation to traditional finance nowadays, thanks to spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) correlated with the price movements of the digital currency. Speaking of ETFs, Basile stated that their issuers have been buying 10 times more Bitcoin on a daily basis than what miners produce within the same timeframe. Right now, the average daily production of the digital coin is 900 BTC. The halving will cut the numbers to 450 BTC, which will certainly assert more buying pressure in the market and push Bitcoin prices up."

The entity will be named Mindwave, which will be utilized to facilitate the issuance of Preferred Shares (Class C) to be converted into BTC assets. The SPE will likewise be positioned as a subsidiary of NILA. According to the press release of NILA last Monday, the partnership targets the purchase of 24,800 BTC at a discounted rate of around $1.7 billion pursuant to the prevailing prices on the market. The SPE also aims to serve as custodian for the company’s other digital assets. The other digital assets that the company is looking to acquire remain undisclosed, but if these happen to be one of the altcoins out there, like Ethereum (ETH) or even meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), or Floki (FLOKI), then expect them to pump as soon as confirmation arrives. Nilam Resources said its Bitcoin haul and other digital assets will “serve as collateral to raise capital for investment in high yield generating projects.” Meanwhile, the conditions of the acquisition will be finalized in “one or more definitive agreements.” Nilam Resources stated that the strategic partnership is anchored to its strategic vision, mission, and core values centering on an outlook where inclusivity, transparency, and sustainability merge to drive positive change in the digital economy. “Transparency, innovation, and sustainability define us,” explained company COO Pranjali More. “We prioritize clear communication, embrace cutting-edge ideas, and invest in projects with enduring social and environmental impact.” The effort capitalizes on Bitcoin’s growing recognition as the new “Gold Standard” that could potentially redefine the way we look at digital transactions in the future. This is seen as a boost in the assets of NILA as its valuation exceeds $1 billion. Nilam Resources positions itself as the next Bitcoin whale to watch out for upon execution of its BTC purchase, aligning itself with other powerhouses in the industry like MicroStrategy along the way."
2024-03-26 04:48:41+00:00,Robert Kiyosaki Predicts $100K Per Bitcoin By End Of Q3 2024,https://blockzeit.com/robert-kiyosaki-predicts-100k-per-bitcoin-by-end-of-q3-2024/,"According to the latest post of Robert Kiyosaki on X, now would be a great time to stack Bitcoin. For those who couldn’t afford a whole BTC, he recommends purchasing at least a tenth of it through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or satoshis. The “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” author forecasts the growth of BTC to $100K by September. So, he’s looking to top up his Bitcoin investment by 10 coins a few days from now. The primary driver for his positive outlook is the upcoming halving around April 20, wherein the mining rewards in the Bitcoin blockchain will be reduced from the present 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC. The passing of the event is set to cut down the daily production of Bitcoin, too, from the current average of 900 BTC per day to 450 BTC post-halving. With sustained or increase in the demand for the digital asset, supplemented by ETFs and the upcoming exchange-traded notes (ETNs) in the UK, other analysts project the largest crypto by market cap to overtake the all-time high of $73,750.07 it achieved on March 14 sooner or later. I am buying 10 more Bitcoin before April. Why? The “Having.” If you can’t afford a whole Bitcoin you may want to consider buying 1/10 of a coin, via the new ETFs or Satoshi’s.If the Bitcoin process works as designed you may own a whole Bitcoin by the end of this year. I… Kiyosaki has warned everyone of an impending economic crash for more than a decade. With the incessant money printing of the US Federal Reserve, rising global tensions, and ballooning debt of the US, all signs point out that we may be getting closer there. And it’s not just the Americans who should be worried, but also the Chinese as their property market is about to overheat while Germany is on its way to a depression. The financial book author likewise advised hedging one’s wealth in gold and silver if Bitcoin is not their cup of tea. He reminds us that gold is approximately $2,500 per Troy ounce ($2,170.92 today) while silver is around $35 per Troy ounce ($24.66 today). To further drive his point, Kiyosaki cited a quote from MicroStrategy’s Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, who once said, “What do you call people who insist on saving fiat currency… ‘fake’ money? Poor.” At present, MicroStrategy owns 214,246 BTC with a total investment of $7.52 billion. With the current price of $70,000 per BTC, it has since grown its investment to $15 billion. The company notably possesses 1% of BTC’s circulating supply, making it one of the biggest institutional whales in the Bitcoin ecosystem."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."

The 8% rally in the digital asset came after the London Stock Exchange officially announced that it will begin accepting applications for Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded notes by April 8. Trading for the ETN bonds will begin on May 28 pursuant to the approval of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). ▫️🚨The London Stock Exchange has announced that it will accept requests to list ETN bonds for Bitcoin and Ethereum effective April 8, 2024.▫️🚨The first traded bonds on the exchange for digital currencies will begin trading on May 28, 2024, subject to the approval of the… The developments followed the recent statement of the FCA that it will not get in the way of filings for crypto ETNs (cETNs) and crypto derivatives as long as they are from Recognized Investment Exchanges (RIEs). Meanwhile, reports initially said that the LSE will start accepting requests for Bitcoin and Ether ETN by the second quarter, so its latest announcement seems to be a confirmation of the exact dates. Do note, however, that the FCA has set certain limitations on who could trade cETNs. Only UK-approved RIEs as well as institutional and professional investors are allowed to dip their hands into these financial instruments. In the meantime, the LSE will only deal with Bitcoin and Ether-based ETNs, which are physically backed and non-leveraged. As of this writing at 5:00 PM UTC on Monday, Bitcoin trades around $70,200 with a nearly 8% gain in the 24-hour chart. Trading volume for the crypto asset also popped by more than 78% as $40.19 billion worth of BTC moved between wallets and exchanges within the same frame. During this period, Bitcoin moved from a $64,669.47 low to a $70,002.01 high. The current price narrows the gap between the digital currency’s ATH of $73,750.07 achieved last March 14 by 5%. The breakout of Bitcoin from its resistance during its more than a week-long consolidation phase signifies that a bull run to a new record-high price may occur soon. The renewed optimism in the crypto market once again elevates Bitcoin’s market cap to $1.38 billion, which lets it reclaim the ninth spot among the top 10 assets in the world by overall valuation."
2024-03-25 13:39:23+00:00,Iceland Looks For A Way Out Of Its Bitcoin Mining Hub Status,https://blockzeit.com/iceland-looks-for-a-way-out-of-its-bitcoin-mining-hub-status/,"Iceland has stood as a strategic location for Bitcoin mining over the years. It has been considered a haven for this industry due to its abundance of renewable and cheap energy coupled with a favorable climate for cooling mining rigs. However, the rising number of crypto mining operators in the area is already becoming a cause of concern for its leadership. Jakobsdóttir, who’s been serving as the nation’s PM since 2017, stated in an interview with the Financial Times that Iceland imports 50% of its vegetable supply and nearly 100% of its grain supply. This comes amid its energy-rich landscape, which puts it in the lead among the top 10 energy producers worldwide. Based on Luxor’s 2021 estimates, Iceland produces over 50 MWh of electricity per capita. Approximately 80% of these come from hydroelectricity plants and 20% are generated by geothermal sources. Meanwhile, the country’s population is only approximately 370,000. From these figures, roughly 120 MWh of power is directed to Bitcoin mining facilities. Jakobsdóttir believes the demand will further increase as Bitcoin miners are now reportedly upgrading their equipment to intensify their operations on the way to the halving around April 20. Although it is generally known that Iceland’s climate and terrain only hold limited agricultural potential, its teeming energy supply could be converted into facilities capable of sustaining temperatures ideal for various crops. The country’s PM showed particular interest in corn production to mitigate its food dependency on imports, especially now that the threat of trade disruptions is becoming more imminent due to global conflicts. This remains a challenge though as they compete for energy allocation with the growing number of Bitcoin miners. The fourth Bitcoin halving next month serves as a bullish event for investors as it tightens the supply of the digital asset amid its growing institutional demand. This will reduce Bitcoin mining rewards from the present 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC. Consequently, the lower rewards will reduce the existing average daily production of BTC from 900 to 450 units. Taking the current investment climate for Bitcoin into consideration, the lower supply could further push the prices up due to the massive buying pressure created by its widening institutional adoption, specially by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers. This, in turn, will incentivize Bitcoin miners to step up their game by increasing their hashrate to boost their chances of securing the limited block rewards. With the dilemma it is facing, if Iceland suddenly decides to limit the activities or impose stricter tariffs toward Bitcoin mining operations, these firms will be forced to relocate elsewhere and the country would risk missing out on this very lucrative industry."

For him, the inherent volatility of BTC is actually its vitality. Volatility is Vitality. This echoes Saylor’s earlier statement saying that price fluctuations are a much-needed feature to sustain Bitcoin’s capability to outperform the market by ten-fold. Peter Schiff, however, disagreed with the tactics of MicroStrategy. The infamous Bitcoin FUD-feeder reminded everyone that the crypto asset remained lower than its ATH despite the “reckless leveraged buying” of MicroStrategy. He likewise warned that a dip of the digital currency to $20K will shave off the BTC investment of the company to $.25 billion while a drop to $10K will further take it down to $5.5 billion. Yet despite your reckless leveraged buying, Bitcoin is still down 15% from its high price just five days ago. Now that you're done buying the bottom can really drop out of the market. When Bitcoin hits 20K MSTR will be down $3.25 billion. At 10K MSTR will be down $5.5 billion. In another post during the weekend, Saylor highlighted how Bitcoin has outperformed other traditional investments. The metric he shared showed BTC’s growth by 432% since MicroStrategy started accumulating the coin on August 10, 2020. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq only increased their values by 56% and 50% in that span. #Bitcoin is Winning. pic.twitter.com/3ESQRHKEDa The latest top-up of MicroStrategy saw the acquisition of 9,245 BTC to the tune of $623 million or $67,382 per Bitcoin. As of March 18 this year, the tech firm held 214,246 BTC in its digital vault with a total investment of $7.53 billion at an average of $35,160 per coin. As of this writing at 5:40 AM UTC on Monday, MicroStrategy seems to be in the green from its last purchase as Bitcoin is trading at around $67,500. This would still translate to an unrealized gain of $118 per BTC. Doing the math using the company’s entire haul puts its unrealized profits at $6.93 billion. Nevertheless, Saylor and MicroStrategy do not appear to be interested in pulling out their Bitcoin investment anytime soon and they even aligned their brand’s identity with the digital asset. For the executive chair of the firm, the ultimate victor would be determined based on who has the most Bitcoin in the future. So far, MicroStrategy already owns 1% of all BTC in circulation. Reading between the lines, we may see more buying spree from the company ahead."
2024-03-23 00:02:42+00:00,JPMorgan Says Bitcoin Is Still Overbought Amidst This Week’s Price Corrections,https://blockzeit.com/jpmorgan-says-bitcoin-is-still-overbought-amidst-this-weeks-price-corrections/,"Bitcoin has entered a series of new all-time highs (ATHs) since March started. In the previous week, a sign that the market was already overheating from the buying spree was already there. So just after conquering a record-high of $73,750.07 on March 14, things started going downhill, which carried over to this week. Meanwhile, massive outflows overcame the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market. Upon the announcement of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) that it was retaining the interest rates at 5.25%-5.5% on Wednesday, Bitcoin suddenly shot up by 12% to $68K to recover some of the gains it lost over the past week. Fast-forward to Friday though, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap spiraled back between a $62K low and a $67K high in the 24-hour chart. At that point, an ominous indicator is beginning to form in the charts as the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is headed for a collision with the 200-day SMA. If this occurs and forms the dreaded death cross, then it may confirm the market’s bearish trajectory. On the other hand, if such a scenario is prevented, BTC may continue its bullish momentum to test the conquest of another ATH. JPMorgan Managing Director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou confirmed overall optimism about BTC’s major rally by year-end following a potential sell-off event during the halving in April. He also expressed confidence that spot Bitcoin ETFs will possibly maintain their demand in the middle of this affair. However, the analyst warned investors and traders should be wary of the digital asset’s overbought state. “There remains considerable optimism in the market over the prospect for prices rising significantly by year-end, with a significant component of that optimism arising from a view that Bitcoin demand via spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) would continue at the same pace even as the supply of Bitcoin diminishes after the halving event,” noted Panigirtzoglou. The JPMorgan exec likewise pointed out that the hundred million outflows in the spot Bitcoin ETF sector should serve as a stark reminder that the movement of these assets is not a one-way train. “This challenges the notion that the spot Bitcoin ETF flow picture is going to be characterized as a sustained one-way net inflow,” he further explained. “In fact, as we approach the halving event this profit-taking is more likely to continue, particularly against a positioning backdrop that still looks overbought despite the past week’s correction.”"
2024-03-22 10:38:14+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Pumps 12% After Fed Leaves Interest Rates Untouched,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-price-pumps-12-after-fed-leaves-interest-rates-untouched/,"Bitcoin market cap dominance reduced this week from 49.4% last week due to the bearish sentiment the market experienced last week. Reports indicate the 10% dump BTC experienced came from Galaxy Digital selling off a huge chunk of their BTC holding. This has further pushed them down on the list of global public companies holding Bitcoin. Last week we saw the possibility of Bitcoin further falling to the $62,165 area before a bounce back up. This conclusion was brought upon by the Bitcoin price action (PA) falling below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). Over the following days, BTC bulls were unable to push the price above this indicator as it proved to be a formidable resistance. Traders who Shorted Bitcoin (BTC) from March 15 to March 20, 2024, made some profit from the 10.03% price dump. The Federal Reserve Bank on Wednesday, March 20, 2024, announced that they were not changing their interest rates again.  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell further dovishly emphasized that they would be sticking to their forecast of three rate cuts this year, despite the inflation increasing. The current interest rates of 5.25% – 5.5% are the highest in the past 23 years of American economic history.  The FOMC has left the rates in this range for the past four meetings, with this being the fifth.  Over 2 years, the Fed has hiked interest rates from near zero to the current high numbers. Bitcoin reacted positively to this news, rallying 12.14% and recouping the previous week’s losses. BTC price has been unable to break above the 50-day SMA, which is a concern among investors and traders. It shows a weakness on the part of bulls. On the lower side, the 200-day SMA has been holding nicely. March 20, 2024, was a dangerous day for BTC, and only the Fed’s good news saved the asset.  If Bitcoin continues the downward trend the 50-day SMA may cross below the 200-day SMA, forming a death cross, which is a confirmation of a full-on bearish market. Traders can short BTC until $62,000 after which, the asset is expected to bounce off this indicator and test all-time high prices again.  DISCLAIMER: The work included in this article is based on current events, technical charts, company news releases, and the author’s opinions.

2024-03-21 11:53:56+00:00,Top 7 Largest Public Companies Holding Bitcoin (BTC) In 2024,https://blockzeit.com/top-7-largest-public-companies-holding-bitcoin-btc-in-2024/,"The rise of Bitcoin has been exponential, even though halving is still three weeks away. With the rise in popularity of Bitcoin, large multinational corporations and hedge funds have accumulated Bitcoin, increasing demand for the asset among non-crypto investors. Among the major advances in Bitcoin adoption this year was the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF on January 10, 2024. Since then, Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a tremendous rally, hitting an all-time high of $74,000. This article explores a list of the top companies in the world that have bought and are holding Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin has long been regarded as a store of value by many crypto enthusiasts seeing as it has only gained against the U.S. Dollar over the past fifteen years.  In other circles, Bitcoin is referred to as Gold 2.0, or Digital Gold due to its inherent value driven by increasing demand and scarcity. Billion and trillion-dollar companies are beginning to warm up to the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.  Famous Gold perma-bulls like Peter Schiff who have constantly bashed Bitcoin can only stay quiet during these times.  By comparison, if you bought 1 ounce of Gold (worth ~$1300) in 2014 and held till today, you would have only gained $900 in profit. However, if you had put the same amount of money ($1300)  in Bitcoin, you would acquire 1.18 BTC, which today would be worth $79,400. This is a 6,000% increase in 10 years. It is for this reason – the rapid growth of this asset’s value that major companies are investing in it. Here are some of them MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) is perhaps the world’s leading public company that holds the most amount of BTC. The CEO, Michael Saylor, a known Bitcoin permabull, continues to accumulate the asset even after it hit its all-time high price recently. The $26 billion-dollar giant has a total stack of 214,246 BTC as of March 20, 2024. The company’s most recent purchase took place two days ago when it added 9,245 BTC to its existing holdings. A new player in the crypto industry, Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA) has climbed up the ranks to become the second largest company to hold the most Bitcoin. Boasting a market valuation of over $6 billion, Marathon Digital owns 16,930 BTC as of March 20, 2024. The company’s last BTC purchase was made on February 29, 2024. Headquartered in Las Vegas, the company deals with digital assets, specifically mining cryptocurrencies.  Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), the American automotive manufacturing company holds 9,720 Bitcoins. Initially, Tesla had more than this, but the company has been consistently selling the asset in a bid to fund its operations.  The last Tesla Bitcoin purchase took place on February 8, 2021, right at the beginning stages of the 2021 bull market. The company is currently valued at a mammoth $559 billion market cap, owing to the success of the Tesla electric car sales. Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) is no stranger to many crypto folks as a majority of crypto traders use their centralized exchange.  The company also owns one of the largest regulatory-compliant crypto currency exchanges in the United States of America, making them a monopoly entity in the American crypto space. With a total market cap of $62 billion, Coinbase has 9,480 BTC as of March 21, 2024. The last purchase took place on December 31, 2022. Hut 8 (NASDAQ: HUT) is lesser known to many people, but among Bitcoin miners and enthusiasts, it is a common name. The Bitcoin mining company, which recently shut down one of its mining sites in Canada, owns 9,195 BTC. The company has a market cap of $807 million and the last time to purchase Bitcoins was on January 5, 2024. Riot (NASDAQ: RIOT) only recently came into the top ranking companies when it comes to holding Bitcoin. It is a Bitcoin mining company with its headquarters in North Ametrica. The last additoon of Bitcoin to their stash was on February 29, 2024.  The company has  a total marketcap of $3.1 billion and owns 8,067 BTC. Formerly Square Inc., Block (NASDAQ: SQ) is an America-based company that creates toold for processing payments sich as hardware financial products like card readers.  Block stands at a total valuation of $50 billion, and holds 8,027 Bitcoins, which is 0.038% of the total BTC supply. The last Bitcoin purchase by Block was on February 23, 2021. These holdings reflect the growing interest of institutional investors in Bitcoin as a digital asset and a potential hedge against inflation. It’s important to note that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and the value of these holdings can change rapidly. For the most current information, it’s recommended to check the latest financial reports and market data."
2024-03-21 11:27:52+00:00,What Triggered The Recent Slump In Bitcoin And Are We In For An Even Bigger One?,https://blockzeit.com/what-triggered-the-recent-slump-in-bitcoin-and-are-we-in-for-an-even-bigger-one/,"The recent collapse of Bitcoin has once again highlighted the complex nature of the crypto market. This article therefore takes an in-depth look at both the immediate difficulties and future opportunities that this market offers. By understanding the driving factors behind the volatility, the role of macroeconomic influences and the importance of technological and political developments, investors can better navigate and make decisions in a world that is constantly characterized by innovation and uncertainty. The volatility of the crypto market is a phenomenon that fascinates and worries investors and observers alike. These fluctuations are particularly evident in Bitcoin, the lead currency or asset of the digital financial sector. A significant example of this was the recent slump in which Bitcoin fell by more than 15% from its recent highs, while most altcoins recorded losses in the high double-digit percentage range. These dramatic price movements beg the question: What is driving the volatility of the crypto market? One of the apparent reasons for the recent market volatility was the drop in the price of Bitcoin shortly after it reached nearly $74,000, a historic high. Such corrections are not uncommon and often follow the reaching of new highs, partly due to the liquidation of long positions. This happens when traders bet on rising prices but the market turns against them. The resulting need to sell the borrowed bitcoins to cover their bets leads to an abrupt drop in price. This can trigger a chain reaction in which further liquidations follow, driving the price down further. Surprisingly, this time the price continued to fall even after the initial liquidations had taken place. This suggests that there were additional factors at play beyond the usual market dynamics. Two main types of influences were identified: crypto-specific and macroeconomic factors. Crypto-specific factors refer to events and developments within the crypto industry itself, such as the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, which previously drove Bitcoin and some altcoins to new highs. On the other hand, there are macroeconomic factors, such as changes in interest rates announced by central financial authorities such as the US Federal Reserve. These can have far-reaching effects on traditional and digital markets by influencing general economic conditions and investors’ willingness to invest in riskier assets such as crypto assets. Examining the price movements of Bitcoin compared to traditional market indices such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ provides further insight. When price action is similar, it often indicates macroeconomic causes. If they differ, crypto-specific factors may be the driving force. Interestingly, the S&P 500 reached a local high on the same day that Bitcoin recorded its new all-time high. This suggests that macroeconomic factors, in particular inflation fears and the resulting expectations regarding central banks’ interest rate policies, played a significant role. The analysis shows that the volatility of the crypto market is the result of a complex interplay of various factors. While crypto-specific events such as the approval of ETFs can have a direct impact, macroeconomic conditions play an equally important role by influencing general market sentiment and investor risk appetite. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the crypto market. Macroeconomic factors play a crucial role in influencing markets, both traditionally and in the crypto asset space. These influences can take a variety of forms, from interest rates to inflation data to geopolitical events, and have the power to permanently alter the investment landscape. In particular, recent developments around interest rates and inflation in the United States offer a telling example of how profoundly such macroeconomic factors can affect the crypto market. First, the role of central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve, is of fundamental importance. Their policy on interest rates directly influences the cost of money, which in turn affects both individual investors and larger economic developments. A low interest rate can promote economic growth by encouraging businesses and consumers to borrow and spend more money. This was evident when the Federal Reserve signaled in December last year that lower interest rates were to be expected, leading to a rise in stock markets. Inflation is another key factor that can both directly and indirectly influence price movements in the crypto markets. Higher inflation expectations can reinforce the assumption that central banks will raise interest rates to cool down the economy. This in turn can lead to a retreat from riskier investments such as crypto assets. A concrete example of this was the two consecutive inflation reports in the US – the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI) – which came in higher than expected, fueling fears that the Federal Reserve may keep interest rates higher than investors had hoped. These fears about inflation and the central bank’s resulting interest rate policy have far-reaching consequences. They increase the risk of a slowdown in economic growth by making borrowing and spending more difficult. This can have a negative impact on both real economic activity and the financial markets, as today’s prices often reflect investors’ expectations of future economic policy. Interestingly, the S&P 500 and Bitcoin both fell on the day the CPI report was released, which may seem counterintuitive at first, as one would expect concerns about high inflation and accompanying higher interest rates to lead to a decline, not a rise. This suggests that there are other forces acting on these markets, possibly in the form of automated buy and sell decisions by large funds acting independently of short-term macroeconomic developments. This analysis of macroeconomic influences reveals the complexity and interconnectedness of global financial systems. It shows how central bank decisions and signals can have an impact far beyond traditional markets and highlights the importance of a deep understanding of these relationships for investors in the crypto space. The interaction between macroeconomic factors and the crypto market is a dynamic field that requires constant monitoring and analysis in order to make informed investment decisions. Forecasting the future of the crypto market is a challenge that requires a deep understanding of both market-specific dynamics and macroeconomic conditions. Over the past few months, we have observed a number of developments that are relevant to both short-term movements and long-term trends. The question of how low the market might fall, when a recovery might begin and how high the market might rise is on the minds of many investors. In the short-term time frame, the volatility of the crypto market has led to speculation about a possible recovery. One indicator that is often used at such times is the Bollinger Band indicator, which is used in technical analysis to identify potential entry and exit points. After a significant drop, Bitcoin tends to initiate a recovery rally that could take it back to the moving average of the Bollinger Band. This move, which can extend over different time frames, offers short-term trading opportunities. For example, a recovery could take Bitcoin to around USD 69,000 in the near future, which would represent a gain of around 6% from the current price level. Altcoins, which tend to be more volatile, could even see double gains. For the medium-term outlook, so-called passive flows, i.e. automated buying and selling by investment funds, are a key variable. In the past, these flows have contributed to a general upward movement of the market. Their interruption can be seen as a primary trigger for the recent decline. The resumption of these flows could be a key factor in the market’s recovery. According to market analysts, these flows could resume in the coming weeks, leading to a medium-term recovery. In the long term, trends suggest that a recovery in the crypto market will depend on a combination of macroeconomic and crypto-specific factors. A key factor is liquidity in the market, which is influenced by central banks and governments. A drop in liquidity could lead to further corrections, but a subsequent increase in liquidity could set the stage for the next rally. Another important aspect is the halving of Bitcoin, which is expected to take place in April. This event could prove bullish for Bitcoin and the entire crypto market, especially if flows from spot Bitcoin ETFs remain strong before and after the halving. In addition, decisions by central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, in their next meeting at the end of April could have a significant impact on the market. The economic data going into the meeting could lead to either bullish or bearish sentiment, depending on expectations for interest rate policy. The combination of these factors paints a mixed picture for the crypto market recovery. In the short to medium-term timeframe, technical indicators and the resumption of passive flows could play a role. In the long term, however, market performance is likely to depend on a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, political decisions and the development of specific crypto projects. For investors, this means that a diversified and well-informed strategy is essential. The need to incorporate both technical analysis and fundamental valuations into their investment decisions is becoming increasingly apparent. The ability to distinguish between short-term market movements and long-term appreciation potential could be the key to success. Investors need to develop the ability to interpret macroeconomic trends and their potential impact on the crypto market. This includes an understanding of how global economic uncertainties, interest rates, inflation rates and geopolitical events can affect market sentiment. At the same time, it is important to keep an eye on developments within the crypto space itself, including regulatory changes, technological advances and the introduction of new products and services that have the potential to change the landscape. The development of specific crypto projects will also play an important role. Projects that can solve real problems and build a strong user base have the potential to succeed in the long term and generate significant returns for investors. The ability to identify these promising projects at an early stage is becoming an increasingly valuable skill. For investors, this means that continuous education and research are essential to survive in the fast-moving crypto market. Holding a diversified portfolio that includes different types of crypto assets could also help to spread risk and minimize the impact of market fluctuations. Ultimately, it is important to maintain a long-term perspective and not be distracted by short-term price fluctuations. The crypto market has already gone through several cycles of ups and downs, and each cycle offers learning opportunities and the chance for renewal. Investors who remain patient, research thoroughly and take a strategic approach may be best positioned to benefit from the long-term developments of the crypto market. The long-term outlook for the crypto market is characterized by a mixture of optimism and caution. Various factors, both within the crypto sector and the broader macroeconomic environment, play a role in shaping this outlook. Long-term investors and market observers are focusing their attention on a number of key events and developments that could potentially have a groundbreaking impact on the crypto market. A key aspect influencing the long-term outlook of the crypto market is the monetary policy of central banks around the world. The expectation that most central banks will cut interest rates by 2025 could prove to be a catalyst for the crypto market. Lower interest rates could boost economic growth and encourage investors to invest in riskier assets such as crypto assets. Furthermore, by then central banks could be legally authorized to include crypto assets on their balance sheets, which would significantly increase the legitimacy and acceptance of crypto assets. Political events, particularly elections, can also have a significant impact on markets. Historical data shows that market returns tend to be higher in election years, with average stock market returns of around 11% compared to 7% in non-election years. Populist and contested elections in particular appear to generate even higher returns, suggesting that political uncertainty and change can present investors with both risks and opportunities. This dynamic could also extend to the crypto market, especially if political decisions influence the regulatory framework for crypto assets. The increasing acceptance of crypto assets by institutional investors and large financial institutions is another factor strengthening the long-term prospects of the market. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs and the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs could drive a significant influx of institutional capital into the crypto market. At the same time, technological advances in blockchain technology and crypto-assets projects could improve the efficiency, security and scalability of the sector, which in turn would boost market adoption and growth. In terms of price development, there are various forecasts covering a wide range of possibilities. Some analysis suggests that Bitcoin’s all-time high could be between $120,000 and $200,000, depending on factors such as inflation and the extent of money creation during the pandemic. Similar calculations could be made for other leading crypto-assets such as Ethereum, whose price targets could also rise significantly. However, it is important to note that such forecasts should be taken with a grain of salt and must take into account a variety of uncertainty factors. The long-term outlook for the crypto market is both promising and uncertain. While macroeconomic factors, political developments and technological advances offer potential for significant growth, challenges such as regulatory uncertainty and market volatility remain. For investors, this means that careful analysis and a deep understanding of underlying trends and risks are essential to make informed decisions. The ability to interpret macroeconomic indicators and political signals, coupled with a thorough understanding of technological developments in the crypto space, will be crucial to succeed in the long term. It is also important to consider the dynamics of the crypto market in the context of global financial markets. The integration of crypto-assets into the traditional financial system is progressing, and the reactions of regulators to these developments will significantly shape the sector. The potential introduction of crypto assets onto central bank balance sheets could revolutionize the market and take it to new heights. Long-term investors should prepare for a journey characterized by technological breakthroughs, regulatory adjustments and the gradual acceptance of crypto assets as part of the broader financial ecosystem. The prospect of increasing institutional participation suggests that the crypto market is ripe for further growth, but this journey will not be without its challenges. In conclusion, the long-term prospects of the crypto market are characterized by a mix of great potential and significant risks. Those willing to look closely at these complex dynamics could find themselves in a strong position to benefit from future developments in the crypto market. It remains a sector known for both its innovation and unpredictability, and this is what makes it so intriguing to many investors. Analysis of the crypto market reveals a complex picture in which short-term volatility and long-term growth potential are closely intertwined. The reasons for the recent market movements lie both in specific events within the crypto sector and in overarching macroeconomic factors. In the short term, technical analysis and the return of passive investment flows could provide clues for recovery moments. In the long term, however, market performance will depend on a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, policy decisions and the progress of individual crypto projects. For investors, this means that a balanced and informed investment strategy that considers both short-term trends and keeps an eye on long-term developments is crucial. The ability to react to change while maintaining a long-term perspective will be key to success in the ever-changing environment of the crypto market."
2024-03-21 09:29:42+00:00,Bitcoin Recovers $68K As Fed Keeps Interest Rates At 5.25%-5.5%,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-recovers-68k-as-fed-keeps-interest-rates-at-5-25-5-5/,"The important announcement of FOMC pushed Bitcoin to peak at $68,199.99 in the past 24 hours from a low of $62,082.55. As of this writing at 8:30 AM UTC on Thursday, BTC is now trading in the $67,300 range with a 7% gain within the same frame. However, its transaction volume is down by 17% as the flow slid to $58.21 billion. The rally brought back the market cap of the 19.66 million BTC in circulation to $1.32 trillion. This brings the digital asset back to the 9th place among the top assets in the world by overall value as it overtakes Meta Platforms’ $1.29 trillion market cap. The all-time high of Bitcoin remains at the $73,750.07 it achieved seven days ago before heavy profit-taking by investors wiped the gains and tanked prices within the $61K territory. Today’s price is around 8% away from BTC’s latest historic high. The FOMC is a branch of the Federal Reserve System (FRS) tasked with determining the direction of the USA’s monetary policy. The committee is composed of 12 members who are scheduled to meet at least eight times annually within closed doors. The recent meeting of the group kept interest rates 5.25% to 5.5%, which no longer came as a surprise for market watchers, considering that the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data reflected a 3.2% spike in inflation for February compared to January’s 3.1%. The new figures moved further away from Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s 2% target for a soft landing. Despite that, some analysts anticipate rate cuts coming in by June. Powell remains confident as well that the readings could eventually enter their target. “The other thing is, in the second half of the year, you had some pretty low readings, so it might be harder to make that 12 month window forward,” the Fed chairman said in a news briefing following the FOMC meeting. “Nonetheless, we’re looking for data that confirm the low readings that we had last year and give us a higher degree of confidence that what we saw was really inflation moving sustainably down to 2%.” The conclusion of the FOMC meeting saw all major indices close at a record high not seen since November 2021. Nasdaq was up by 1.03%, S&P gained 0.89%, and Dow Jones jumped by 1.25%."
2024-03-20 08:12:47+00:00,"Peter Schiff FUDs On Bitcoin ETFs, MicroStrategy, and GPIF",https://blockzeit.com/peter-schiff-fuds-on-bitcoin-etfs-microstrategy-and-gpif/,"Like a scavenger waiting for its prey to weaken, Peter Schiff once again saw an opportunity to bash Bitcoin as its prices dipped following a series of all-time highs in the past couple of weeks. This time, his targets were Bitcoin ETFs, MicroStrategy’s latest BTC purchase, and the possibility of the digital asset’s inclusion in Japan’s GPIF investment portfolio. One problem with owning #Bitcoin in an ETF is that liquidity is limited to U.S. market hours. So if the market crashes overnight, you have no ability to sell until the U.S. market opens for trading in the morning. Very frustrating to watch helplessly with no ability to get out. First off, Schiff took a potshot on Bitcoin ETFs on X because of their limited liquidity, which is tied to their trading hours in US exchanges. He said this could prove to be catastrophic for investors who will have to wait for the opening of the market to get out of their positions when BTC price immediately crashes during market close. The chairman of SchiffGold added that ETFs are the only things holding Bitcoin together. Without them, the dips would be lower than they are now. Likewise, he warned about a possible scenario where all ETFs would suddenly have outflows. MSTR is already down over $115 million on the #Bitcoin it just bought with borrowed money. I wonder why @saylor always borrows money to buy Bitcoin after a big move up. It looks like his true intention is to manipulate the Bitcoin price higher as he dumps his own $MSTR shares. MicroStrategy once again got into the spotlight yesterday when its executive chairman, Michael Saylor, announced its 9,245 Bitcoin acquisition for $623 million at $67,382 per BTC. At the time of Schiff’s rant on the company, MSTR’s last top-up on the crypto asset was down by around $115 million. As of this writing at 7:30 AM UTC on Wednesday, the prime cryptocurrency is still down by over 2% in the 24-hour chart as it trades around $62,500 a pop. This came despite the 20% rally in its transaction volume as $71.21 billion worth of BTC moved between wallet addresses. At this point, MicroStrategy holds 214,246 BTC at $35,160 per Bitcoin. Doing the match, the current price of the digital currency still puts the unrealized profits of Saylor’s company from its Bitcoin investment at $5.84 billion. Japan's Govt. Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) announced they will ""explore diversifying a portion"" of their portfolio into #Bitcoin. My guess is they won't. If they really were leaning toward buying Bitcoin, the last thing they'd do is make their intentions public before buying. Lastly, Schiff commented on the disclosure of GPIF, Japan’s biggest pension fund by assets under management (AUM), about its plan to include Bitcoin in its investment portfolio. As expected, the American investor wasn’t buying it. “My guess is they won’t,” he said. “If they really were leaning toward buying Bitcoin, the last thing they’d do is make their intentions public before buying.” Yesterday, GPIF announced that it is evaluating several illiquid assets for the expansion of its investment portfolio. Among the key considerations were gold and Bitcoin."
2024-03-20 06:50:30+00:00,Largest Japanese Pension Fund Plans On Investing In Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/largest-japanese-pension-fund-plans-on-investing-in-bitcoin/,"We may be witnessing the dawn of Bitcoin’s golden age as more traditional financial powerhouses are now recognizing its potential. Last Tuesday, the Government Pension Investment Fund of Japan revealed that it is evaluating the inclusion of Bitcoin in its investment portfolio alongside other illiquidity assets. Bitcoin going into the radar of the GPIF is big news in the cryptocurrency industry as the government agency is considered the world’s top pension fund in terms of assets under management. Based on the financial institution’s 2023 annual report, the fund yielded 14.3 trillion yen ($94 billion) in returns from foreign equities and 12.88 trillion yen ($85 billion) from domestic equities. The development is seen by the wider crypto industry as a possible bridge for further adoption of similar assets in the digital realm like altcoins into investment or pension funds. The move also reaffirms Japan’s positive stance toward BTC and digital assets. GPIF utilizes its funds for bonds, stocks, real estate, infrastructure, and private equities in and out of Japan. It is currently looking to expand its illiquidity assets portfolio to include gold, forests, farmlands, and Bitcoin. The Japanese pension fund’s interest in BTC came hot on the heels of a proposed law in the country that would allow investment funds to include digital assets such as cryptocurrencies in their offerings. So far, most traditional investment firms have steered clear of cryptocurrencies because of their inherently volatile nature. Nonetheless, this didn’t thwart some forward-thinking entities from exploring the digital currency frontier. One of them happened to be South Korea’s National Pension Service, which now has crypto exposure thanks to its acquisition of Coinbase shares last year. Bitcoin just registered a one-week low of $60,807.79 before settling at $61,900 as of this writing at 6:30 AM UTC on Wednesday. The recent dip in BTC’s valuation has also dragged down its market cap to $1.22 trillion, which dropped the premier cryptocurrency from last week’s eighth to today’s tenth among the top 10 assets in the world by market cap. The all-time high of the digital asset remains at $73,750.07, which it achieved last March 14."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2024-03-19 16:19:49+00:00,Why Is Bitcoin Crashing? – Is The End In Sight Or Is It Just The Beginning?,https://blockzeit.com/why-is-bitcoin-crashing-is-the-end-in-sight-or-is-it-just-the-beginning/,"Recent developments in the Bitcoin market have triggered a wave of uncertainty affecting both experienced investors and newcomers alike. The rapid upward movement, followed by abrupt corrections, has raised questions about the sustainability of this trend and the best strategies for navigating these volatile waters. In this context, the following analysis aims to shed light on recent market movements, examine the underlying factors that have led to the current situation and outline possible future scenarios. Combining technical indicators, historical patterns and strategic investment approaches, this review provides valuable insight and advice for investors looking to make informed decisions in these uncertain times. The recent performance of the Bitcoin market has surprised many investors and analysts alike. After Bitcoin reached a peak of over USD 73,000, a period of uncertainty began, characterized by a sudden and steep decline in the price of Bitcoin. Within a short period of time, the price of Bitcoin fell from USD 73,000 to USD 66,000. This drop of USD 7,000 triggered a broad discussion in the market about the causes and possible long-term effects of this event. The abrupt price drop illustrates the volatility and unpredictability of the crypto assets market. Investors who had previously speculated that the bull market would continue and reach new highs were suddenly confronted with the reality of a potential market correction. This sudden turnaround left many wondering whether this was just a short-term price correction or whether it could be the start of a longer downtrend. During this phase, market participants and analysts began to intensively assess the possible causes and extent of the correction. Some saw the decline as a natural correction after a long period of significant price increases. Others, however, interpreted the price decline as a harbinger of a more profound market correction that could have far-reaching effects on the market as a whole. Prior to the price decline, warning signals had already been identified that the market was overheating. These signals included a number of technical indicators and market patterns that historically have often occurred prior to major market corrections. Despite these warnings, many market participants were surprised by the speed and magnitude of the decline. One key aspect that has been highlighted during this phase is market psychology. The transition from an extremely greedy market to an environment characterized by uncertainty illustrates the rapid change in investor sentiment. In times of extreme greed, investors tend to underestimate the potential risks, which can lead to overly optimistic market forecasts. The sudden price drop thus acted as a wake-up call, forcing a more realistic assessment of the market situation. The correction phase in the Bitcoin market serves as a reminder of the inherent volatility and unpredictability of crypto assets. It emphasizes the need for investors to continually educate themselves on market conditions and potential risk factors. While such corrections present challenges for some market participants, they offer others the opportunity to rethink their positions and trade strategically. Analyzing this phase offers valuable insights into market behavior and the importance of a sound investment strategy. Related article: The Current Bitcoin Market: Analysis and Outlook After the New All-Time High Technical indicators play a central role in analyzing and predicting crypto asset markets, especially in Bitcoin’s volatile environment. Particular attention is paid to the combination of different indicators, which together can provide deeper insights into the market. The importance of these technical tools, specifically the 13-SMA (Simple Moving Average) and a unique combined indicator, is discussed below. The 13-SMA (Simple Moving Average) is a moving average that calculates and smoothes the average closing prices of the last 13 periods. On the two-week chart of Bitcoin, the 13-SMA provides important insights into the price action above this critical average line. The positioning of the Bitcoin price in relation to the 13-SMA can indicate whether the market is trending bullish or bearish. Another crucial approach in technical analysis is the use of a combined indicator, which brings together three of the most effective technical indicators. This comprehensive indicator integrates the strengths of individual tools to provide a more robust and reliable market analysis. The developer of this indicator describes it as “untouchable” as it brings together the three best indicators for trading Bitcoin and other altcoins into a single tool. This integration makes it possible to more precisely identify both the overbought zone above the yellow channel and the oversold zone below it. The analysis shows that Bitcoin is currently extremely overbought, which is confirmed by the combined indicator and the comparison with the historical price action. In the 14-year history of Bitcoin, there have only been four other periods in which overbought conditions were similarly pronounced. These periods correlate significantly with the absolute market peaks of 2011, 2013, 2017 and 2021. The implication is clear: such high levels of overbought typically indicate an impending correction. The indicator not only provides insights into market conditions, but also offers concrete recommendations for action. For example, it suggests that buying Bitcoin is advisable when the market reaches the lower yellow zone – which in the past has been near the lows of market movements. Conversely, it recommends taking profits when the market is in the upper yellow zone, which has historically corresponded to market peaks. A detailed look at technical indicators, particularly the 13-SMA on the two-week chart and an innovative combined indicator, provides important insights for understanding Bitcoin’s current market situation. These tools highlight the extreme overbought nature of the market and historical patterns that point to a potential correction. Investors and traders can use these analyses to make informed decisions and adjust their strategies accordingly. Related article: Bitcoin: A Detailed Analysis Of The Current Situation And A Guide To Future-Oriented Investment Strategies Analyzing historical data and market patterns provides valuable insights into the potential future movements of the Bitcoin price. By looking at the past, we can understand how certain patterns repeat themselves and what this could mean for the current market cycle. The overbought situation that Bitcoin has recently found itself in is not unique. In its 14-year history, Bitcoin has been in a similarly strong overbought phase a total of five times. These phases were determined by the indicator on the two-week chart with the 13-SMA (Simple Moving Average). The fact that we were in the fifth strongest overbought phase in Bitcoin’s history is a strong signal that the market could be undergoing a correction. An interesting and recurring pattern that emerges from historical analysis is that Bitcoin enters the overbought zone exactly twice in each market cycle. The first time Bitcoin enters this zone does not mark the peak of the market cycle, while the second time is often close to the cycle peak. For example, in 2013, Bitcoin entered the overbought zone twice; the first time was not at the cycle peak, but the second time marked the peak. Similarly, in 2017 and 2021, the pattern repeated itself: a first entry into the overbought zone, followed by a second that signaled the market cycle peak. It is important to mention that despite historical patterns and technical indicators, external events and unexpected developments can influence the market. Events such as the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that unforeseen factors can quickly change market conditions and investor sentiment. Historically, the corrective phases that have followed entry into the overbought zone have been significant. One example is the correction in 2013, when Bitcoin corrected by around 75% after reaching an extremely overbought level before rising to new highs. These corrections are necessary to clear the market and create a solid base for the next growth phase. The historical parallels and market patterns we observe are crucial to understanding Bitcoin’s current market situation. They show that although the market may be heavily overbought and a correction may be imminent, such phases are natural parts of the market cycle. They also provide opportunities for strategic investments. The challenge for investors is to learn from history, carefully analyze the current market conditions and act accordingly. Related article: Bitcoin: A light amid global financial turmoil The Fear and Greed Index plays a crucial role in assessing market sentiment in the crypto-asset space. It measures the emotional states of investors and can indicate whether greed or fear is dominating the market. Extreme greed often indicates that the market is overbought and a correction may be imminent, while extreme fear indicates a potentially undervalued market. Crypto Fear and Greed Index March 19, 2024 At the time of analysis, the Fear and Greed Index indicated extreme greed. This state is not only an indicator of the current market sentiment, but also a warning signal. Historical data shows that when the index reaches such extreme values, this often happens shortly before major market corrections In the last six years, the index has only reached a comparable level of extreme greed twice. These moments correlated with significant market peaks, which were followed by corrections. One such moment was the peak at 14k (USD 14,000), another was when it reached its all-time high. These historical data points support the thesis that extreme greed in the market often signals an impending correction. The current overbought situation, reinforced by the high level of the Fear and Greed Index, underlines the risk of a correction in the Bitcoin market. When the market is extremely greedy, this can be seen as a sign that many investors are already invested and the potential for further growth through new purchases is limited. This can lead to a self-correction as investors take profits and fewer buyers are willing to jump in when prices are high. As well as showing the current state of the market, the index also emphasizes the importance of psychology in trading. In times of extreme greed, it is particularly important for investors to remain disciplined and not follow the herd mentality. History has shown that it is often wise to act contrary to prevailing market sentiments – to be cautious when others are greedy and to be bold when others are fearful. The Fear and Greed Index is a valuable tool for investors to understand market sentiment and identify potential turning points in the market cycle. The current extreme greed signals potential risks and the need for careful market analysis. Investors should use this information to make informed decisions and develop strategies to navigate through potentially turbulent market phases. Forecasting future market developments is based on careful analysis of technical indicators and historical data. By understanding these factors, analysts and investors can make informed assumptions about the likely direction of the Bitcoin market. One of the key indicators used in the analysis is the 13-SMA (Simple Moving Average) on the two-week chart. Together with the Stochastic RSI (Relative Strength Index) on the monthly chart, this indicator provides important insights into current market sentiment and potential future movements. The analysis shows that once Bitcoin enters the overbought zone and the Stochastic RSI line begins to curve, this has historically been a reliable sign of an impending correction. At the time of analysis, the market is in such a potentially critical phase, with the first signs of a bend visible. This indicator has so far proven to be a reliable tool for predicting major corrections. The Stochastic RSI on the monthly chart currently shows that the momentum indicator is at 100, indicating a strong overbought situation. Historically, such extreme values have been followed by significant corrections. It is particularly noteworthy that the indicator has remained at this high for 91 days, a historical maximum that underlines the urgency of a potential correction. Analysis of historical data points shows that whenever the Stochastic RSI reached and subsequently crossed these high levels, significant market corrections followed. These patterns provide a basis for predicting that a similar development is also possible in the current market situation. Given the potential for market volatility, a strategic approach to investing is recommended. One method is to stagger investments based on the depth of the market correction. For example, an investor could invest 20% of their capital if the market corrects by 15-20% and make further investments if the market falls further. This strategy makes it possible to lower the average purchase price and profit from an eventual market recovery. The future of the Bitcoin market remains uncertain, but by analyzing technical indicators and historical patterns, investors can be better prepared. Current signs suggest that caution is warranted, especially given the extreme overbought situation and high market sentiment. A strategic, well-thought-out investment strategy can help minimize risk and benefit from potential corrections. In times of high market volatility, it is crucial for investors to act strategically and thoughtfully. Understanding how to invest during such periods can make the difference between significant gains and losses. Valuable strategies can be derived from the current Bitcoin market. A tried and tested method in times of uncertainty is to stagger investments. This means that investors do not invest their capital all at once, but in predetermined steps based on certain market developments. An example illustrates this strategy: With a market correction of 15-20%, it might be advisable to act cautiously and invest 20% of your available capital first. Assuming you have EUR 100 available for investment, you would invest EUR 20 in this scenario. Should the correction deepen to 20-30%, you could consider investing a further 35% of the original capital. This means that having already committed €20, an additional €35 would now be invested to take advantage of lower prices. If the market continues to fall and reaches a correction of 30-50%, it might be an option worth considering to invest the remaining capital. In our example, this would be the remaining 45 euros. This move could serve to reduce the average purchase price of the investment and thus better position yourself for a possible market recovery. However, it is important to make such decisions carefully and in consideration of your own risk profile. This investment strategy is based on the principle of dollar-cost averaging (DCA), which aims to minimize risk by spreading the timing of purchases. By investing at lower price levels, the average purchase price of the investment is reduced, allowing for potentially higher returns when the market recovers. A key aspect of this strategy is risk management. By allocating investments and waiting for certain price corrections before committing additional capital, investors can minimize the risk of significant loss. This method allows investors to react flexibly to market changes and benefit from lower prices without risking all their capital at once. Thorough preparation and discipline are crucial to the success of this strategy. Investors should plan in advance how much capital they want to invest in which market corrections. These plans should then be implemented consistently, regardless of short-term market fluctuations or emotional impulses. The investment strategy presented here offers a pragmatic approach to investing in highly volatile markets such as Bitcoin. By staggering investments based on predefined market correction criteria, investors can spread their risk and improve their chances of long-term success. The key is to remain disciplined and not be led by the prevailing market sentiment or your own emotions. Analyzing the Bitcoin market based on recent developments and technical indicators provides a profound insight into potential future moves. We have seen that the overbought situation, reinforced by the extremely high Fear and Greed Index, points to an imminent correction. Historical data and patterns, such as the repeated entry into the overbought zone in each market cycle, reinforce this assumption and suggest that we may not yet have reached the peak of the current cycle. Investors are now faced with the challenge of making strategic decisions in a market characterized by volatility and uncertainty. The proposed investment strategy of staggering investments based on the extent of the correction offers a pragmatic approach to minimize risk and benefit from potential market recoveries. However, this requires a disciplined approach and a willingness to trade against prevailing market sentiment, especially in times of extreme greed. Given the current market indicators and historical patterns, a cautious approach seems appropriate. Investors should closely monitor developments around the Bitcoin market, especially technical indicators such as the Stochastic RSI and the Fear and Greed Index, for early signs of a potential trend reversal. A willingness to trade strategically and stagger investments according to market conditions will be crucial to navigate through the expected turbulent times. In the long term, these volatile periods could provide significant buying opportunities, provided the investment strategy is well thought out and based on sound analysis rather than impulsive decisions. History has shown that every significant correction is followed by a recovery phase that can offer potential gains for long-term investors. The current market situation underlines the importance of patience, research and strategic planning in the investment process. Ed Prinz is co-founder and CEO of https://loob.io.

As of 3/18/24, $MSTR hodls 214,246 $BTC acquired for ~$7.53B at average price of $35,160 per bitcoin. https://t.co/oeYJGgiuy0 MicroStrategy made a monumental Bitcoin purchase once again. According to its Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the Bitcoin development company just added 9,245 BTC to its coffers for around $623 million at an average price of $67,382 per coin. The funds were raised from the firm’s sale of convertible notes last week and excess cash. The latest acquisition magnifies the total supply of the firm to 214,246 BTC as of March 18, 2024. This puts its overall investment in the digital asset at $7.53 billion within an average price of $35,160 per Bitcoin. The latest move of MSTR doesn’t appear to be nudging the Bitcoin market like it used to. As of this writing at 1:00 PM UTC on Tuesday, which is around an hour after Saylor’s announcement, the premier cryptocurrency remains down by 7% on the 24-hour chart with a price of $63,300. It’s likely that BTC is still reeling from the recent flash crash at Bitmex. Nevertheless, the trading volume of BTC went up by 70% within the period as $69.14 billion worth of the coin was transacted as prices moved between a $62,478.44 low and a $68,552.94 high. Before anything else, let’s be clear that MicroStrategy does not plan on selling its Bitcoin supply anytime soon. This has been repeatedly emphasized by Saylor during interviews, and it was clearly evident when the company didn’t budge despite the series of all-time high (ATH) records broken by BTC in the past consecutive weeks. The latest of which was the $73,750.07 top achieved last Thursday. For educational purposes, however, it should be noted that MSTR now sits on $13.56 billion worth of Bitcoin with an unrealized gain of $6.03 billion. This could have been higher last week if it sold its previous 205,000 BTC haul right at the peak of $72K per BTC, which would have earned it $7.9 billion. Some experts like Rekt Capital warned that Bitcoin may be on its way to a correction after showing signs of overheating from its series of ATHs. The crypto asset’s past behavior 14 to 28 days prior to each halving event in 2016 and 2020 also reinforced its assumptions. Nonetheless, Rekt and the consensus see the impending dip as a healthy movement for the world’s leading crypto by market cap. For them, the retracements could only serve as an ideal launch pad for Bitcoin once it hits a new level of scarcity post-halving."
2024-03-19 12:32:06+00:00,Bitcoin Crashed To $8.9K On Bitmex: What Happened?,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-crashed-to-8-9k-on-bitmex-what-happened/,"A peculiar event suddenly sent ripples in the Bitcoin market as a “rogue seller” caused the price of the prime cryptocurrency to crash from $68,398 to $8,900 at the Bitmex exchange around 10:40 PM UTC on Monday. All 87% of BTC’s value in US dollars was wiped out in minutes. However, its price climbed back to the $67,000 mark 10 minutes later and has stabilized since. Bitmex immediately acknowledged the anomalous transaction that shook the market with the assurance that all its users’ funds were safe. It explained that although the incident caused volatility in its BTC-USDT spot market, neither its derivative markets nor the index price of its XBT derivatives contracts was impacted. 🚨BREAKING: A ROGUE SELLER ON BITMEX BTC SPOT MARKET RAPIDLY SOLD OVER 400 BTC BRINGING THE PRICE TO AS LOW AS $8,900 pic.twitter.com/HKxhdxmsu9 The platform has also clarified that it has frozen some withdrawals initiated by accounts suspectedly linked to the flash crash. Just to clarify: We have NOT disabled withdrawals for all users, but only for a few accounts that are part of the investigation. As we await the results of Bitmex’s official probe on the matter, there have been contrasting claims about the amount of BTC actually involved in the flash crash. Some analysts on X said the sell-off of more than 400 BTC triggered it, but the investigation and tally of the pseudonymous “syq” on the social media platform placed it between 850 BTC and nearly 1,000 BTC. I'm guessing that they're done (for now?😂) Total volume so far is just shy of 1,000 BTC over 3.5 hours with a low of $8,900. pic.twitter.com/hdVmYM1YkI The Bitmex incident wasn’t the first Bitcoin flash crash in history. There have been similar occurrences in the past, but the Binance crash in 2021 somehow mirrored the magnitude of the Bitmex situation wherein the leading crypto by market cap briefly tanked from $65,000 to $8,200 in the world’s largest crypto exchange. The problem was traced to a faulty algorithm in Binance, but the one in Bitmex was allegedly catalyzed by a “rogue seller.” TradingView defined this type of trader as a seller who dumps a massive supply of a certain asset without consideration of its possible impact on the market. However, it is not also dismissing the probability of a faulty algo like the Binance case three years ago. So far, everything is back to business within Bitmex amid the pending investigation of the flash crash incident. As of this writing at 11:50 AM UTC on Tuesday, Bitcoin is trading at around $63,200 with a 7% dip in its 24-hour price. Meanwhile, transaction volume was up by 64% as $67.25 billion worth of BTC moved between addresses. The price movement of Bitcoin in key indexes like CoinMarketCap may not have been straight-up affected by the Bitmex affair but it drove the values all the way down to $62,478.44 from a peak of $68,552.94 within the one-day frame."
2024-03-18 13:52:43+00:00,Bitfinex Expresses Concerns On The Centralization Of Bitcoin Mining Post-Halving,https://blockzeit.com/bitfinex-expresses-concerns-on-the-centralization-of-bitcoin-mining-post-halving/,"For investors, the halving marks another cycle that could propel BTC to new heights. It marks a renewed hope for another bull run as supply for the digital currency tightens amid the growing institutional demand. However, this event may not bode well for small players in the Bitcoin mining sector. Early on, Riot Platforms posted a bleak outlook on the future of Bitcoin mining past the halving. It said there would be “no guarantee” that it would result in positive changes in terms of the company’s profitability. And that’s even coming from one of the largest institutions in the industry, so just imagine what lies ahead for smaller players. A recent report from Bitfinex piled into the worries of these entities as it just posted a forecast that the halving in Bitcoin’s ecosystem may force smaller miners to exit in droves. The ensuing scenario could mean the consolidation of mining power in larger companies, which could ultimately deconstruct the decentralized framework originally envisioned by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto that has defined Bitcoin over the years. For Bitfinex, the concentration of power could potentially lead to censorship of transactions as well as exploits within the Bitcoin network. It could likewise increase its exposure to regulatory pressures. “Centralization risks could mean the potential censorship of transactions and increased vulnerability to coordinated attacks or regulatory pressures,” said the world’s longest-running crypto exchange. Nevertheless, Bitfinex expressed optimism that the block reward reduction past the halving would still enable sustainable operations for miners. The subsequent scarcity amplified by rising institutional demand could trigger higher prices for the Fiat currency conversion of Bitcoin. “If the price of Bitcoin rises sufficiently, it could offset the reduced block reward, maintaining or even increasing mining profitability,” noted the exchange. “This price appreciation is critical for encouraging continued investment and participation in mining activities.” At the time of writing at 1:20 PM UTC on Monday, Bitcoin continues to hover around the $68,000 mark with a 1.3% increase in its value over the 24-hour period. This is, however, 7% lower than the all-time high of $73,750.07 it achieved four days ago, but is still 31% higher in the monthly frame and 146% up on the one-year frame. There remains confidence that BTC will resume its climb to new all-time highs after the halving based on historical data paired with the growing interest of institutions toward the digital asset."
2024-03-18 08:35:25+00:00,"Bitcoin Is Positioned On A Danger Zone, But Crypto Firms See A Silver Lining Up Ahead",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-is-on-a-danger-zone-but-crypto-firms-remain-optimistic/,"With only 32 days to go before the Bitcoin halving, analysts warned investors to brace themselves for a major dip between Tuesday and Wednesday. This is no FUD, but according to the people at Rekt Capital, historical trends indicate that movements like this happen 14 to 28 days prior to the event. “In 2 days, Bitcoin will officially enter the ‘Danger Zone’ where historical pre-halving retraces have begun,” cautioned Rekt. Based on its charts, the cryptocurrency slumped as low as 40% before the second halving in 2016 and 20% leading to the third halving in 2020. #BTCIn 2 days, Bitcoin will officially enter the ""Danger Zone"" (orange) where historical Pre-Halving Retraces have begunHistorically, Bitcoin has performed Pre-Halving Retraces 14-28 days before the HalvingIn 2020, this retrace was -20% deepIn 2016, this retrace was -40%… pic.twitter.com/rnKjznsGHk As of this writing at 7:40 AM UTC, Bitcoin has shown a 4% recovery to $68,100 in the 24-hour frame. This brings up the overall valuation of its 19.66 million circulating supply to $1.34 trillion, which allows it to keep its ninth position among the top 10 assets in the world by market cap. Meanwhile, trading volume dunked by 20% as $41.74 billion worth of BTC moved between wallets and exchanges within the period. The same span saw prices pivot between a $64,545.32 low and a $68,897.13 high. BTC achieved a series of all-time highs (ATHs) in the past few weeks, which culminated in $73,750.07 last March 14. Such height made it surpass silver’s market cap temporarily as its supply blew the roof off at $1.44 trillion. On the bright side, Bitcoin has shown major leaps since the long crypto winter back in 2022 to 2023. Over a year, the digital currency rose by more than 148% as it broke new ATHs. Going back to the record books, the upcoming BTC price movements may be no different than the market’s behavior during the past halving epochs. With the stronger demand for the digital asset these days, thanks to the rising institutional demand primarily caused by the regulatory approval of several Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) and the aggressive accumulation of financial firms, the upcoming dips may only serve as a perfect launch pad for Bitcoin’s new frontier as its supply tightens post-halving. Binance CEO Richard Teng aired his optimism toward the crypto asset during a speech in Bangkok on Sunday. Citing the abovementioned factors as the basis, he believes $80,000 per BTC may not be far ahead. Crypto.com co-founder and CEO Kris Marszalek expressed the same view in an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box. He said the latest price drop in Bitcoin was a “healthy move” as it removed some of the leverage that built up within its ecosystem. This could pave the way to “less sudden moves” for its values and a “steady ramp-up” in its prices over the years.  "
2024-03-17 06:07:26+00:00,Bitwise CIO: Bitcoin May Lose Its Rep As A Volatile Asset At Some Point,https://blockzeit.com/bitwise-cio-bitcoin-may-lose-its-rep-as-a-volatile-asset-at-some-point/,"The apprehensions of investors toward Bitcoin usually lie in its energy use and volatility. The former is already aging poorly because of how Bitcoin mining companies are now shifting toward renewable energy sources to enable more sustainable operations amid the rising cost of electricity and regulatory pressure. That only leaves the latter, which is actually hard to defend because of the digital asset’s evidently short-term fluctuations right now. However, former Inside ETFs Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and current Bitwise Asset Management Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Matt Hougan believes that the narrowing price swings of Bitcoin over the past decade may also render the other argument obsolete at some point. For him, BTC is now synchronizing itself with the elementary demand-supply dynamics in the market. “What’s driving the bitcoin market right now is a simple demand-supply imbalance,” Hougan explained in an interview with CNBC’s ETF Edge. “We have this huge new source of demand from these ETFs, and we have supply that’s inelastic.” Hougan admitted that Bitcoin may not be everyone’s cup of tea though. “It moves around a lot,” said the Bitwise exec. “Some people find it difficult to understand.” After a series of new all-time highs (ATH) in consecutive weeks, Bitcoin prices appeared to be entering into a consolidation phase over the weekend. As of this writing at 5:00 AM UTC on Sunday, BTC is trading at the $66,300 line after exhausting its rally to a new historic high of $73,750.07 three days ago. The current price shows a dip of around 3.77% on the 24-hour chart and 4.66% on the seven-day frame. Nonetheless, zooming out the graphs shows that it’s still up by 27.80% over a month with an astounding 157.41% gain within the year. Trading volume also slumped by 24% as $48.67 worth of BTC moved between wallets and exchanges within the same period. Additionally, the dive to $1.30 trillion in the market cap of Bitcoin’s 19.56 million supply dragged it down to the ninth spot in the world’s top asset by overall valuation next to silver’s $1.43 trillion. The long play for BTC lies in the ever-growing demand for its institutional adoption, particularly triggered by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US as well as the buying sprees of companies and governments. Demand for it will be further amplified when the halving strikes approximately 33 days from now, which will drive down mining rewards from the presently estimated 900 daily BTC production to around 450 BTC a day. On the other hand, MicroStrategy’s much-publicized BTC purchases have always been catalysts for short-term upward movements in Bitcoin’s price. As the company and its executive chair, Michael Saylor, just announced the sale of its $500 million worth of senior notes to grow its 205,000 BTC supply, this is something worth putting in our radars this week."
2024-03-16 17:47:28+00:00,"Spot Bitcoin ETFs Not A Prospect At Vanguard, CEO Affirms",https://blockzeit.com/spot-bitcoin-etfs-not-a-prospect-at-vanguard-ceo-affirms/,"Vanguard Group CEO Mortimer Buckley has confirmed that the company has no plans of offering spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to Buckley, Bitcoin is very speculative and volatile and does not belong in a long-term portfolio. Vanguard is one of the largest ETF issuers with over $2 trillion in AUM (Assets Under Management) and has defied popular expectation that it will apply with the SEC to become one of the top Bitcoin ETF issuers. In an interview, CEO Buckley said they’ve been getting questions about whether they’ve changed their minds about the spot Bitcoin ETFs and “what would it take for you to change your mind?” In response to that Buckley maintained that the company does not have spot Bitcoin ETFs in its prospects and will not change their mind on the product. “We don’t plan to and… we are not going to change our minds around this unless the asset class changes.” Vanguard’s lack of interest in the spot Bitcoin ETF is due to the nature of the underlying asset. That explains why Buckley interjects before adding that “we don’t believe…a Bitcoin ETF belongs in a long-term portfolio.” “It is a speculative asset and funds that we offer invest in asset classes that actually have underlying cash flow.” He also compared Bitcoin to asset classes like stocks and bonds. According to him, with stocks you buy the deferred earnings of a company while bonds pay you interest for lending money.  “They both can be valued,” says Buckley but something like Bitcoin is just too volatile and is not a store of value, hasn’t been. It is speculative, really hard to think about how it belongs to a long-term portfolio.” Vanguard has always made it clear that they are conservative about their investment in cryptocurrency asset classes. In a Q&A earlier this year, Janel Jackson its Global Head of ETF Capital Markets had already said the company “has no plans” to launch a Bitcoin ETF or any other crypto-telated products.  According to Jackson, the company considers whether a potential investment will have “enduring investment merit and meet our clients’ needs.” The company doesn’t see Bitcoin ETFs as a profitable long-term investment for its clients as it maintains a traditional client-first investment portfolio. However, it may come as a shock that a company that views crypto as more of a speculation than an investment has invested over $560 million in Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain both of which are Bitcoin mining companies. Vanguard has acquired $280.5 million in MARA (Marathon Digital) shares and $281 million in Riot Blockchain shares.  This massive acquisition of over half a billion in Bitcoin mining shares appears like a significant discrepancy between Vanguard’s public position on crypto-backed assets and the company’s action. Meanwhile, despite the company’s CEO’s affirmation of no plans for Bitcoin ETFs, a reconsideration is still possible according to a 2021 Vanguard article titled “Cryptocurrencies and Vanguard: what we think.” “As cryptocurrencies and blockchain become increasingly mainstream, we’ll continue to monitor their development and discern the best path forward for our investors,” said Vanguard."
2024-03-16 06:49:02+00:00,El Salvador To Buy Bitcoin Until It “Becomes Unaffordable With Fiat”,https://blockzeit.com/el-salvador-to-buy-bitcoin-until-it-becomes-unaffordable-with-fiat/,"El Salvador remains bullish about Bitcoin as it just increased its holdings to $407 million based on Reuters. The recent purchase was made this week as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap reached a new all-time high of $73,750.07. President Nayib Bukele revealed that they will be keeping a “big chunk” of the nation’s BTC haul in a cold storage wallet, which will be protected within a physical vault. El Salvador was the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender in September 2021. The Central American country’s initial purchase of BTC wasn’t clear but it reportedly began at the same time it made the historic announcement. According to President Nayib Bukele, their government will buy one unit of the crypto asset daily. There hasn’t been much clarity about the extent of this buying spree though, but he said it will be until “Bitcoin becomes unaffordable with fiat currencies.” This continues until #Bitcoin becomes unaffordable with fiat currencies. https://t.co/nzeynjXcFk However, if the information on Nayib Bukele Portfolio Tracker is more accurate, El Salvador may already be sitting on a 5,690 BTC treasure trove with an average purchase price of $42,640.97. Doing the math, its overall investment may be around $242.63 million. As of this writing at 6:00 AM UTC on Saturday, that supply would amount to $392.61 million, which would have already profited El Salvador $149.98 million. Meanwhile, if it sold exactly at the latest ATH, its investment would have grown to 419.64 million, which would have profited the nation $177.01 million. Bitcoin appears to be moving on a consolidation phase around $69,000. Nevertheless, it’s still up over 2% on the 24-hour chart, 1% on the seven-day frame, 32% within a month, and a whopping 182% in the past year. Interestingly, the trading volume of the cryptocurrency was down by 16% on the same period as $62.58 billion worth of its supply moved between wallets and exchanges. The same span saw its price hover between a $65,630.69 low and a $70,557.61 high. The dip puts the overall valuation of BTC’s circulating supply of around 19.66 million down to $1.36 trillion. This allowed silver to reclaim the eighth spot among the top assets in the world by market cap at $1.43 trillion as Bitcoin slid to ninth today."
2024-03-15 12:37:16+00:00,Top 7 Countries Holding The Most Bitcoin (BTC),https://blockzeit.com/top-7-countries-holding-the-most-bitcoin-btc/,"Bitcoin has become a global sensation these past few months of 2024 after the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. The price of BTC rallied higher and broke its all-time high price, weeks before its fourth halving event.  Since the popularity of Bitcoin has exponentially increased, it is important to know how far Bitcoin adoption has reached globally.  Let’s explore which countries own the largest amount of Bitcoin, both citizens and the governments combined. The United States is by far the largest economy in the world. The minimum wage in the U.S.A. has risen to over $100 with the rise in the cost of living in the nation. As of February 2024, about 50 million American citizens own Bitcoin. This number was arrived at based on around 50 million unique addresses that have a non-zero balance of Bitcoin. The U.S. government is also rumored to hold Bitcoin to the tune of more than $8.3 billion, making it the largest. This Bitcoin was seized from Silk Road, and the government has been selling it slowly on the open market. Even though China has banned BTC so many times in the past, the Chinese government reportedly holds 194,000 BTC that was recovered from the Plustoken scam in 2019.  The government of China still keeps a tight leash on its citizens when it comes to owning cryptocurrencies. Because of this, Chinese people have to be creative in the ways they use to buy Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer digital form of money and the largely authoritarian China Communist Party (CCP) does not want its citizens to use a form of money that is uncontrollable and ungovernable. However, in September 2023, Chinese courts allowed Bitcoin holders to assert ownership rights and seek legal remedies for crypto-related disputes despite the crypto ban in China. India is a large economy based on the sheer population of the country. The country is fast becoming a crypto hub with most young investors preferring Bitcoin to gold and stocks. Even though the number is smaller than that of the U.S.A., about 7.35% of India’s population own Bitcoin as of February 2024. This is larger than 6.2% for the United States of America. Nigeria has been faced with a lot of heat in the fintech world lately. With Binance, their primary gateway into the crypto world shutting down NGN trading pairs. Nigeria has been left to find other means to onboard the over 200 million citizens onto crypto. The country boasts over 15 million people owning Bitcoin, which makes up 7.6% of the total population that holds BTC. Brazil has been at the forefront of the global financial revolution spearheaded by the BRICS coalition.  41% of Brazilians own cryptocurrency with 45% of the people saying they plan to purchase crypto coins in the future. Bitcoin is one of the popular cryptocurrencies in Brazil and over 14 million Brazilians own it. This comprises 6.7% of the nation’s population. Singapore is one of the largest crypto hubs in the world. Their regulations provide an environment for cryptocurrencies to thrive.  30% of the people of Singapore have cryptocurrencies with the top three most owned currencies in Singapore including Bitcoin (44.2%), Ethereum (43.5%), and Solana (23.4%). 6.1% of the Singaporean population owns Bitcoin as of February 2024. After facing global financial sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine, Russia turned to cryptocurrencies as a haven. Even though Russia is a large country the population is lower than that of China and India.  As of April 2023, Russia was the second biggest Bitcoin miner after the United States, and concurrently, 14.6 million Russians own Bitcoin. This number comprises 10.1% of the Russian population. World events have unfolded in an interesting way since the previous Bitcoin halving in 2020. These events have led to the greater adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) by governments such as El Salvador and multi-national asset investment firms such as MicroStrategy. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January was the hallmark of this journey of adoption. So far over $50 billion in volume has been traded in these ETF products. Trillion-dollar hedge funds such as BlackRock and Fidelity are at the forefront of offering low-fee Bitcoin ETF products to American citizens. All this is happening pre-BTChaving and setting up the stage for one of the wildest Bitcoin bull markets in the history of cryptocurrencies. The countries named here are just some of the leading nations to hold Bitcoin as of February 2024. This list can change as the global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies evolves. After Bitcoin supply halves, Bitcoin will quickly become mainstream, leading to the onboarding of a larger percentage of the global population not exposed to cryptocurrencies. Investors may want to hold some Bitcoin before mass adoption hits the market."
2024-03-15 11:58:22+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Hits An All-Time High Of $73,794, Bears Threaten To Take Over The Market",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-hits-ath-of-73794-bears-threaten-to-take-over/,"Bitcoin market cap dominance increased this week from 49.2% to 49.4%. The tiny increase signifies that volume is moving from Bitcoin into other chains. Bitcoin’s market grew by $16 billion in comparison. This metric may indicate a full-blown alt season over the next couple of weeks, Already we have seen Binance Coin (BNB) and Solana (SOL) leading the charge, rising by double-digit percentages. Last week Bitcoin price showed promise of reaching $77,000. Experts were still bullish on it and indicators concurred.  The price had hit a small amount at $69,356 forming a local top. But the bulls were coming in for another test at the resistance level.  A strong bullish momentum saw the price slice through this barrier and Bitcoin finally, for the time in its history, hit $70,000. The asset went ahead to establish a new all-time high price at $73,794. However, it did not reach our pivot target of $77,000. $73,794 marked the top for Bitcoin (BTC) as a rounded top formed on the 4-hour chart, and bears pushed the price lower to $65,569. There is a strong bearish momentum currently underway on the Bitcoin chat. The price action has sliced through the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which sets a bearish precedence for Bitcoin. The next support areas below the 50-day SMA are $62,000 and $59,000. The blue band on the chart also happens to coincide with the 200-day SMA, which is known to be very strong support or resistance, depending on which side the price action is approaching. Between the current price of $67,804 and $62,000, there is only one weak support in the $65,000  area. Over the next few days, expect to see Bitcoin retracement increase to the $65,000, or to the $62,000, or to the $59,000 level. If Bitcoin’s price breaks below $59,000, this indicates a market reversal, and we would be in a bearish market. If the supports hold well, BTC may bounce and reach $77,000, even $83,000 if the bullish momentum is strong.

2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."

The verdict is expected to put a stop to Wright’s constant harassment of developers and community members within the BTC ecosystem. It should be recalled that he was responsible for suing several people as he vehemently claimed ownership over the intellectual rights of Bitcoin’s underlying technology. The COPA listed down the following factors which didn’t add up to Wright’s claim that he was Satoshi Nakamoto: The conclusion of the COPA v. Craig Wright case is definitely a welcome development not only for the Bitcoin community but for the overall cryptocurrency industry. It also helps preserve the integrity and anonymity of the individual or group behind the “Satoshi Nakamoto” moniker who seemingly sacrificed all the promises of fame and fortune just to fully realize the decentralized vision of Bitcoin."
2024-03-14 06:53:57+00:00,MicroStrategy Is Looking To Buy More Bitcoin From Sale Of $500 Million Convertible Senior Notes,https://blockzeit.com/microstrategy-to-buy-more-bitcoin-from-sale-of-500m-notes/,"MicroStrategy Announces Proposed Private Offering of $500 Million of Convertible Senior Notes $MSTR https://t.co/nRxijBHsgX The company co-founded by Michael Saylor does not seem to care whether Bitcoin is at its critical peak or dipping. It has set its sights on buying more BTC at every chance it could get. Recently, the company announced its proposed private offering of $500 million convertible senior notes to acquire more of the digital asset and to be used for “general corporate purposes.” The financial instruments will be sold to institutional buyers allowed by Rule 144A of the US Securities Act. The convertible senior notes will be unsecured with semi-annual interest. Their conversion price will be determined based on the US composite volume weighted average price of the company’s class A common stock between 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EDT on March 15. The sale comes right after MicroStrategy acquired an $800 million convertible debt, which was originally planned at $600 million, to purchase 12,000 BTC worth around $68,477. This makes the company one of the biggest whales in the Bitcoin ecosystem with an overall supply of 205,000 BTC as of March 10. Following the latest Bitcoin top-up of MicroStrategy, the digital asset has since built up momentum to conquer new all-time highs. Around two hours ago, BTC once again reached a new historic peak of $73,641.04. As of this writing at 6:30 AM UTC, Bitcoin is trading within a solid spot at $73,500—teasing another possible record. There are currently 19.65 BTC in circulation with a rounded-off market cap of $1.45 trillion. This puts it $30 billion above the overall market cap of silver, making it the eighth-largest asset in the world by market cap and the second-largest decentralized asset globally next to gold. Doing the math, the present summit of BTC prices should have already pushed the original Bitcoin investment of MicroStrategy from $6.91 billion to $15.1 billion. But then again, this doesn’t seem to matter for the people there as the planned sale of convertible notes is another indication that they are not looking to sell the company’s crypto haul anytime soon. The crypto community is on the lookout for another surge in Bitcoin price upon the completion of MicroStrategy’s upcoming BTC acquisition. This likewise serves as an assurance of the strong institutional demand for the digital commodity amid worries of a potentially massive correction before or immediately after the halving."
2024-03-13 11:31:46+00:00,The Current Bitcoin Market: Analysis and Outlook After the New All-Time High,https://blockzeit.com/the-current-bitcoin-market-analysis-and-outlook-after-the-new-all-time-high/,"With the rapid rise of Bitcoin in recent weeks and the new all-time high of $72,850.71, new challenges and questions have also arisen. How will the market continue to develop? What are the risks and opportunities for investors? And what role do technical indicators and market signals play in this dynamic environment? These questions are crucial to understanding the current situation and possible future developments in the Bitcoin market. Below is a comprehensive look at the current market dynamics, analyzing key signals and indicators and highlighting the importance of effective risk management to help investors navigate the volatile world of Bitcoin. Recently, the Bitcoin market has experienced a remarkable rally that has excited investors and market observers alike. The price of Bitcoin broke all previous highs and reached new peaks, leading to a general market euphoria. This upswing raises the important question of whether this trend will continue and what the driving forces behind this development are. Bitcoin’s recent upward trend can be explained by a combination of speculative interest, increasing acceptance of crypto assets as a means of investment and payment, and positive market sentiment. The breaking of important psychological barriers, such as certain price levels, has led to increased investment activity and speculation. This effect is amplified by so-called “FOMO” (Fear Of Missing Out) buying, where investors enter the market for fear of missing out on a profitable development. In recent weeks, Bitcoin has staged a remarkable rally that has sent the entire crypto market into a frenzy. Not only has the cryptocurrency broken through historic highs, it has also surpassed the market capitalization of traditional assets such as silver. This development begs the question: What is driving this incredible rise? One of the main reasons for the recent price explosion is the increasing interest of institutional investors. Major financial players who were previously sceptical about crypto assets are now recognizing the potential of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and as part of a diversified investment strategy. In addition, the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a means of payment and positive media coverage are playing a role in boosting confidence in the digital currency. Related: Bitcoin: A Detailed Analysis Of The Current Situation And A Guide To Future-Oriented Investment Strategies The involvement of institutional investors has heralded a new phase in Bitcoin’s development. The announcement by major companies to include Bitcoin on their balance sheets, as well as the launch of Bitcoin ETFs and other investment products, has sparked interest from both retail and institutional investors. This development suggests that Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a legitimate asset class, leading to wider acceptance and integration into the traditional financial system. Another factor favoring the rise of Bitcoin is the search for high-yielding investments in a low interest rate environment. As traditional forms of investment such as government bonds and fixed-term deposit accounts currently offer little return, investors are increasingly turning to alternative investments to diversify their portfolios and achieve higher returns. A key factor supporting the ongoing upswing is the behavior of market participants with regard to technical indicators. The analysis of price candles and their formations, in particular the observation of wicks, provides information about buying and selling pressure in the market. For example, a long wick at the top of a candle signals strong selling pressure, while a long wick at the bottom indicates buying interest. This information is key to understanding market dynamics and future price trends. The Stochastic Relative Strength Index (Stochastic RSI), a popular tool among crypto investors, plays an essential role in assessing the current market momentum. An upward sloping Stochastic RSI suggests continued upward momentum, which can be an indicator that the current upswing may continue. Monitoring this indicator in conjunction with other technical analysis tools provides investors with valuable insight into potential future price movements. The division of the market into different phases, such as the so-called “phase 3” of the bull market, which is characterized by the crossing of certain resistance lines in the RSI, helps to assess the market situation. Entry into this phase often signals increased volatility and a possible acceleration of the upward trend. These market phases are of particular interest to investors as they provide information about the state of the market and potential future developments. Risk management plays a crucial role in the long-term success of investments in Bitcoin. Given the high volatility of the market, it is important to pursue a balanced strategy that includes both securing profits and protecting against major losses. This also includes diversifying the portfolio to spread the risk. While the current trend offers many opportunities, it is essential to be cautious and not blindly bet on an uninterrupted continuation of the uptrend. Instead, investors should make informed decisions based on a thorough analysis of the market and its potential directions. Related: Bitcoin Revolution: How The Digital Gold Era Is Turning The Financial World Upside Down – A Comprehensive Analysis The rise of Bitcoin to new highs has fascinated the financial world and at the same time posed new challenges. The market is showing unprecedented momentum, driven by increasing acceptance among investors and the search for alternative investments. While technical indicators such as the Stochastic RSI are sending positive signals, overbought conditions are a reminder of the need for prudent risk management. For investors, this means that while they should take advantage of the current opportunities, they should not lose sight of the potential risks. A balanced investment strategy that relies on both sound market analysis and a diversified portfolio appears to be the key to success in such a volatile environment. The outlook for Bitcoin remains exciting and uncertain. On the one hand, increasing institutional acceptance and integration into traditional financial products such as ETFs could provide further impetus. On the other hand, regulatory developments or macroeconomic changes could influence the market. Ultimately, investors who are both flexible and informed will be best positioned to take advantage of the opportunities and manage the risks. In summary, the Bitcoin market is currently going through a period of strong momentum, with both significant opportunities for profit and risks. Prudent risk management and sound market analysis are crucial in order to benefit from current developments and at the same time hedge the portfolio against unforeseen market fluctuations. The future of Bitcoin remains exciting, and investors who keep an eye on both the opportunities and the risks are best positioned to succeed in this dynamic market environment. Finally, Bitcoin is at a potentially pivotal turning point in its history. Although the future remains uncertain, it is clear that Bitcoin and crypto-assets as a whole will play an increasingly important role in the global financial system. Investors willing to adapt to this new reality could find themselves in an advantageous position to benefit from the developments ahead. Ed Prinz is co-founder and CEO of https://loob.io.

2024-03-13 11:25:51+00:00,"Bitcoin Hits Another ATH At $73.64K, Is It Heading To $100K?",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-hits-another-ath-at-73-64k-is-it-heading-to-100k/,"The prospect of Bitcoin passing the $70K line used to be a ‘meh’ for pundits since the long crypto winter in the past few years erased most of its gains from 2021. However, as the leading cryptocurrency by market cap passed that point to the current $73.64K all-time high (ATH), some have shifted their sights on it. Now, the previous predictions of $100K to $200K per Bitcoin no longer feel like a shot to the moon as the digital asset continues to maintain a strong bullish momentum on the way to its historic halving. But where is BTC heading next? Bitcoin rose over 2% on the 24-hour chart with a new all-time high of $73,637.47 around 8:00 AM UTC today after a short dip at $68,728.85 last night. As of this writing at 10:00 AM, it is standing its ground above $73,200. The same frame saw its trading volume spike by 16% as $64.04 billion worth of BTC changed hands between wallets and exchanges. Meanwhile, the 19.65 million circulating supply of the virtual currency is now worth $1.44 trillion, which is already more than $60 billion above silver’s market cap. Financial analysts in the crypto sector firmly believe that Bitcoin has plenty of rocket fuel left for its journey up. With that, the $100K target is becoming imminent. But then again, the consensus doubts it would come before the halving. Bitcoin’s steep climb in the past few weeks to the recent ATH is ringing some alarm bells. Rekt Capital, in particular, claimed that its market is now showing heavy signs of overheating. Looking also at the behavior of the crypto asset during the past epochs where it fell by 20% prior to the 2020 halving and retraced by 38% in 2016 pre-halving, the one happening before April’s halving hits may be no different. If there’s any consolation, the upcoming pre-halving dips may no longer be as hard as the previous ones as the gradually growing institutional demand for Bitcoin may cushion the dive. Should Bitcoin emulate the first few months of the previous two post-halving cycles, the momentum could bring it somewhere between $100K and $300K according to Ecoinometrics."
2024-03-13 04:59:29+00:00,El Salvador Makes Over $83 Million In Profits Amidst Bitcoin Boom,https://blockzeit.com/el-salvador-makes-over-83-million-in-profits-amidst-bitcoin-boom/,"El Salvador is currently swimming in massive profits following Bitcoin’s Recent surge past $72,000. The Central American country has gained over $83.9 million from its Bitcoin reserve after making the revolutionary move to adopt the cryptocurrency as its legal tender back in 2021. The country has ridden with Bitcoin through the dips and is bountifully reaping the rewards of its unwavering belief in Bitcoin. El Salvador, technically the most Bitcoin-friendly country has its Bitcoin reserve in 66% gains which equals a whopping $83 million. The country has been at the forefront of the crypto revolution and was the first to go all-in on a national level.  Under the government of its current president Nayib Bukele, the country acquired over $121 million or 2,861 BTC between September 2021 and November 2022. The purchase comprised 12 installments at an average dollar cost of $42,599 per BTC.  The country defied the dwindles in the value of Bitcoin within the past two years, instead using the dips as opportunities to scoop up more BTC and enrich its reserve. Fast forward to less than three years later, its faith in Bitcoin’s prospects has paid off with its portfolio now worth over $203 million.  President Bukele has been the subject of public scrutiny because of his Bitcoin-centric financial system, which many analysts and large news outlets like the Economist believed was an easy route to financial doom. When Bitcoin initially started pumping and sent El Salvador’s  profits to 40%, Bukele, referring  to those outlets said that “when #Bitcoin’s market price was low, they wrote literally thousands of articles about our supposed losses.” “We won’t sell, or course; at the end 1 BTC = 1 BTC (this was true when the market price was low and it’s true now); but it’s very telling that the authors of those hit pieces, the “analysts”, the “experts”, the “journalists”, are totally silent now.” While El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings bring it tens of millions in profits, it’s worth knowing that the country has alternative sources of Bitcoin revenue that are also as lucrative. President Bukele via a tweet, reminded the world that his country doesn’t just depend on the Bitcoin reserve; there are other revenue structures built around Bitcoin, that also contribute to the country’s economy. El Salvador runs one of the world’s largest bitcoin mining farms which runs on the country’s renewable geothermal energy. The mining project was launched in October 2023 and intended to harness the country’s volcanoes to mine bitcoin, which in turn will earn the country Bitcoins. The country also launched a Citizenship by Investment Program that allows any foreigner to donate Bitcoin to the country and become a citizen. By donating about $1 million in Bitcoin or USDT, people of other nationalities can obtain the Salvadorian Freedom Passport and become citizens within 6 weeks. This citizenship program is open to about 1,000 applicants annually and should tremendously boost the country’s economy. Bukele also said his country also earns BTC revenue “from government services.” Additionally, more cash inflows come “from converting BTC to USDT for local businesses.” Within five years of becoming El Salvador’s president, Bukele has completely transformed the country’s economy and is also lauded for bringing the country’s murder rate to an all-time low. "
2024-03-12 14:18:19+00:00,Bitcoin Ordinals Are Gaining Ground: Here’s Why!,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-ordinals-gaining-ground/,"Bitcoin Ordinals are among the trendiest and most revolutionary innovations in the current Web3 landscape. Since their introduction in January 2023, the crypto world has been abuzz with discussions for and against these additions to the Bitcoin ecosystem.  Read on to learn what Bitcoin Ordinals are, how they work, and why they’re becoming so popular. Bitcoin Ordinals are digital assets native to the Bitcoin network. Also known as Ordinal inscriptions, they are created by inscribing data to individual satoshis, the smallest unit on the Bitcoin blockchain.  You could think of them as non-fungible tokens on Bitcoin.  The Ordinals protocol allows you to add images, text, video, and other digital assets on satoshis. You can also inscribe data featuring smart contracts, which can represent NFTs. This capability opens up Bitcoin Ordinals to a wide range of use cases, as we’ll soon uncover. Bitcoin Ordinals use a special mechanism, inscription, to add unique data to satoshis once mined. Inscriptions made on satoshis follow the order in which they are mined, creating unique inscribed sats, which are then stored in the Bitcoin blockchain’s blocks.  Consequently, Bitcoin Ordinals benefit from the security, durability, and immutability of Bitcoin itself. This marks the key difference between Bitcoin Ordinals and traditional NFTs. With traditional NFTs, data related to the token is kept off-chain, which places it at risk of unauthorized access. Information is kept in the witness section of a Bitcoin transaction during inscription. The witness section was launched during the 2017 Segregated Witness upgrade (SegWit upgrade), which split the Bitcoin transaction data structure into two portions, i.e., transaction and witness. The move increased transaction data efficiency. The inscription technique resulted from the Taproot upgrade introduced into the Bitcoin network in November 2021. Meanwhile, the Ordinals protocol launched by developer Casey Rodarmor relies on the Ordinal Theory, a numbering system that permits the protocol to identify, track, and trade inscribed satoshis. You can also transfer inscriptions to standard Bitcoin addresses.  Bitcoin Ordinals present a revolutionary way to store data. This aside, they offer several other benefits, including: Bitcoin Ordinals have become increasingly popular as they provide new and unique use cases for the Bitcoin network. Here are some excellent examples. Identify a reputable Ordinal wallet, such as the Xverse Bitcoin Inscriptions Wallet, to securely manage your Ordinal inscriptions. It features a user-friendly interface, seamless sending and receiving of Bitcoin Ordinals, and wallet connection to Ordinals marketplaces, enabling you to buy and sell Bitcoin Ordinals. With Bitcoin Ordinals, users can inscribe different types of data onto the Bitcoin blockchain, creating a new market for on-chain Bitcoin NFTs, meme-inspired Bitcoin NFT collections, and other digital assets."
2024-03-12 12:19:37+00:00,"Bitcoin Surpasses $72,000, Hut 8 Mining Corp. Closes Drumheller Mining Site",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-surpasses-72000-hut-8-mining-corp-closes-drumheller-mining-site/,"The Drumheller mining site contributed approximately 11% of Hut 8’s hashrate toward Bitcoin production. The site has been deemed unprofitable due to elevated energy costs and underlying voltage issues. The closure is effective immediately, with the company’s Bitcoin miners shipping back to its Medicine Hat facility, which boasts superior infrastructure and economics. Hut 8’s CEO, Asher Genoot, stated that the closure is part of a comprehensive restructuring plan to drive maximum value from the company’s assets and position it for profitable growth. Despite the nominal lease expense, Hut 8 retains the option to re-energize the Drumheller site if market conditions improve, such as a decrease in energy rates on the AESO grid or an increase in hash price. Even though the closure of the mining site seems like a bad decision, the move will enhance Hut 8’s cash flow, reduce its cost to mine a Bitcoin, and drive an increase in Bitcoin mined per EH of approximately 11%. Electricity prices per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in Alberta have increased by 1,000% since 2017, prompting the provincial government to restrict new cryptocurrency mining projects over concerns about power usage. For the first nine months of 2023, Hut 8’s revenue fell by 57% year-over-year, largely due to falling Bitcoin prices at the time. This move is strategic because it comes during a time when the Bitcoin mining sector is facing stagnation due to high energy costs, record mining difficulty, and the anticipated Bitcoin halving, which will reduce mining rewards by 50%. BTC made history, breaking above $72,000 for the first time in history. Moreover, it is also the first time for Bitcoin to establish ATH prices before the halving. This sets a precedence for an extremely bullish supercycle for Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market.  Some experts believe that another bull run like this could only have happened 100 years ago, and hence an extremely rare opportunity to profit off the markets."
2024-03-12 10:31:15+00:00,London Stock Exchange Will Begin Accepting Bitcoin and Ethereum ETNs By Q2 2024,https://blockzeit.com/london-stock-exchange-will-begin-accepting-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etns-by-q2-2024/,"In yet another milestone for the cryptocurrency community, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) declared via a press release on Monday that it will not get in the way of requests for crypto ETNs (cETNs) and crypto derivatives by Recognized Investment Exchanges (RIEs). Following this, the LSE stated that it will start accepting Bitcoin and Ethereum ETNs by Q2. There are, however, some conditions set by the FCA for the crypto ETN filings to safeguard investors. Besides coming from UK RIEs and having structured controls in place, the investment instrument should only be limited to institutional or professional investors such as investment and credit firms. This is in line with the ban on retail consumers’ participation in regulated crypto exchanges imposed in 2020. The regulator warned, “cETNs and crypto derivatives are ill-suited for retail consumers due to the harm they pose.” It goes on to remind people about the risks that crypto assets pose, saying, “Those who invest should be prepared to lose all their money.” As an assurance of its commitment to protecting public interest, the FCA assured that it is partnering up with government, international, and industry partners to forge better standards in the UK’s regulatory regime. Meanwhile, the LSE listing is only limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETNs. It also comes with the condition that they should be physically backed and non-leveraged. “The decision by the FCA and the LSE to accept crypto ETP applications signals a very encouraging shift in the regulatory landscape in the UK,” said Mandy Chiu, 21Shares head of financial product development in an interview. On the other side of the globe, spot Bitcoin ETFs have rallied after their underlying asset, BTC, achieved another all-time high at $72,850.71. Based on the March 11 tally, the total net inflows in the sector was at $505.6 million. Leading the charge were BlackRock’s IBIT with $562.9 million and Fidelity’s FBTC with $215.5 million net inflows. Large withdrawals from Grayscale’s GBTC were the major deal-breaker during the last trading day with around $494.1 million leaving its coffers."

Not only did the company buy near the top, but it also timed it on the same day the digital asset recorded a new all-time high (ATH) above $72K. In an interview with CNBC right after the daring move, MSTR Co-Founder and Executive Chair Michael Saylor confidently declared his belief that the value of Bitcoin will continue to gain traction. It will go to the point that it will eventually overtake gold. “Bitcoin is certainly at least digital gold, it’s going to eat gold,” said Saylor. “It’s got all of the great attributes of gold and it’s got none of the defects of gold.” By design, Bitcoin was supposedly an alternative to Fiat currency in payment systems. However, its valuation has grown to the point that its use case has been transformed into a store of value like gold. The digital asset also possesses the same fungible, scarce, and decentralized nature of the precious metal. What elevates BTC though is the exponential rise of its price because of certain advantages it has compared to gold that drives its demand. Saylor explained that, unlike gold, Bitcoin could be moved from one place to another in just a few minutes and can be traded 27/4. With that, he expects BTC to direct funds further away from other risk assets like the SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) exchange-traded fund (ETF). Meanwhile, the recent filing of BlackRock to purchase spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) for its Global Allocation Fund is foreseen as a catalyst for similar efforts in other investment managers. #Bitcoin is Digital Property. It is superior to other investments such as Gold, Equity, or Real Estate because it is digital, available, global, ethical, & useful to millions of companies and billions of people. pic.twitter.com/738dblB0Zt The latest peak of Bitcoin came at $72,850.71 today. With its circulating supply at 19.65 million BTC, the overall market cap of the crypto asset also topped at $1.432 trillion, making it the 8th largest asset in the world by market cap. In contrast, gold has a market cap of $14.653 trillion at $2,178 per troy ounce. MicroStrategy’s investment in Bitcoin as of March 10 is at $6.91 billion. During BTC’s ATH, the firm could’ve already profited an easy $8.02 billion. But then again, we don’t see them selling anytime soon."

The funds used for the purchase came from MicroStrategy’s convertible notes and excess cash. MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 12,000 BTC for ~$821.7M using proceeds from convertible notes & excess cash for ~$68,477 per #bitcoin. As of 3/10/24, $MSTR hodls 205,000 $BTC acquired for ~$6.91B at average price of $33,706 per bitcoin. https://t.co/YayyKtpz8d As of March 10, 2024, the Bitcoin development company holds a total supply of 205,000 BTC acquired for $6.91 billion at an average price of $33,706 per BTC. The recent procurement of MicroStrategy amid the peaking prices of Bitcoin only goes on to show its confidence in the potential of Bitcoin as the money of the future and its unwavering commitment as a Bitcoin development company. It also reinforces Saylor’s word that they have no plans of selling despite the allure of already getting more than double their investment if they sold at the digital asset’s series of historic highs in the past couple of days. Prior to Bitcoin’s new all-time high (ATH), MicroStrategy held 193,000 BTC out of a $6.09 billion investment. If it sold during the coin’s initial climb to $71K, that would have meant a profit of around $7.61 billion. Thanks to the diamond hands of Saylor and his team, however, MSTR’s current $6.91 billion investment for 205,000 BTC improved their unrealized profits by over $7.9 billion at the prevailing price of $72K per BTC. Barely an hour after it touched its ATH today, Bitcoin seems to have established its footing at the $71,500 line. This strong base lets it keep its $1.41 trillion market cap, which is $30 million more than silver’s overall valuation. Given that there are 37 days more to go until the halving, coupled with the strong demand for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, it remains to be seen whether or not Bitcoin still has more juice left in the tank for a further rally from here. With the way things are going right now though, the show is unlikely over yet."
2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."

The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."

With the network’s algorithm triggering yet another level of scarcity in the world’s leading cryptocurrency by market cap, more investors are now very bullish on BTC’s potential to reach a new top anytime between this year and the next from the current $73,750.07 peak. Exclusive: Victory Securities internally released the Hong Kong Bitcoin Ethereum spot ETF subscription guide and disclosed its charging standards. Hong Kong securities firms are selling to potential clients.The original text of the picture is in Chinese, using Google Translate… pic.twitter.com/oCqlU6EoSm Alongside them are the spot Bitcoin ETF issuers in the US as they look to capitalize on BTC’s tighter supply, which could result in a new price discovery for the digital asset. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF is particularly enjoying an unprecedented success as it displayed 69 days of unbroken chain of inflows despite the outflows overpowering the market on most days of the week preceding the halving. Last Friday, IBIT recorded $29.3 million in inflows to raise its issuer’s net inflows to $15.42 billion. The company credited the strong performance of its spot Bitcoin ETF, especially with institutional investors, to its strong branding, competitive fee, and strategic distribution. With that, there’s anticipation that BlackRock’s exchange-traded product (ETP) would eventually surpass Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) in assets under management (AUM) under ETFs. In contrast to IBIT, GBTC has logged an alarming $16.73 billion net outflows since its ETF conversion on January 11. Elsewhere, the Securities & Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong (HK) reportedly greenlit several Chinese spot Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs last week but the regulator has yet to give an official announcement regarding the matter. Amid the silence of the agency on the subject, big institutional players like China Asset Management, Harvest Fund, Bosera, and HashKey have begun leaking tidbits of information regarding the approval of their ETF applications. The last two, however, only revealed conditional approval for their ETPs. One of the new names that surfaced in this space is Hong Kong’s Victory Securities. According to Wu Blockchain on X, the issuer will charge 0.5% to 1% of the customer’s total transaction with a minimum fee set at $850. Meanwhile, secondary markets will be charged 0.15% for online transactions and 0.25% for phone transactions.

From the looks of it, other players in the area will unlikely stray farther from these numbers. For Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the Hong Kong spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are setting up more bullish sentiment for the wider crypto market. However, he doused expectations that they would match or perform better than their US counterparts. Balchunas explained that the HK ETF market is relatively small, with an estimated capitalization of $50 billion. He also criticized their limited access due to the crypto ban holding back investors from mainland China. The analyst said the HK crypto ETFs would be lucky to even reach $500 million in inflows."

This means lower rewards for miners within its ecosystem going forward, or a prize of 3.125 BTC per block in the next four years from the last cycle’s 6.25 BTC. Except for the morning prior to the critical juncture in its economy, the halving didn’t bring in a dramatic price movement for Bitcoin. However, against the backdrop of the event was something more exciting happening within the BTC space. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU During the affair, transaction fees spiked as Bitcoin mining operators competed to secure the historic 840,000th block, which served as a bridge between the outgoing and incoming cycles this year. According to mempool, the coveted block eventually fell into the hands of ViaBTC, but it didn’t come without a high gamble. On-chain data revealed miners actually spent a whopping total of $37.67 BTC in mining fees for a chance to get the sought-after block. That’s roughly $2.4 million at the going rate of BTC on Saturday midnight, making it the highest fee paid for a single block on the Bitcoin network. In addition to the fees, ViaBTC bagged 40.7 BTC as a bounty for the 840,000th block, or around $2.6 million. Without hindsight, the high transaction fees may have been too impractical considering the rewards and competition in the space. However, within the 840,000th block lay the possibility of acquiring special satoshis (sats). In a nutshell, a sat is the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Each sat is equivalent to 0.00000001 BTC. Every halving paves the way for “epic sats,” which are considered to be rare artifacts within Bitcoin that are potentially worth millions of dollars. #Bitcoin (#BTC) miners are gearing up to mine the “#EpicSat,” which could fetch millions of dollars.The ultra-rare #satoshi (sat) could come from the first block generated after the halving.https://t.co/usb0EUK0sW Another milestone achieved during the halving was the advent of Runes. This is basically a new token standard on Bitcoin created by Casey Rodarmor, the person behind the Ordinals launched last year. #Runes protocol is launching on April 20, 2024, immediately after #Bitcoinhalving.Runes will perform better than Ordinals but the impact on #Bitcoin fees could be higher.Several pre-rune ordinal projects will be airdropping to rune holders.@soldout_vin https://t.co/wJQf5YUTjQ As of this writing at 2:00 AM UTC, there are already 3,246 Runes etched within the Bitcoin network based on RuneAlpha data. Along the line are 46,1245 transactions from 53,476 holders. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is now trading over $65,000 with around a 2% gain on the 24-hour and seven-day charts. It is more than 4% down on the one-month frame but it’s still treading 130% higher in the one-year range."

It marks the second time this month that the largest cryptocurrency by market cap has established a new historical peak. The latest feats of BTC just defied a lot of pundits who preached that February’s top was already the best the digital asset could achieve before halving and those who claimed that the halving has already been priced in. Unlike its previous climb to $70K a few days ago, which almost immediately tanked prices because of the ensuing panic selling from those who wanted to secure their profits, this one may be different. As of this writing almost an hour after the event, Bitcoin seems to be holding the line. This could be a bullish signal indicating further surge. The recent ATH of Bitcoin displays over 2% gain within the 24-hour chart. Remarkably, the world’s leading crypto asset is presently up by more than 245% within the year. The soaring prices were coupled with a spike in trading volume by 84% as $47.769 billion worth of BTC’s 19.651 million supply changed hands between wallets and exchanges. The rise in the digital currency’s value also resulted in a spike of its market cap by a whopping $1.40 trillion, surpassing silver’s $1.381 overall valuation. After topping silver, Bitcoin is now eighth on the list of top assets in the world by market cap and the second-largest decentralized asset globally. Seated above the crypto is Alphabet (Google) with a $286 billion lead. Trailing the Bitcoin bandwagon are Ethereum and other altcoins. The recent developments also pumped Ether prices to a two-year record high of over $4K. The boost comes ahead of the much-awaited Dencun upgrade, which is expected to bring about a slew of new features within the ETH ecosystem. The said update is designed to unlock near-zero fees for Layer-2 platform users as well as a more efficient flow of transactions, security, and scalability within the Ethereum network."
2024-03-11 04:00:00+00:00,Flawed Reasoning Of Bill Ackman About Buying Bitcoin Draws Criticism From MicroStrategy And Riot Platforms,https://blockzeit.com/flawed-reasoning-of-bill-ackman-about-buying-bitcoin-draws-criticism-from-microstrategy-and-riot-platforms/,"Pershing Square Capital Management Founder and CEO Bill Ackman’s recent posts on X got the cryptocurrency community riled up as he pondered buying Bitcoin. The billionaire hedge fund manager was notably known for avoiding cryptocurrencies after his earlier support for Helium left him with a bad taste for his investors. According to Ackman, the rising price of Bitcoin could drive its mining activity, hence, proportionately pushing up energy costs. The latter could then contribute to inflation and devaluate the dollar. The billionaire added that the unending cycle could further pump demand for Bitcoin and energy. He warned the scenario could also play the opposite though. Bill, come visit Rockdale and let’s talk #bitcoin mining economics. There’s a lot of feedback loops, #btc purchasing power can’t go straight up due to wealth effect spending / rebalancing of holders. Ackman’s statements drew the attention of Bitcoiners, and one of them was MicroStrategy Co-Founder and Executive Chair Michael Saylor. The Bitcoin maximalist encouraged the Pershing Square CEO to buy the digital asset, but not for the reasons he mentioned. Saylor clarified that most Bitcoin mining companies nowadays are helping reduce electricity costs for consumers. The MicroStrategy exec said he’s willing to discuss the subject in a 1-on-1 talk with Ackman. Bill, come visit Rockdale and let’s talk #bitcoin mining economics. There’s a lot of feedback loops, #btc purchasing power can’t go straight up due to wealth effect spending / rebalancing of holders. MicroStrategy is now one of the biggest whales in Bitcoin and has since rebranded itself as a Bitcoin development company. As of February 25 this year, the firm has grown its holdings to 193,000 BTC worth around $6.09 billion at an average price of $31,544 per BTC. Today’s price of $68,500 per BTC now puts their investment at $13.22 billion, which is already double the money they poured in at $7.13 billion of unrealized gains. Last week, MicroStrategy announced its private offering of $600 million of convertible senior notes. A portion of the sale’s net proceeds will be allocated to acquire more Bitcoin while the rest will go to corporate uses. Riot Platforms Vice-President of Research Pierre Rochard also threw his hat in the discussion to enlighten Ackman’s misleading analysis. He explained that there are a lot of feedback loops in the subject. In the case of BTC, purchasing power does not shoot straight up because of wealth effect spending or rebalancing of holders. Rochard likewise invited Ackman to visit their Rockdale headquarters so they could have a conversation about Bitcoin mining economics. Bill, come visit Rockdale and let’s talk #bitcoin mining economics.

2024-03-09 06:53:57+00:00,SEC Chair Gary Gensler Compares Bitcoin’s Recent Volatility To A Rollercoaster,https://blockzeit.com/sec-chair-gary-gensler-compares-bitcoins-recent-volatility-to-a-rollercoaster/,"Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission has once again triggered the crypto community with another anti-crypto statement. This time, he called Bitcoin and Ether “highly speculative assets” while comparing the movements of Bitcoin’s price in the last few days to a roller coaster in an interview with Bloomberg’s Joe Mathieu and Kailey Leinz. Chair Gensler recently granted a Bloomberg Interview where he discussed systemic risk, climate rule, and crypto. Towards the end of the interview, Blomberg’s Kailey Leinz raised some questions on the pending Spot Ether ETFs and Gensler and the SEC’s position on whether or not the underlying asset Ether is a security. “Of course, we are now two months into a world in which the spot Bitcoin products exist. They have had incredible demand more than $8 billion in inflows. Now the optimism is Ether Spot ETFs are next. Do you not first have to settle the question of whether Ether is a Security or a Commodity? Can you answer that first,” asked Leinz. Gensler started by saying that what determines whether a crypto token  is a security or not is the facts and circumstances on “whether the investing public is anticipating profit based on the activities of others.” However, Gensler adds that they “do have filings before them” and that he’s not going to comment. He goes on to liken Bitcoin’s volatility in the last two days to a roller coaster.  “You really should be conscious as investing public that this is a bit of a roller coaster ride on these volatile assets,” said Gensler. He also says that thousands of “these tokens” may be securities because the investing public may rely on the efforts of some group of entrepreneurs in the middle of the projects to make a profit. The interviewer then doubled down on her former question now asking whether Gensler considers Ether as part of that group that might be securities. “I understand that you’re asking the question. But again, I’m going to defer on that question,” replied Gensler. There have been great clamours for Gensler’s replacement with a more crypto-savvy and competent SEC Chair who will make more informed and proactive decisions while putting the average American’s interests first. Under Gensler’s regime, Americans were denied access to Spot Bitcoin ETFs until the courts technically forced him to approve them. Gensler’s regime has also fallen out with major cryptocurrency firms and startups, leaving a negative effect on the American FinTech industry. There are also complaints of lack of proper guidance or policy from the agency to the crypto industry.  Considering that President Biden brought Gensler into office, it could favour his presidential bid if he replaces Gensler with someone who fiscal republicans and the crypto industry can relate to. Among the five SEC commissioners, Hester Pierce a.k.a. Crypto Mummy seems to be the most suited to right the SEC’s wrongs because of how closely she identifies with the crypto industry."
2024-03-09 06:44:09+00:00,Bitcoin ATH Triggers Another Massive Profit-Taking But Establishes A Stronger Base This Time,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-ath-triggers-another-massive-profit-taking-but-establishes-a-stronger-base-this-time/,"Bitcoin just touched a new all-time high a few hours ago to $70,083.05 before another massive profit-taking crashed prices at $66,230.45. The dip is notably much higher than Wednesday’s low at around $61,000, which indicates solid optimism by the consensus. As of 5:30 AM UTC, BTC price recovered to around $68,300. Trading volume rose by 32% as $58.18 billion worth of BTC moved between addresses. The new ATH of Bitcoin raised the valuation of its 19.65 million circulating supply briefly to $1.375 trillion before a retracement to the present $1.343 trillion. The peak of BTC today was only $5 billion short of surpassing silver’s market cap. Silver currently ranks ninth among the top assets in the world by market cap while Bitcoin sits tenth. The retracement of BTC price again widened the gap between the two by $37 billion. Interestingly, Bitcoin is the third largest decentralized asset by market next to gold and silver. The ensuing selling pressure was also reflected in the US spot Bitcoin ETF market. After achieving over $648 million in net inflows on March 5 at BTC’s previous ATH, the surprising rally of the digital asset this Friday dropped the net inflows to $223 million. BlackRock’s IBIT still emerged as the best performer with $336.3 million net inflows. The spot Bitcoin ETF market showed significant gains overall but these were offset by the net outflows of Grayscale’s GBTC at $302.9 million and Invesco’s BTCO at $7.6 million. The generally bullish sentiment of the market toward BTC is driven by the growing retail and institutional demand for the asset, which is primarily reflected by the performance of the spot Bitcoin ETF in the US, and the anticipation for the halving expected around 40 days from now. The halving is expected to trigger a new level of scarcity for the asset as block rewards are decreased from the prevailing 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC post-halving amid the strong retail and institutional demand. With only 6,155 blocks remaining on the way to the halving’s predetermined activation at the 840,000th block height, the halving is estimated to happen between April 18 and 20. Although it’s not generating as much noise as the halving, Ethereum’s (ETH) Dencun upgrade next week is likewise projected to drag the cryptocurrency market up with ETH prices possibly pumping over $4,000 during the event. How much it will affect Bitcoin remains to be seen because it may shift focus away from the leading crypto asset, maintain the status quo, or catalyze a short-term “sell the news” event. Nonetheless, other altcoins will likely benefit from the Ether ecosystem update as much as they are capitalizing on the positive price movements of Bitcoin."

Concurrently, BTC established a record market cap of $1.336 trillion. The market cap dominance of BTC is down this week because of the alt season that began Tuesday this week. Altcoins are expected to rally massively for the next three weeks leading to Easter, and subsequently Bitcoin halving week. Last week, Bitcoin witnessed an impressive rally caught in a resistance at $64, 131. The market was greedy and some investors thought BTC would return to $59,000.  Bitcoin did not retrace. Instead, the price action formed a small bullish pennant before breaking higher and hitting record highs of $69,210. This so happens to be Bitcoin’s new all-time high price in history. It is worth noting that in all previous super-cycles, Bitcoin has never surpassed its all-time high pre-halving. Bitcoin price rallied strongly and topped out near our price target of $69,356. However, do not fret because Bitcoin is not done yet. This pivot proved to be a strong resistance point because it coincided with Bitcoin’s previous ATH price.  Similar to what happened around the first pivot ($64,131), Bitcoin bulls got rejected and the price dumped sharply to $58,000 before rising again, resulting in over $750 million worth of BTC longs being liquidated on March 5, 2024. BTC price is currently between $64,131 and $69,356. This zone can quickly become a consolidation zone as we move toward the BTC halving week a month from now.  Should BTC break above $69,356, expect to see a $77,000 BTC fast. However, if bears win the fight and BTC breaks lower than $64,131, then expect to see $58,931, and $53,000. Further sell pressure could push the asset down to $47,000.

The crypto asset also defied expectations when it logged a new record peak of $69,170.63 over 40 days prior to the halving in its ecosystem. Last month, some experts thought the halving event was already priced in while BTC was moving along the $50,000 and $52,000 range. But then again, the digital asset suddenly found a sustained rally by the end of February on the way to its ATH on March 5. Right now, BTC appears to be in a consolidation phase and the dip merely provided an opportunity for investors to stack up more of its supply. With that, it may be primed for another rally, which could culminate in a new historical peak. Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Research, noted that the present trajectory of Bitcoin coincides with the pattern it displayed back in December 2020. Almost a year away from its previous ATH at $68,789, the digital currency tapped its then-ATH at $20,000 twice before ranging and trading down by 11% and eventually breaching the territory to its 2021 top. remember that in dec. 2020, BTC touched its prior all-time high of ~$20k twice, then ranged and traded -11.3% lower over 15 days before definitively breaking ATH likely to look similar here, and some consolidation would be healthy after +62% YTD / +77% from YTD low (jan 23) pic.twitter.com/mkywLKn4FC According to the analyst, Bitcoin is no stranger to dropping over 10% in the past bull cycle. Hence, the current behavior of its values may not be any different from that period. btw more on the “wall of worry” we’ve climbed each of the prior bull runs (jan 17 to dec 17 and mar 20 to apr 21) 👇 https://t.co/2oaRkXN0rN John Bollinger, who is famous for his Bollinger Bands strategy, throws in a bit of caution in the present state of Bitcoin though. For him, the profit-taking was expected, but the one right after BTC’s ATH may have been “a bit much.” So, a failed rally at this point could be disastrous. We expect profit taking at new highs, that is the way of things, but this seems a bit much. Is it leverage, weak hands, or something else? $btcusd In any case, a one-day setback does not a top make. However, a failed rally attempt would be ugly! #BTC Bitcoin didn’t show much action in the 24-hour chart but it remains at the $65,800 mark. Trading volume also slowed by nearly 40% as $60.95 billion worth of BTC moved between addresses. Nevertheless, Bitcoin remains just below silver among the top assets in the world by market cap with the digital currency’s overall value of $1.29 trillion compared to the precious metal’s $1.37 trillion total valuation. Meanwhile, the total net inflows of the top 10 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US slumped by over 50% last Wednesday based on Farside Investors’ data. Nevertheless, they remained at a staggering amount of $332 million. Leading the fray were the usual suspects, BlackRock ($218.7 million) and Fidelity ($205.7 million)."
2024-03-06 12:19:25+00:00,Bitcoin ETF Volume Soars To $10 Billion While Bitcoin Stumbles After Breaking ATH,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-etf-volume-soars/,"The US Bitcoin ETFs witnessed a busy Tuesday after the total volume recorded a new high of $10 billion and therefore surpassing the previous high of $7.7 billion on March 5. However, Bitcoin saw a deadly downturn right after the price hit and broke the November 2021 high of $69k and recorded a new all-time high at $69,324 on Tuesday.  The projection of Bitcoin’s price was highly fueled by the spot Bitcoin ETF volumes. The BlackRock ETF recorded the highest volume hitting a record $3.7 billion, followed closely by Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which recorded $2.8 billion, and FBTC (Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund). According to Bloomberg Spot Bitcoin ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on his X account, “These are banana numbers for ETFs under 2 months old.”  MILESTONE: the ten Bitcoin ETFs did $10b in volume today, smashing prev record set last Wed.. Volatility and volume go hand in hand with ETFs so not totally surprised. That said these are bananas numbers for ETfs under 2mo old. $IBIT, $FBTC, $BITB, $ARKB all w record days. pic.twitter.com/rIdbhoYifV In recent weeks, the demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs has been high, accelerating the Bitcoin bullish market to a new all-time high. The Spot Bitcoin ETF has played a major role in the history of Bitcoin; however, nobody currently knows what is next in the market since historical charts mostly guide traders. On Tuesday, Bitcoin soared past the previous high before it was strongly rejected by bears to decline its price by 10%. The price of the asset declined from $69,300 to $59,000. However, the market is currently making a comeback after trading half of its loss overnight. The price is back on track after gaining almost 3% of its loss. At the time of writing, the asset was trading at $65,900 with a trading volume of -1.31% in the last 24 hours. The sharp price decline is a clear indication that the price of the asset is volatile. However, the current market is still bullish, and speculation of breaking the $70k zone is still valid."
2024-03-05 16:30:15+00:00,"Just Now: Bitcoin Finally Tops At $69K And Slides At $65K, Is It Time To Sell?",https://blockzeit.com/just-now-bitcoin-finally-tops-at-69k-and-slides-at-64k-is-it-time-to-sell/,"After falling short of just a few dollars from breaching the coveted $69K barrier earlier, Bitcoin finally crossed the line to log a new historical peak. However, prices suddenly dropped to the $65K range as an influx of sellers took over the market within an hour. As of this writing at 4:00 PM UTC, Bitcoin is now trading with over 2% loss in its price over the 24-hour chart. The recent price action indicates a new low for the day, which could signal a temporary correction for the market. The latest movement of Bitcoin is definitely another “sell the news” affair as a lot of investors and traders are now likely scooping up their profits from an anticipated event. However, as the fourth halving of BTC is still 44 days away, this will most probably be on a short-term basis. The real score within BTC anyway not in its short-term price swings, but rather in its capacity to accumulate value over time. As the Bitcoin mining rewards are about to get cut from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC by mid-April, a tighter supply for the digital asset will really be felt by the market. The premier crypto asset’s scarcity will be further amplified by the non-stop hoarding of financial institutions. Last Tuesday’s trading day alone, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) once again exhibited a large amount of inflows totaling $562 million. It marked the third-largest inflows for these financial instruments in the US since they were greenlit by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 11. With BTC’s daily production pegged at an average of 900 daily, analysts believe that the massive demand created by spot Bitcoin ETFs could eventually overwhelm its circulating supply. And the coming halving will only catalyze an all-new level of shortage for it. Adding fuel to the fire is the bleak outlook on major global economies like the US and China. The US, in particular, is in a critical spot right now because it is estimated to be growing its debt by $1 trillion every 100 days."
2024-03-05 12:26:41+00:00,MicroStrategy To Offer $600 Million In Convertible Notes As Bitcoin Price Surges,https://blockzeit.com/microstrategy-to-offer-600m-convertible-notes/,"MicroStrategy plans to offer $600 million in convertible senior notes to acquire more Bitcoin. The company’s Bitcoin portfolio has surged, reaching a value of $13 billion in holdings. Bitcoin nearly reached its all-time high, soaring to over $68,000 in early Monday Eastern Time. The bullish sentiment of the year has heightened investor and trader interest in Bitcoin assets. As the largest Bitcoin holder in the cryptocurrency market, MicroStrategy announced its intention to issue $600 million in convertible senior notes. According to Michael Saylor’s tweet, the proceeds from this offering are earmarked for additional Bitcoin purchases. “$MSTR intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the note to acquire additional Bitcoin for general corporate purposes.” MicroStrategy Announces Proposed Private Offering of $600 Million of Convertible Senior Notes $MSTR https://t.co/PEN5dxesIb But what is a senior note? A senior note is a type of bond that takes precedence over other debts if the company goes bankrupt and is forced into liquidation. This note is set to mature in 2030, unless redeemed or converted before then. As Bitcoin’s price surged, MicroStrategy’s stock ($MSTR) also increased by 23% on Monday. The firm’s current Bitcoin holdings are valued at $13 billion. Excitement mounted on Monday as Bitcoin crossed the significant $65,000 resistance level. The asset managed to climb higher, recording a 2024 all-time high of $68,300, nearly surpassing its all-time high of $69,000. Factors like the Greed and Fear Index and spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, along with the upcoming halving event, played a significant role in this surge. If the bullish trend continues, the next target is foreseen at the $70,000 mark. Currently, Bitcoin has seen over a 5% increase in the past 24 hours, trading between the $67,500 resistance level and the $66,000 support level. Given the market speculation and volatility, it is anticipated that Bitcoin’s price might exceed its all-time high before the next halving event, which is 26 days away. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $67,870, showing a 5.43% increase over the last 24 hours and a total market capitalization of $1.31 trillion.”"
2024-03-04 16:27:09+00:00,"Bitcoin Surges To $66K, Now The 9th Top Asset In The World",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-surges-to-66k-now-the-9th-top-asset-in-the-world/,"Bitcoin continues to defy the odds as it surged to $66K today to break its all-time high record in euros at €60K despite a technical indicator already displaying an overbought condition for the crypto asset. The last time we saw it conquer that level was just days after its all-time high of $68,789 on November 10, 2021. With that, it’s only less than 4% away from achieving such a feat once more. The milestone comes right after the European Central Bank (ECB) gave its zero net fair value assessment for BTC, and it dismissed its ongoing bull run as nothing but a “dead cat bounce.” Its reasoning came with the usual tune of Bitcoin being used in illegal transactions, its significant energy consumption, and its tendency to be manipulated. The first and last arguments are actually things plaguing even Fiat currencies since time immemorial while the second has already been negated by the fact that Bitcoin miners have been shifting to renewable and more sustainable energy sources as of late to mitigate their energy expenses. The developments now position Bitcoin in the ninth place of the world’s top assets by market cap. The soaring price just pumped the total market value of its 19.64 million coins in circulation to a whopping $1.306 trillion. Early on, BTC just exceeded the $874.87 billion market cap of Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway in the rankings. Today, the digital asset dislodges Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Platforms in the list as it beats it by around $26 billion. The next step in Bitcoin’s rally could establish it above silver if it manages to get at least a $34 billion boost in its market cap. Looking at its trajectory, it may no longer be far behind from such a scenario. Bitcoin still has approximately 45 days before its block height reaches 840,000, which will trigger the halving. This is one of the key variables driving its towering prices. The other is the growing institutional demand for the world’s leading crypto, courtesy of the strong performance of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. If BTC sustains its trajectory, then the $100K price predictions by a lot of analysts could no longer be far from reality for this year."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."

Further fueling discussions about the digital asset’s potential and the broader implications for the crypto market. The recent surge was because of several factors, including increased institutional adoption and favorable regulatory developments.  The halving event, which, tentatively, is coming up on April 19, 2024, is anticipated to reduce supply and inflation, potentially pumping BTC prices even higher. Analysts are projecting a bullish outlook for Bitcoin in the coming months. The sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, with a ‘Fear & Greed Index’ teetering extreme greed. This optimism is mirrored by technical indicators, suggesting a continued upward trend. Binance’s aggregated user predictions also reflect confidence in Bitcoin’s growth, with a consensus pointing towards a gradual increase in value. The platform’s technical analysis aligns with this sentiment, highlighting a strong bullish trend in multiple time frames. The price of Bitcoin is currently at $65,188 as of March 4, 2024, 9:31 a.m. EST. This represents a 5.5% increase in the past 24 hours and a 27.1% increase in the past 7 days. BTC is still trending above the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA). Bitcoin price just broke out of the bullish pennant it had formed in the 1-hour timeframe, potentially aiming for $70,000. Overhead resistance levels for BTC currently lie at $67,441 and $72,441. If bears however decide to strike, BTC may fall back to $63,000 and $54,000 Investors considering Bitcoin should approach with caution and do their due diligence. For the most part, a black swan event is still expected to hit the markets. It will serve as the last attempt by the market makers to scoop liquidity before the Bitcoin halving event. The current sentiment around Bitcoin is buoyant, with predictions leaning towards a bullish future. Yet, the path ahead is riddled with uncertainties, and only time will reveal the true course of this digital currency’s journey."
2024-03-04 09:48:35+00:00,Bitcoin Price Crosses $65K As The FOMO Fiesta Takes Over,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-crosses-65k-as-the-fomo-fiesta-takes-over/,"BTC just peaked at $65,500 today as anticipation for its halving and strong demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to dictate its flow. As of this writing at around 9:00 AM UTC, the digital asset is trading at the $65,100 line with gains above 5% on the 24-hour chart. The developments now boost Bitcoin’s market cap to $1.277 trillion, which greatly contributes to the approximately $2.5 trillion overall market cap of the cryptocurrency market. The same timeframe also sees its trading volume pop by around 82% as $40.38 billion worth of BTC moved between wallets and exchanges. The massive buying pressure triggered so much volatility within the BTC ecosystem as prices went between $61,649 and $65,494 in just a day. The numbers now nudge Bitcoin prices closer to its all-time high (ATH) of $68,789 by 5%. This creates a renewed optimism that the digital currency may be on its way to a new ATH ahead of the halving. Investors, especially those who are new to crypto trading, are urged by experts to exercise restraint as FOMO is beginning to take over the market. Based on the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index by Alternative.me, the dial on the scale is now set at 82, which indicates “Extreme Greed” as the sentiment of the consensus. It should be noted that the ratings do not even reflect the real-time emotion of the market, so this could be higher by the next update if Bitcoin manages to hold the line at $65K today. Furthermore, readers are reminded that the present score is now near the 84 “Extreme Greed” exhibited by the market the day before Bitcoin went on an ATH on November 10, 2021. Benefiting a lot from the market frenzy are the spot Bitcoin ETF providers, particularly BlackRock and Fidelity. As of last week’s market close in the US, the two Wall Street powerhouses cornered 79% of the inflows in the sector. The ensuing craze now leaves BlackRock with $10 billion in assets under management in around seven weeks following its spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January. Its feat significantly dwarfed the performance of gold-backed ETFs, which took two years to reach such heights."
2024-03-04 04:05:24+00:00,"Cryptocurrency Market Cap Grows More Than $2.5T, Thanks To Bitcoin Surge",https://blockzeit.com/cryptocurrency-market-cap-grows-more-than-2-5t-thanks-to-bitcoin-surge/,"Bitcoin is pulling other cryptos in its wake as it rallies to recover its all-time high (ATH) near the $69K line. This has resulted in soaring prices for altcoins that put their combined market cap at $2.5 trillion. The recovery of the crypto market to its 2021 peak is mainly attributed to the upward trajectory of Bitcoin prices since the “sell the news” event after the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US waned and trading for the BTC halving started last month. The fourth halving in the BTC ecosystem is expected somewhere between April 18 to 20 once the network’s block height crosses the 840,000 mark. This will reduce Bitcoin mining rewards from the present 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC, which will trigger a tighter supply for the coin amid its growing institutional demand. Although another “sell the news” scenario will likely occur by then, bullish forecasts brought about by bleak economic outlook on major markets like in the US and China coupled with the aggressive BTC accumulation of financial institutions may establish a strong support for crypto prices. These could help negate the massive selling pressure or at least cushion them from completely tanking similar to the trend witnessed on the road to the long crypto winter along the end of 2021 up to the start of 2023. As of this writing at around 3:30 AM UTC, Bitcoin is starting the weekday with more than a 2% gain on the 24-hour chart to get back to the $63,500 range. The numbers now elevate its market cap to $1.24 trillion as it is only approximately 7% away from its ATH of $68,789 displayed on November 10, 2021. The same timeframe also recorded around 54% increase in Bitcoin’s trading volume as $33.96 billion worth of BTC moved between wallets and exchanges out of its 19.64 million circulating supply. The rising prices of Bitcoin have solidified its position among the top 10 tradable assets in the world by market cap. BTC currently ranks 10th in the list after it dislodged Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway last month. The digital asset is presently roughly $40 billion away from Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Platforms."
2024-03-03 05:50:10+00:00,Bitcoin Price To Surpass Its ATH As US Racks Up $1T In Debt Every 100 Days,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-to-surpass-its-ath-as-us-racks-up-1t-in-debt-every-100-days/,"Recently, analysts from the Bank of America revealed yet another alarming assessment of the US economy’s direction. They found that the nation’s debt has been racking up an additional $1 trillion per 100 days, and the trend will likely continue. “The US national debt is rising by $1 trillion every 100 days,” said the gloomy forecast of BofA Chief Strategist in an email to CNBC. “little wonder ‘debt debasement’ trades closing in on all-time highs, i.e. gold $2,077/oz, Bitcoin $67,734.” The distressing evaluation of BofA adds fuel to the negative appraisal of other financial institutions. Back in November, Moody’s Investors Service dropped the ratings of the US government from stable to negative because of its inefficient fiscal policy. “In the context of higher interest rates, without effective fiscal policy measures to reduce government spending or increase revenues,” commented Moody’s in a CNBC report. “Moody’s expects that the US’ fiscal deficits will remain very large, significantly weakening debt affordability.” As of January 4 this year, the data published by the US Department of Treasury shows that US debt has reached a point of no return at $34 trillion. That could be the case until an effective fiscal strategy is implemented. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon criticized the trajectory of the US government because of the growing expenditures of the White House and Congress that have resulted in mounting debts. “It is a cliff, we see the cliff,” Dimon summed it all up. “It’s about 10 years out, we’re going 60 miles an hour.” With all these in mind, the prospect of Bitcoin surpassing its all-time high may not be far behind. Right now, it’s only less than 10% away from its ATH of $68,789 achieved on November 10, 2021, at its current rate of $62K. While there’s a predictable “sell the news” event looming moments before or after its halving, these developments coupled with the strong institutional demand for BTC due to the strong performances of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could at least help cushion the prices. On the other hand, depending on the consensus at that point, these could also delay the inevitable sell-off and push Bitcoin prices further."
2024-03-02 07:33:38+00:00,"Forget $100K, Bitcoin Price Is Heading To $200K",https://blockzeit.com/forget-100k-bitcoin-price-is-heading-to-200k/,"Bitcoin just went on a three-year top as it rallied around $63,000 this week, so many are now on the edge of their seats in anticipation of the digital asset potentially breaking its ATH near $70,000 before the fourth halving in April this year. According to analysts, this promising news is just the start of Bitcoin’s bull run. Despite the looming “sell the news” event occurring moments away or immediately after the halving, analysts in The Motley Fool earlier predicted that the ensuing months could position it to another rally. They believe it’s heading to the $100K territory by this time. Right now, the consensus thinks that the $100K surge of Bitcoin is plausible before 2024 ends or by early 2025. However, veteran trader Peter Brandt’s solid take on the charts last Tuesday revealed that it could breach a price target between $120,000 and $200,000 with the caveat that a close below the previous week’s close could nullify his forecast. Bitcoin UpdateWith the thrust above the upper boundary of the 15-month channel, the target for the current bull market cycle scheduled to end in Aug/Sep 2025 is being raised from $120,000 to $200,000. $BTC A close below last week's low will nullify this interpretation pic.twitter.com/19ZXpAQW0v After that, BTC seemed to have displayed a steady climb this week to nearly $64,000 and has long sailed past the $50K area. It should be added that the crypto asset showed a remarkable performance in the past month as it went from $42K to a peak of $64K before settling at around $62K this Saturday morning to close the gap between the prevailing rate and its ATH by less than 10%. Bitcoin also exhibited utmost resilience amid the FUD created by the sudden crash of Coinbase this week, which the crypto exchange blamed on a “large surge of traffic” in its network. This only shows that the digital coin has already found a firm footing on the $59K and $60K lines. As of this writing at 7:00 AM UTC, Bitcoin price is resting at around $62,000 with a 20% gain compared to last week’s valuation. Thanks to the bull rush within the past few days, BTC just grew its market cap to $1.22 trillion as it solidified its position within the top 10 assets in the world by market cap. The rankings now place Bitcoin in the number 10 spot between Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway (with a $882.27 billion market cap) and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta (formerly Facebook with a $1.28 trillion market cap)."
2024-03-01 12:18:42+00:00,Bitcoin Slides After Hitting $65k-$68k Resistance Zone,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-slides-after-hitting-65k-68k-resistance-zone/,"The Bitcoin price made a significant bull run and recorded a 2024 all-time high after the price reached $64,000. But merely had it reached the $64k level, the price declined significantly below the $60k level. According to analysts, the price of the asset is at the $65-$68k resistance level; this is attributed to the price decline.  I read many 200K forecasts. Just to note here that we are now close to resistance area between 65K-68K.3 years ago I drew attention to that resistance. I again draw your attention to the horizontal resistance. https://t.co/aHNH1pDQoN pic.twitter.com/9VzwViYzMh Moreover, JP Morgan mentioned that the post-halving impact asset price decline; according to the institution, the halving will negatively impact miners due to low rewards and high production costs. Halving, which is an important event in the landscape of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large, is customary to occur in April. Historically, halving is followed by a price correlation before a bull run is witnessed. JP Morgan predicts that miners and cryptocurrency dynamics will face challenging times.  Currently, the average production cost per bitcoin stands at $26,500. Post-halving, this figure is poised to leap to $53,000, reflecting the reduced token issuance and the consequent scarcity. However, JPMorgan’s strategists introduce a note of caution, suggesting that a spike in mining difficulty could temper production costs by 20%, potentially dragging the post-halving price to a lower orbit of $42,000. The bulls were able to spike the asset price above $63k and $64k before bears flexed their muscles on Thursday and dipped the price below the $60k level to reach the $58,700 mark. The asset, however, increased its price and managed to increase the price by 5% since the dip. The next resistance is seen at the $62,000 level; if bulls manage to escalate the price above the zone, the next resistance zone could be at the $64,000 level. On the flip of the coin, if bears take the charge, the price will be supported at the $58,000 level, and the next support will be at the $53,500 level.  At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at the $61,500 mark, recording a decline in price of -2.36%; however, the asset has increased its price by 4.68% since its decline. At the moment, Bitcoin is 13% close to breaking its all-time high."
2024-03-01 05:54:07+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Hits $64,000, Becomes The 14th Largest Currency Globally Ahead Of Russian Ruble",https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-price-hits-64000-becomes-the-14th-largest-currency-globally-ahead-of-russian-ruble/,"Bitcoin price soared immensely this week, adding over $12,000 to its value in the space of just a week. The market cap also rose greatly, with over $200 billion added to BTC’s valuation.  The surge in the market cap pushed the asset to become the 14th largest currency in the world, overtaking the Russian ruble. The increase in Bitcoin market cap dominance from 48.9% to 50.3% indicates Bitcoin gained against the altcoins and the flow of liquidity was generally from altcoins to BTC. Small and microcaps suffered losses this week, as mid and large-cap altcoins saw double-digit percentage gains. Last week Bitcoin was trending in a consolidation zone that it had entered the week before that. It was either the bulls win the fight and push the price of the asset to $55,000 and beyond or the bears win and push BTC’s price to $48,900 and below. The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) was holding the price of Bitcoin up, and come Monday, February 26, 2024, Bitcoin witnessed a surge in buy volume that pushed the price above the $53,000 barrier. What followed next was extreme buy pressure and FOMO from crypto investors that caused BTC price to soar to new yearly highs of $64,000 before correcting back to $61,000.  At its current price, Bitcoin is just 12% shy of its all-time high price. Bitcoin’s surge this week was the stuff of legend and signaled the beginning of the first phase of the bull market – the pre-halving pump.It is expected that altcoins will now begin running anytime from next week as profits from Bitcoin and large caps begin flowing into small, medium, and microcap altcoins. Bitcoin is still well above the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day simple moving averages, providing bulls with ample time to rest and recuperate for the next run-up. The $64,000 level provided local resistance and the major fight for Bitcoin bulls will be to break above this price. If the bull should succeed in its quest, BTC may touch and surpass its previous all-time high price of $69,000. We expect $69,000 to provide a strong resistance when price action reaches that point. However, if we break it, BTC could easily rise and hit $77,000. In the case that bears prevail at the current barrier, BTC will find support at $58,000 and $52,000.

2024-02-29 13:47:33+00:00,Bitcoin: A Detailed Analysis Of The Current Situation And A Guide To Future-Oriented Investment Strategies,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-a-detailed-analysis-of-the-current-situation-and-a-guide-to-future-oriented-investment-strategies/,"In the world of crypto-assets, Bitcoin plays a central role, not only as a pioneer among digital money systems, but also as a barometer for the market as a whole. The ability to predict market movements and act accordingly is invaluable for investors. One method that is becoming increasingly important in this context is the Ichimoku indicator, a complex but powerful tool for technical analysis. The recent development where the Tenkan-Sen line crossed the Kijun-Sen line has generated considerable interest and points to potential changes in the Bitcoin market. This phenomenon, coupled with an in-depth analysis of historical patterns and current market conditions, provides valuable insight for forward-looking investment strategies. The following analysis highlights the fundamentals of the Ichimoku indicator, the relevance of recent market developments and the resulting strategic considerations for investors to successfully navigate the dynamic world of Bitcoin and other crypto assets. In 2024, Bitcoin experienced an extraordinary price surge, pushing the crypto asset above the $60,000 mark for the first time since 2021. This rise not only represented a 12% increase in just 12 hours, but also a $6,500 increase in the value of Bitcoin per unit. Such growth reflects the volatile and dynamic nature of the bull market phases in which Bitcoin has reached new highs in the past. In parallel with the rise in the price of Bitcoin, open interest – an indicator that measures the total number of open contracts in the futures and options markets and is a measure of the flow of capital into the market – saw a significant increase to well over 24 billion dollars. This figure surpassed the previous highs recorded at the time of Bitcoin’s last all-time high of around USD 64,000. The rise in open interest indicates increasing participation and interest in the Bitcoin market, particularly in anticipation of further price gains. Spot ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) were a major factor in the price rise and increased open interest, reaching a new volume record. Spot ETFs allow investors to invest in Bitcoin without holding the crypto asset directly, promoting easier accessibility and wider adoption among traditional investors. The success of spot ETFs, particularly the achievement of a new all-time high in trading volume since their launch, underlines the growing demand and confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class. Bitcoin’s price rise and increased open interest were accompanied by remarkable momentum in investor behavior. Positions worth over 1.2 million dollars recorded significant gains, driven by the positive performance of spot ETFs. This momentum reflects an increasing participation of both retail and institutional investors in the Bitcoin market and signals an increased adoption of crypto assets in general. Bitcoin’s recent price rise above $60,000 clearly marks a significant milestone in the crypto asset’s development. The combination of a significant increase in open interest and the success of spot ETFs underscores the growing appeal of Bitcoin as an asset class. These developments point to continued momentum and increased interest in the crypto-asset market, potentially setting Bitcoin on a path to new highs. The transformative impact of spot ETFs on the Bitcoin market in 2024 represents a turning point in the acceptance and integration of Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. The introduction of these financial instruments has not only set a new volume record, highlighting the growing interest in Bitcoin as an asset class, but has also stimulated the market through significant increases in open interest and profits. Spot ETFs contributed significantly to price stability and enabled a broader range of investors to invest in Bitcoin, resulting in massive net inflows of USD 515 million and confirming the strong demand for Bitcoin. Compared to traditional markets, Bitcoin ETFs have shown exceptional performance, with ten times more net inflows than all gold ETFs combined, emphasizing the attractiveness of Bitcoin as an investment vehicle. The outlook for Bitcoin is optimistic given the positive reception of spot ETFs and the current market momentum. The Bitcoin price surpassing $60,000 for the first time since 2021 and approaching an all-time high, as well as the increase in open interest to over $24 billion, are indicators of Bitcoin’s potential growth. Despite these positive developments, historical experience urges caution, as Bitcoin’s volatility and potential regulatory developments could have unforeseen effects. It is crucial for investors to pursue a balanced strategy that incorporates both optimism and caution. The ability to interpret market signals and react to market changes is essential for success in the cryptocurrency market. Recent developments provide a solid foundation for investment decisions, but require continuous monitoring of the market and adapting investment strategies to changing conditions. The future of Bitcoin remains exciting, and an informed, strategic approach will be crucial for investors to capitalize on the opportunities ahead while minimizing risk. In the following chapters, we will delve deeper into the basics of the Ichimoku indicator and its relevance to Bitcoin. The Ichimoku indicator, a comprehensive technical analysis method developed by Goichi Hosoda in Japan in the 1930s, provides an in-depth understanding of market trends and dynamics. It consists of five main components that work together to generate buy and sell signals, assess market momentum and identify support and resistance levels. These components include the Kijun-Sen (baseline), Tenkan-Sen (conversion line), Senkou Span A and B (leading spans) and the Chikou Span (lagging line). Within the Ichimoku indicator, the crossing of the Tenkan-Sen over the Kijun-Sen is a significant event. This specific constellation, often referred to as a “TC crossover”, signals a potential change in market sentiment or a new trend start. The analysis highlights that such a crossover has taken place on the two-hour chart of Bitcoin, which is a strong signal for a positive market development. This crossover is particularly relevant as it has historically occurred at significant turning points in Bitcoin’s market cycle. By studying past Bitcoin cycles, it has been found that the TC crossover often occurs on the cusp of phase 3 of the bull market – the parabolic rise. For example, such a crossover was observed shortly before entering the parabolic phase in 2019 and during the final phase of the 2015 accumulation cycle. These crossovers correlated with the breakout from consolidated market phases and the start of significant price increases. In the current market phase, the TC crossover on the two-hour chart of Bitcoin again signals a possible start of phase 3 of the bull market. This observation is supported by analyzing the positioning of the Ichimoku components, especially the interaction of the Tenkan-Sen and Kijun-Sen lines. The indicator shows not only the direction of the trend, but also the strength of the market and potential resistance or support levels. Understanding and interpreting the Ichimoku indicator is crucial for investors and traders. The current TC crossover provides a strategic signal that can be used to assess market sentiment and identify entry or exit points. However, it is important that investors conduct a comprehensive analysis and consider other indicators and market factors to ensure informed decision making. In summary, the TK cross in the Ichimoku indicator provides a powerful tool for analyzing Bitcoin and other crypto assets. The recent crossover points to a positive development in the Bitcoin market and could be the harbinger for the start of a new parabolic upward phase. Investors should keep an eye on these and other signals in order to adjust their strategies accordingly. The recent crossing of the Tenkan-Sen over the Kijun-Sen in the Ichimoku indicator on the two-hour chart of Bitcoin has attracted significant attention. This development is considered a significant event, potentially signaling the beginning of the third phase of a bull market. However, to understand the full implications of this development, it is important to look at both the immediate impact and the long-term implications of this crossover. The immediate impact of this TC cross has been underpinned by a detailed analysis of historical data. In previous Bitcoin cycles, such a cross often correlated with a pivotal moment that marked the transition into a parabolic growth phase. Historically, the crossing of the Tenkan Sen over the Kijun Sen was followed by a phase of significant price increases. This pattern was evident in the 2019 and 2015 cycles, where the TK crossover occurred shortly before the entry into the parabolic phase of the bull market. The long-term implications of the TC crossover are particularly relevant for investors looking to understand Bitcoin’s market cycle. Not only does the cross indicate a possible start of phase 3, but it also provides a perspective on market health and trend progression. The analysis shows that in the past, the TC cross was not only followed by the immediate upward movement, but also that the market was in a robust and healthy phase. This is reinforced by the expectation of further confirmation, namely the crossing of the line (Senkou Span A) above the line (Kijun-Sen), which is another strong signal for the bull market phase. Although the TC crossing is a strong indication of a positive market trend, analysts and investors are waiting for additional confirmation signals to get a full confirmation of phase 3. These include the crossing of lines in the Ichimoku indicator as well as certain key indicators on Bitcoin’s monthly chart, such as the closing of a monthly candlestick above a specific Fibonacci level and an RSI reading above 73. These confirmation signals are crucial to predict a long-term bullish trend with greater certainty. In light of these developments, it is important for investors to take a strategic perspective. Historical analysis and current market dynamics offer valuable insights, but a comprehensive look at other market indicators and factors is essential. Investors should remain emotionally disciplined and pursue a balanced strategy that considers both potential short-term gains and long-term vision. The ability to interpret market signals such as the TK cross in the Ichimoku indicator and act accordingly is increasingly becoming an important factor for success in the crypto asset market. In summary, the current TC cross in the Ichimoku indicator signals a potentially significant development in the Bitcoin market that has both short-term and long-term implications for investors. While the immediate implications point to a positive market trend, confirmation from further signals is required to predict a sustained bullish phase with greater certainty. Investors should monitor these developments closely and adjust their investment strategies accordingly to take advantage of the potential opportunities that could arise from this market phase. It is crucial to maintain a balanced approach and not get carried away by short-term market fluctuations. Instead, strategic decisions should be based on a thorough analysis of the overall market, including technical indicators such as the Ichimoku indicator, and a deep understanding of the underlying market dynamics. Ultimately, the ability to make informed and disciplined decisions will make the difference between success and failure in the volatile world of crypto assets. The recent breakout where the Tenkan-Sen line crossed the Kijun-Sen line in the Ichimoku indicator for Bitcoin signals a potentially transformative phase for the Bitcoin market. This event, combined with the expectation of further confirmation signals, provides a solid foundation for developing strategic approaches for investors. The outlook for Bitcoin appears positive based on technical analysis and historical data, but it is critical that investors adopt a prudent and informed strategy. Confirmation of the bull market phase depends on several key indicators, including the Senkou Span A crossing above the Kijun-Sen and specific conditions on the monthly chart, such as a monthly candlestick closing above a critical Fibonacci level and a Relative Strength Index (RSI) above 73. These indicators serve as additional confirmation of the strength and sustainability of the bull market. Based on the Ichimoku analysis and the aforementioned confirmation signals, an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin can be predicted. The current crossover signals the beginning of a possible phase 3 of the bull market, which is characterized by parabolic price increases. However, it is important to continuously monitor the market health and wait for confirmation from the additional signals mentioned above to get a full assessment of the market situation. Given the current market environment and the prospect of a continued bull market, here are strategic considerations for investors: Stay disciplined and don’t be swayed by short-term price volatility. Focus on long-term goals and strategies. Even if the signals for Bitcoin are positive, investors should pursue a diversified portfolio strategy to minimize risk and optimize overall returns. Given the inherent volatility of crypto assets, using stop-loss orders is a smart strategy to limit potential losses. Investors should keep an eye on the development of further confirmation signals and adjust their strategies accordingly to make the most of the expected bull market phase. The crypto asset market is constantly evolving. Investors should continuously educate themselves and stay informed about market developments, technical analysis and fundamental changes. Ichimoku analysis provides a deep insight into the market mechanisms of Bitcoin and signals a potentially positive development for the near future. Investors who follow a sound and disciplined strategy are well positioned to benefit from the upcoming market movements. However, it is crucial to carefully weigh both the potential opportunities and risks and make decisions based on a broad range of market information and personal investment objectives. The six chapters have covered in detail the fundamentals and significance of the Ichimoku indicator, current developments in the Bitcoin market and strategic approaches for investors. Through the analysis, it became clear that the recent crossover of the Tenkan-Sen over the Kijun-Sen in the Ichimoku indicator is a potential signal for the start of a new phase in the Bitcoin bull market. This development, supported by historical patterns and the observation of further confirmation signals, offers an optimistic outlook for the Bitcoin market. The Ichimoku indicator has proven to be a valuable tool for gaining insights into market structure and potential trend reversals. The crossing of the Tenkan-Sen and Kijun-Sen provides an early signal of market movements. The recent TC crossover in the context of historical data indicates the possible start of a parabolic growth phase for Bitcoin. Investors should consider these signals in the context of other market indicators. In a potentially volatile market environment, it is crucial for investors to follow a disciplined and informed investment strategy. Diversification, the use of stop-loss orders and continuous monitoring of the market are key elements for success. The future performance of the Bitcoin market depends on a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments and the continued acceptance of crypto assets in the financial system. While Ichimoku analysis and historical patterns suggest a positive trend for Bitcoin, it is important that investors remain vigilant and adapt their strategies to changing market conditions. Overall, the Ichimoku indicator together with a comprehensive market analysis provides a solid basis for investment decisions. By combining this technical analysis with a disciplined investment strategy, investors can be better positioned to take advantage of upcoming market movements while minimizing their risk. The future of Bitcoin remains exciting, and investors who are well informed and strategic will be best positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that present themselves.

2024-02-29 09:53:06+00:00,Coinbase Is Back To Business And Provides Explanation For The Crash,https://blockzeit.com/coinbase-is-back-to-business-and-provides-explanation-for-the-crash/,"Coinbase was swamped with complaints due to users seeing zero balances in their accounts and having problems trading at around Wednesday morning Pacific Standard Time. The support team of the cryptocurrency exchange immediately acknowledged the issue and assured users that their accounts and funds were safe. Likewise, the company guaranteed that they launched an investigation of the matter. An hour before the crash, the Coinbase Status page already began posting an update about Ethereum (ETH) users having trouble with their transactions. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also went to X in order to help quell the worries of customers. During that time, he stated that the “large surge of traffic” flooded their network, which caused the crash. By evening, Coinbase informed users that their systems were up but a few customers may still see inaccurate balances in their accounts. Later on, the crypto exchange claimed it was business as usual and the display issues have been resolved. Following the restoration of Coinbase’s services, Armstrong admitted that the traffic exceeded the capacity of their network in a way they didn’t expect. “We had modeled a ~10x surge in traffic and load tested it,” the CEO explained. “This exceeded that number.” The next line, however, drew some criticisms online. He added, “It’s expensive to keep services over-provisioned, but we’ll need to keep working on auto-scaling solutions, and killing any remaining bottlenecks.” Apps are now recovering.We had modeled a ~10x surge in traffic and load tested it. This exceeded that number.It's expensive to keep services over-provisioned, but we'll need to keep working on auto-scaling solutions, and killing any remaining bottlenecks. Thank you for… https://t.co/JXVppV57AF One commenter chided Armstrong for his lack of foresight as a crypto custody provider and for skimping on over-provisioning to prepare them for such a scenario. Another pointed out that Coinbase is already charging high fees for users, so it should be out of the question. Brian you are now a financial institution – pay the money and be over-provisioned. You have a responsibility to those whose money you custody. Why is this even a question? Furthermore, several users chastised the company for ruining what could have been a good trading day for them. Of course, some came up with the customary conspiracy theory that Coinbase may have intentionally tried to sabotage the market to reap some profits out of the ensuing chaos. Or you were running out of bitcoin, decided to sell everyones portfolios on the market nuking the price, and then buying it all back again so you have more bitcoin to sell? 😂 The Coinbase crash coincided with the day Bitcoin took off on a three-year high near $64K and Ether was also trading at its two-year top around $3,500, which added to the chagrin of the users and FUD in the market."
2024-02-29 06:57:11+00:00,Bitcoin Is Less Than 10% From ATH: Still Early To Hop In?,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-is-less-than-10-from-ath-still-early-to-hop-in/,"It was a great day for Bitcoin and its investors yesterday as the king of cryptocurrencies gleefully climbed to the $63,734 mark – a price it last touched around November 2021. While the crypto community is rife with excitement about the development, there’s also great FOMO from potential investors, especially those who were sluggish to invest in the early stages of the upward trend or who pulled out too early.  The vast majority of those yet to ride the Bitcoin wave are asking if $62K is a good entry point, fearing the price may retract from here. However, compared to the last bull run, there seems to be a bright green light for those looking to invest now. There are several indicators that this might just be the early stage of BTC’s upward trajectory. After 2017, “Bitcoin” had its highest Google search volume around August of 2021 during the warm-up stages for its ATH. The highest search volume for “Bitcoin” in 2021 was around 66 (out of 100). Meanwhile, Bitcoin is still wriggling around a search volume of 23 as of February 2024. From the much lower search volume, we can infer that retail investment is yet to peak and there might still be a higher chance for Bitcoin to gain way beyond its current price. The significant lag in altcoin price actions when compared to Bitcoin could be another indicator that the bull run might just be in its starting stages. As per CoinMarketCap, BTC has a market cap of $1.22 trillion as of this writing, whereas altcoins altogether represent $1.06 trillion in market cap. As with the last bull cycle, we might need to see a significant price action correlation between altcoins and Bitcoin to say that the bull run is in full force. Celebrity campaigns for Bitcoin are yet to match the last bull run. It was in 2021 that groundbreaking events like El-Salvador making Bitcoin a legal tender happened. Although we see some public support for Bitcoin by industry leaders, top politicians, and a few celebrities partnering with exchanges, there’s yet to be widespread and public celebrity action on the cryptocurrency. Besides pro traders, analysts, and new market entrants talking about Bitcoin online, we can identify the climax of the bull season when average non-crypto-savvy people begin speculating and posting more on Bitcoin. Another metric to determine how far up we are in the bull season is how many people are downloading and using cryptocurrency apps via the Play Store and App Store. With crypto applications scarcely appearing in the top 20 in top charting apps, it seems the bull run is still getting started. For the past few days, bitcoin has maintained a healthy movement. Bitcoin rocketed to $63,734 by 5:15 pm UTC yesterday, a remarkable ascent and the asset’s highest price since 2021. As of this writing, Bitcoin has dropped by 2.38% to $62,218"
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2024-02-28 13:54:31+00:00,Breaking News: Bitcoin Conquers The $60K Territory Like A Boss,https://blockzeit.com/breaking-news-bitcoin-conquers-the-60k-territory-like-a-boss/,"As of 1:30 PM UTC, we just witnessed a breathtaking move for Bitcoin as it just proverbially crossed the Rubicon, which was the only obstacle holding it back toward its highest-ever valuation at $68,799 back on November 10, 2021. As of this writing, Bitcoin is now worth $60,500 with over 6% gain in the 24-hour chart. This is the first time since November 2021 for the digital asset to reach such heights, which is the same month and year it went on an ATH. The pump also raises its market cap to $1.18 trillion to solidify its position as among the top 10 tradable assets in the world by market capitalization. Surprisingly, the trading volume of the cryptocurrency is down by around 7% in the same period as $49.94 billion worth of BTC moved between wallet addresses. The same span saw prices swing between a $56,329 low and the current top above $60,500. The rally narrows the gap between Bitcoin’s prevailing valuation and ATH by less than 13%. The year 2024 started with high hopes for Bitcoin as it anticipated two major events taking place in its ecosystem. One was the much-awaited approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the other was the halving. The former already occurred on January 11, which has proven to be a lucrative venture for providers like BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and others. During Tuesday’s trading, spot Bitcoin ETFs generated a staggering trading volume of more than $3 billion. Notably, it’s the second consecutive day they have displayed such a feat. BlackRock led the charge with $1.32 billion cashflows followed by Grayscale at $799.16 million, Fidelity at $576.81 million, and Ark Invest at $203.76 million. The rest of the gang went from $78.16 million (for Bitwise) down to $1.36 million (for Hashdex). However, the key narrative that has greater weight than spot Bitcoin ETFs is the halving occurring sometime between April 18 and 20 as soon as BTC reaches its 840,000th block height. Historically, these cycles have resulted in new ATH for Bitcoin because of its deflationary nature. As a recap, each Bitcoin halving cycle reduces mining rewards by 50%. In the current epoch, miners on the network’s proof-of-work protocol are rewarded 6.25 BTC per block mined. This will be scaled down to 3.125 BTC by April, which will result in tighter competition among miners as well as scarcer supply amidst the growing institutional demand for the crypto asset. With these, analysts predict that it might catalyze a new ATH for Bitcoin, and the consensus points to a possible $100K peak or even more after the halving."
2024-02-28 13:24:01+00:00,Investors Go FOMO As Bitcoin Teases Crossing The $60K Territory,https://blockzeit.com/investors-go-fomo-as-bitcoin-teases-crossing-the-60k-territory/,"The crypto community is all pumped up as Bitcoin breached its resistance on the way to $59,000. This is an important milestone for the digital asset because the last time it reached such a point was in November 2021. It was the same month and year it scored an all-time high (ATH) of $68,789. The recent rally boosted BTC by over 5% in the 24-hour chart, more than 15.86% in the seven-day chart, above 39% in the monthly chart, and 153% in the one-year chart. The crypto asset’s valuation is now just less than 14% away from its historical high on November 10, 2024. The movement of Bitcoin currently coincides with expert forecasts made during the past couple of months saying that it could rally less than 60 days away from its next halving cycle. According to Watcher Guru’s Bitcoin Halving Countdown timer, we may only be 50 days away from this momentous occasion in the BTC ecosystem. However, do note that this is a mere estimate as no one knows for a fact about the time when Bitcoin’s block height will reach 840,000, which will trigger the halving. With that, the affair could be between April 18 and 20. The Bitcoin bandwagon primes up as its prices soar to new heights, thanks to several catalysts in the cryptocurrency market like MicroStrategy’s major Bitcoin portfolio increase to 193,000 BTC, strong multi-billion dollars of cash flows logged by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and optimism toward the halving. New data from Alternative’s Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows the highest greed score attained so far this year. Based on the index, the market sentiment now sits at 82, which points to Extreme Greed. The numbers are a significant jump from yesterday’s 79 points, last week’s 78 points, and last month’s 55 points. Nonetheless, the dial has been within Extreme Greed throughout the week. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a measurement of market sentiment on a scale of 0 to 100. Scores below 50 show fear on the part of investors as they become cautious of the market for one reason or another, which could present a buying opportunity. On the other hand, the opposite signals a possible correction in the market. The high greed score right now is influenced by the growing FOMO (fear of missing out) being felt by investors as they race to make their trades before Bitcoin’s upward momentum reaches a saturation point, lest risk missing out on a potentially profitable investment."
2024-02-28 11:13:13+00:00,Will Ethereum ETF Have The Same Effect On The Market As Bitcoin ETF?,https://blockzeit.com/will-ethereum-etf-have-the-same-effect-on-the-market-as-bitcoin-etf/,"This week started with a pleasant surge in the crypto market, reaching a new market cap of $2.2 trillion early Monday. Bitcoin experienced a notable 30% surge during Tuesday’s American trading session, surpassing the $53k resistance level and reaching a peak of $59,200 today. This bullish trend extended to the rest of the crypto market with Ethereum and Dogecoin making significant gains. A significant contributor to Bitcoin’s rise was the Spot Bitcoin ETF, witnessing a substantial increase in trading inflow, totaling $2.4 billion. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF also played a key role, accumulating a volume of $1.3 billion over the last two days. However, attention is turning to May 23rd, when the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) will make a crucial decision regarding Spot Ethereum ETF approval. Analysts anticipate a procedure similar to the Bitcoin ETF approval for Ethereum ETF in late May. Bitwise Crypto Research Analyst Ryan compared Ethereum’s current situation to Bitcoin’s before its January 11th approval, stating in a Finance Yahoo interview, “I’m not surprised that we’re seeing Ethereum catch a similar bid here heading into the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in May.” 🚨JUST IN: Grayscale CEO says: ""A spot #Ethereum ETF is a matter of when, not a matter of if.""#XRP ETF is also on the way. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/2qnX2UuxAi Considering Bitcoin’s history, approval of ETFs has historically increased demand and buying pressure. Ryan emphasized the potential market dynamics shift for Ethereum with the approval of the Spot Ethereum ETF, stating, “If there were ETFs to come to market, you have the demand coming from those sidelined investors.” The SEC’s response to VanEck’s Spot Ether application on May 23rd will be crucial. In addition, the Dencun network is set to upgrade the Ethereum and Ethereum L2 networks in March, just before the Ether ETF decision. This eagerly awaited upgrade aims to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs for users. At the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $3,245, reflecting a 2.23% increase in the last 24 hours."

As of this writing at 9:00 AM UTC, the digital asset is trading at around $59,000 with above 5% gain within that duration according to CoinMarketCap data. The amount by which the cryptocurrency was traded over that span went down by 11% though. Despite that, an estimated $43.6 billion worth of BTC moved between wallets and exchanges within the day as it found support at $56,219 and a peak at $59,000. The developments narrowed the gap between Bitcoin’s price today and its all-time high (ATH) on November 10, 2021, at $68,789 by nearly 15%. So far, it’s not showing any signs of slowing down as it rallies closer to the $60,000 barrier. As reported earlier, MicroStrategy made another 3,000 Bitcoin purchase on Monday for $155 million. This raises its hoard to 193,000 BTC bought for approximately $6.09 billion at an average of $31,544 a pop. Should the numbers beat the $60K boundary, Michael Saylor’s company would already be sitting on an $11.58 billion treasure trove. That translates to an unrealized profit of almost double the company’s total investment in Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s ascent was further fueled by the strong demand for spot BTC ETFs in the US. The last trading day yielded more than $3 billion in transaction volume for the second day in a row. Leading the charge was BlackRock with $1.32 billion cash flows followed by Grayscale at $799.16 million and Fidelity at $576.81 million. The rest got between $1.36 million (Hashdex) and $203.76 million (Ark Invest). JUST IN: Total spot #Bitcoin ETF trading volume surpasses $3 billion for the second day in a row:• BlackRock: $1,323,940,885• Grayscale: $799,160,227• Fidelity: $576,812,680• Ark Invest: $203,762,725• Bitwise: $78,165,380• Invesco: $41,289,809• Franklin:… The most anticipated event in the Bitcoin ecosystem this year is the halving occurring sometime between April 18 and 20. This will cut the rewards per mined block from the present 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC once the crypto asset’s block height reaches 840,000. The affair is expected to exert more pressure on the tightening supply of Bitcoin amid the rising retail and institutional demands. With that, analysts project the coin to surpass its existing ATH all the way to the $100K border post-halving."
2024-02-28 04:23:56+00:00,"Impending $100K God Candle For BTC, Hints Max Keiser",https://blockzeit.com/impending-100k-god-candle-for-btc-hints-max-keiser/,"The Chairman of Volcano Energy and advisor to El Salvador’s president, Max Keiser, has fueled the Bitcoin speculation with a tweet hinting that the current Bitcoin rally might be the warm-up for a God candle that will climax at $100K.  “God Candle incoming: Are we witnessing the start of a  $100,000 God Candle?” wrote Keiser on X. Keiser who dubs himself the “High Priest of Bitcoin” has been an ardent Bitcoin advocate and one of the key figures preaching and pushing for Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador and globally. He’s also an early Bitcoin adopter, who bought his first BTC in 2011 at only $1, which explains why he has a massive audience that counts on his predictions. However, he has had a history of overzealous and inflated Bitcoin predictions, partly driven by his belief in Bitcoin’s potential to transform finance and the sentiment he holds towards the crypto. Keiser had already gone past the $100K target as far back as 2020 when he told podcast host Alex Jones that he was raising his official target “for the first time in eight years” to $400K. Interestingly, while Keiser made his analysis based on prevailing US economic situations, BTC has yet to even cross the $70K mark in 2024. Meanwhile, Keiser is not the only one who has issued a $100K prediction for Bitcoin following the recent rally. Market researcher TheBitcoinLayer has also revealed that they view “the current bull run to be in its beginning stages.” According to their analysis chart, a shallow path of increase could amount to the “$100,000 price over the next few years” while a “more aggressive path” could see it happening towards the end of 2024. Just last week, billionaire investor and Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki also predicted: “Bitcoin to $100K by June 2024.” Although Kiyosaki’s prediction didn’t come with a background on the dynamics that could result in the $100K target, there’s a big probability the halving which will occur in less than 50 days will be a big contributor. The underlying principle of Bitcoin halving is the reduction in BTC supply which invariably increases the demand and the price of the cryptocurrency. If you think Kiyosaki’s $100K by June prediction is an overstatement, you may need to listen to Samson Mow CSO of Blockstream who targets Bitcoin at $1M before the halving. According to Mow, Bitcoin will rack up at least 10 Omega candles to reach $1 million within the next few weeks. “The Omega candle is a $100K green candle on the daily”, says Mow, and it usually “happens after the God candle which is $10K.” He predicts days of at least 10 Omega candles – which will send BTC to $1M before April’s halving. “My thesis is that we’re going to see it before the halving…” said Mow. Bitcoin struck an impressive $57,416 around 12:45 pm UTC – which represents its 3-year high since 2021. Within the past few weeks, the king of crypto has heartily thriven above its $49K resistance with its chart promising to continue in a bullish trend. As of this writing, Bitcoin sits comfortably at $57,171 and seems to be gearing towards another upward trend."
2024-02-27 16:23:22+00:00,Warning: Bitcoin Halving And Ethereum Upgrade Are Already Priced In,https://blockzeit.com/warning-bitcoin-halving-and-ethereum-upgrade-are-already-priced-in/,"Analysts at JPMorgan Chase recently gave their forecasts on the pivotal events happening in the two largest cryptocurrencies in the world by market cap. The key narratives driving optimism in Bitcoin and Ethereum right now are the Ethereum Dencun (Deneb and Cancun) upgrade in March, the Bitcoin halving in April, and the anticipated nod on spot Ethereum ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). BTC had two game-changing events this year. It kicked off with the mass approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 11. The new financial instruments paved the way for the wider institutional exposure and adoption of BTC while the billions of cashflows have resulted in a bump in the demand for its underlying asset. However, the biggest thing occurring in its ecosystem is the approaching halving estimated between April 18 and 20. As its name says, the affair will reduce Bitcoin mining rewards from the present 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This will heighten the competition among miners while triggering a tighter supply for the crypto asset. Before the halving though will be Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade around March 13. In a nutshell, this will enhance ETH’s scalability, security, and efficiency via proto-danksharding. Meanwhile, more demand for ETH is foreseen with its impending rise in institutional adoption through spot ETFs. Similar to spot Bitcoin ETFs, these investment vehicles track the market price of their underlying asset without actually buying ETH. Loyal fans of the cryptocurrency expect them to generate massive cash flows similar to their Bitcoin-based counterparts while boosting demand for Ether. The analysts at JPMorgan have low expectations of the incoming events. Furthermore, they are not so sure about the possible outcome of the spot Ethereum ETF filings. “We believe that the first two catalysts (Dencun and halving) are largely priced in, while for the third catalyst (spot Ethereum ETFs) we only see a 50% chance,” the financial institution’s strategists reported. The latest assessment of the firm’s experts echoes the same warnings we got as the countdown to the arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs came near. Then, by the time the SEC gave its go signal, all bullish momentum was lost when a “sell the news” incident took over the market. With that, investors should tread with caution if they decide to bet on these important occasions for BTC and ETH."

The overall cryptocurrency market also witnessed a surge in price to hit $2.22 trillion after Bitcoin alone surged by 10% in the last 24 hours. This surge marked a significant approach to surpassing the $53,000 resistance zone during the American trading session. The Bitcoin price surged in seconds to record the highest mark since November 2021, reaching $57,200. The recent Bitcoin trade has been bullish, showing a steady price increase in the last two weeks. The bullish trend in Bitcoin’s recent trades has been evident in the previous two weeks, showing a steady price increase. Before the surge, the market was relatively quiet, with prices moving sideways. However, a shift occurred during the U.S. trading session as Bitcoin surpassed the $53,000 resistance zone and cleared out the $54,000 region, and during the Asian session, the price surged above $57,000 to set a new high record at $57,2000 early Tuesday. It's official..the New Nine Bitcoin ETFs have broken all time volume record today with $2.4b, just barely beating Day One but about double their recent daily average. $IBIT went wild accounting for $1.3b of it, breaking its record by about 30%. pic.twitter.com/MiCs1rzttM The surge in the price of Bitcoin can be attributed to various factors. Since the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Spot Bitcoin ETF on Jan 11, analysts have noted a surge in the inflow volume of Spot Bitcoin ETF, recording a high of $2.4 billion and installing confidence in investors. Notably, speculation about the upcoming halving event is projecting the asset price. Halving creates scarcity in the market, making Bitcoin more challenging to obtain and consequently boosting its price. Additionally, fear of missing out (FOMO) has led investors to enter the market, further raising the asset’s price. The extended momentum stretched beyond Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin also saw a significant increase in the crypto market. Ethereum witnessed a surge in price to reach the $3,273 mark, its highest level since 2022. On the flip of the coin, Dogecoin rose above an obstacle by 5.36% in the last 24 hours to hit $0.089. The asset has increased 57% more than its rival, Shiba Inu; will it make $1? As for Bitcoin, at the time of writing, the asset was trading at $56,210 with +8.36% trading volume in the last 24 hours. "
2024-02-27 11:51:08+00:00,Bitcoin Price Surges To New Yearly Highs As MicroStrategy Buys More BTC,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-surges-as-microstrategy-buys-more-btc/,"Bitcoin reached a new yearly high of $57,055 on Tuesday, February 27, 2024, as MicroStrategy, announced that it had purchased an additional 3,000 BTC for $155 million. MicroStrategy, which has been accumulating Bitcoin since August 2020, now holds a total of 193,000 BTC, worth about $7.6 billion at current prices. The company said it bought the latest batch of bitcoins at an average price of $51,813 per bitcoin, including fees and expenses. The company’s CEO, Michael Saylor, has been a vocal advocate of Bitcoin, calling it a “dependable store of value” and a “compelling investment asset”. He has also encouraged other companies and institutions to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. MicroStrategy’s announcement came amid a strong rally in the crypto market, driven by growing institutional and retail demand, as well as positive developments in the regulatory and technological fronts.  Bitcoin has gained more than 34% since the start of the year, outperforming most traditional assets. On the daily chart, BTC is still above the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA), which shows a bullish trend. However, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is in the overbought region (85).  At around RSI level of 88-90, Bitcoin price may experience a possible reversal soon Bitcoin is now eyeing $58,000. If BTC breaks above $58,000, it could trigger a rally that could push the price higher to $61,000 and $64,000.  If BTC breaks below $50,000, it could crash down further to $47,000, $43,000, and $39,000. Even though Bitcoin has struggled to reclaim $57,000, the markets should not rejoice yet. Bitcoin halving is about 2 months away and smart money is still accumulating. A black swan event is looming and investors should be cautious as they trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies."
2024-02-27 08:21:30+00:00,"Breaking News: Bitcoin Pops Near The $57,000 Range",https://blockzeit.com/breaking-news-bitcoin-pops-near-the-57000-range/,"Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) were widespread as Bitcoin’s trajectory went sluggishly sideways after losing the resistance zone at $53K a couple of weeks ago. However, little did the shills know that it was just building up momentum for what was to come. And just like that, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy suddenly announced its massive BTC accumulation yesterday, which served as a catalyst for the latest boost of the Bitcoin bandwagon. From there, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap steadily climbed to another record high not witnessed for more than two years. MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 3,000 BTC for ~$155 million at an average price of $51,813 per #bitcoin. As of 2/25/24, @MicroStrategy now hodls 193,000 $BTC acquired for ~$6.09 billion at an average price of $31,544 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/micudbYf3P Saylor broke the news yesterday about his company’s additional 3,000 BTC acquisition to the tune of approximately $155 million. The recent purchase increased the haul of MicroStrategy to 193,000 BTC, which was bought for a sum of $6.09 billion at an average price of $31,544 per Bitcoin. Just more than an hour past the explosive update of MicroStrategy’s chief executive, Bitcoin gradually found its footing for another rush above $52K all the way to its current top. With that, the digital treasure cove of the Bitcoin development company has grown its unrealized earnings to $11 billion, which is almost double its investment already. From the looks of it, Bitcoin’s stampede is far from over as the green candlestick remains lit this trading session. Against the backdrop of this major announcement was a major development in the spot Bitcoin ETFs sector as BlackRock had a record day with these new investment vehicles. Hot on the heels of MicroStrategy’s disclosure and the looming halving, the world’s largest investment company boasted over 42 million iShares traded on Monday, roughly equivalent to $1.3 billion. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC, Bitcoin is treading the $56,400 mark with an increase of over 9.8% on the 24-hour chart of CoinMarketCap. Trading volume for the digital asset also rose by a whopping 234% as $48.54 billion worth of BTC moved between crypto exchanges and wallets within the timeframe. The jump in price likewise propped the market cap of Bitcoin around $1.11 trillion as it moved between a low of $50,931 and a peak of $56,728 within the same period. The new multi-year record-high of the digital currency now narrows the gap from its all-time high of $68,789 on November 10, 2021, by 18.52%."

The company now holds 193,000 BTC, which was acquired for around $6.09 billion at an average price of $31,544 per BTC. MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 3,000 BTC for ~$155 million at an average price of $51,813 per #bitcoin. As of 2/25/24, @MicroStrategy now hodls 193,000 $BTC acquired for ~$6.09 billion at an average price of $31,544 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/micudbYf3P The recent move of the company under Saylor’s guidance as its chief executive only reaffirms its commitment to the cryptocurrency with the largest market cap right now. Their unwavering faith in the digital asset also aligns with their recent rechristening as a “Bitcoin development company.” As of 3:00 PM UTC, the news about MicroStrategy’s recent Bitcoin purchase appears to have already been picked up by the market. During this trading period, Bitcoin is hovering along the $52,300 line with a 24-hour gain of 1.2%. Meanwhile, the transaction volume rose by 20% as $18.8 billion worth of BTC changed hands between crypto exchanges and wallets. At this point, the digital asset continues to exhibit some signs of upward momentum as its prices are going between a low of $50,931 and a high of $52,350 during the same timeframe. At current prices, the 193,000 BTC of MicroStrategy would already be worth around $10.09 billion. That’s over $4 billion in unrealized gains for the company. But then again, as Saylor previously emphasized, they have no plans of selling their supply. For Saylor, Bitcoin is the superior asset class when compared to the Magnificent Seven Stocks. That’s because unlike them, BTC’s ecosystem has the capital structure to hold $10 trillion or up to $100 trillion worth of capital. With that, the exec made it clear that they weren’t looking to settle for the losers. “We believe capital is going to keep flowing from those asset classes into Bitcoin because Bitcoin is technically superior to those asset classes and that being the case, there’s just no reason to sell the winner and to buy the losers,” the investor and business executive explained during an interview with Bloomberg. And don’t even talk to Saylor about what their exit strategy is when it comes to their Bitcoin purchases. The last time he was asked about it, he firmly answered, “Bitcoin is the exit strategy.”"
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2024-02-26 09:47:21+00:00,Bitcoin Mining Firms Find A New Ally In US Senator Cynthia Lummis,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-mining-firms-find-a-new-ally-in-us-senator-cynthia-lummis/,"A debate ensued in the legislature on Friday as senators were divided between the issue concerning the EIA survey on Bitcoin (BTC) mining firms. In consideration of the injunction filed in the court by the Texas Blockchain Council, the energy department announced a temporary halt on the ongoing probe until a judgment is passed down. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis was one of the outspoken critics of the government’s recent move, so she commended the EIA’s decision to suspend the proceedings. The American politician believes that such an action could give way to regulatory overreach, which could hamper innovation. Senator Lummis sided with Bitcoin miners, particularly those that have shown a shift toward sustainable energy sources. Overall, she thinks the sector could bring about a positive impact on US energy grids and pave the way for the development of more self-sufficient and renewable mining solutions in the long run. She likewise urged industry players to explore Bitcoin mining opportunities in her home state. Based on the study by the University of Cambridge Judge Business School, Bitcoin mining consumes approximately 176.06 Terawatt hours (TWh) annually. The US has a slice of around 22.5% of the figures while China and Kazakhstan are estimated at 30.2% and 11.3%, respectively. With the coming Bitcoin halving wherein rewards will be reduced from the current 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, analysts expect Bitcoin miners to upgrade or switch to more sustainable and renewable energy sources to lessen their operational expenses and ensure profits. Meanwhile, the US is now shifting to renewable energy resources like solar and wind. However, the output of these resources is often put to waste when demand is low. Bitcoin miners can help rebalance the utilization of energy in the grid by adjusting their operating parameters down when public demand is high or amping up their rigs when overall demand is low. The latter presents a great way to monetize excess energy, and in turn, let the government generate more taxes from the income of BTC mining businesses."
2024-02-26 06:33:52+00:00,The European Central Bank Says Bitcoin Has Zero Fair Value,https://blockzeit.com/the-european-central-bank-says-bitcoin-has-zero-fair-value/,"The ECB recently criticized Bitcoin in a blog post despite the digital currency’s recent rally and growing institutional adoption sparked by the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US and the upcoming halving. It strongly opposed the notion that all these factors can be considered a victory for BTC because it has zero net fair value and it only follows a boom-bust cycle wherein the ensuing “collateral damage will be massive.” The central bank, referencing its post in November 2022, reiterated how BTC is rarely utilized in legal transactions because it is transactions are “cumbersome, slow, and expensive.” Meanwhile, regulations toward the digital asset as often misconstrued by its supporters as approval. Likewise, banks embracing or promoting it are at risk of having their reputations tarnished due to its volatility. The ECB said that outside of the darknet, where all kinds of illicit activities occur, Bitcoin is hardly used as payment. The organization called it the “currency of crime: financing evil” because it is still being utilized by criminals and terrorists to finance to fund their operations or move their money due to a lack of regulatory initiatives to combat them. The ECB also pointed out that even the full endorsement of the El Salvador government, which made it a legal tender coupled with $30 worth of free satoshis (sats) to its citizens, failed to kickstart positive changes in Bitcoin’s network. Bitcoin was slammed for its inability to generate cash flows like real estate or dividends similar to equities. Additionally, it cannot be used productively like commodities and has no social benefits akin to gold. Furthermore, it is not driven by “subjective appreciation based on outstanding abilities” such as works of art. The lack of cash flow makes BTC’s fair value zero based on the ECB’s assessment. The central bank also noted that it’s a pitfall for “less financially knowledgeable retain investors” who regularly flock to the coin due to fear of missing out (FOMO). The ECB even went on to dismiss the surge in Bitcoin prices as nothing but a “dead cat bounce” that will eventually tank to reflect the digital asset’s true valuation. Of course, the ECB didn’t miss out on the opportunity to highlight the energy use of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism. It stated that the cryptocurrency “continues to pollute the environment on the same scale as entire countries.” It adds that the energy consumption of BTC is aggravated by its rising prices, as the resulting higher production costs incentivize Bitcoin mining firms to continue profiting. Citing a Forbes report in 2022, the ECB revealed that 157 crypto exchanges identified 51% of daily Bitcoin trading volume as bogus. The financial institution also noted how scams were prevalent in the earlier cycles of Bitcoin. For an asset with no fair value, such activities are not surprising at all according to the central bank. The recent blog post of the ECB certainly highlights a damning view on Bitcoin. However, most factors presented here kept a selective scope to paint a darker image of BTC. It failed to mention that there are now solutions for the issues frequently raised regarding the digital asset. For example, Lightning Network offers a Layer 2 scaling solution to fix Bitcoin’s sluggish and expensive transactions. Then, it fails to touch the new use cases unlocked for Bitcoin like Ordinals, which further supports its value. The other points of contention of the ECB echoed the same sentiments aired by Vanguard in rejecting Bitcoin ETFs saying it is based on “an immature asset class that has little history, no inherent economic value, no cash flow, and can create havoc within a portfolio” to which we tried our best to straight-up refute in a previous article."
2024-02-26 04:00:00+00:00,Conversations Between Adam Back And Bitcoin Inventor Satoshi Nakamoto Officially Surface,https://blockzeit.com/conversations-between-adam-back-and-bitcoin-inventor-satoshi-nakamoto-officially-surface/,"Last week, early Bitcoin contributors Adam Back and Martti ‘Sirius’ Malmi took the witness stand in a London court to testify in a case filed by the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA) against Dr. Craig Wright. The lawsuit aims to get the court’s “negative declaration” of the latter’s claim that he’s the person behind the alias Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. The testimonies of the witnesses were anchored from their past interactions with the pseudonymous BTC inventor, who they firmly confirmed was not Wright. The information concerning their statements in court is still scarce, but thanks to Bitcoin Magazine, we just discovered the official records of the correspondence between Back and Satoshi. This marks the first time for these conversations to be released public, although Back has already hinted about them a lot in his previous interviews. The papers reaffirm his prior tales on how he initially ignored the Bitcoin whitepaper when it was sent to him by Satoshi. These also somehow help quell the speculations that the chief executive of Blockstream and inventor of Hashcash may have been the cryptographer responsible for the digital asset that paved the way for the cryptocurrency revolution. Here is a quick examination of the communication between Back and Satoshi from the development phase and release of Bitcoin: The first email shows Satoshi informing Back of a peer-to-peer (P2P) electronic cash that utilizes Hashcash’s hash-based proof-of-work (PoW) concept to make sure that each transaction is immutable and protected against double-spending. The mysterious developer can also be seen modestly asking for the accuracy of the citations he placed on the attached prototype Bitcoin whitepaper. The next conversation indicates that Back has not yet read Satoshi’s document but he does find a similarity between the proposed P2P e-cash with Wei Dai’s B-Money concept. This is followed by Satoshi thanking Back for providing references to Dei’s work. Then, the Bitcoin inventor offers another rundown on how it adds PoW to support coin generation and network timestamping instead of relying on Usenet. Back admits in his reply about not reading Satoshi’s whitepaper yet. However, he mentions one more paper related to the matter from Rivest called MicroMint. The last notifies Back of the Bitcoin whitepaper’s release and thanking him for his insights. Satoshi clarifies that the system employs a hash-based PoW operation to generate a chain (now known as the blockchain) as a sort of ledger for the majority consensus and to reward users with new coins. The same email names software developer Hal Finney as another collaborator in Bitcoin’s crafting. The email generally shows cordial communication between Back and Satoshi. It also does not give us anything about the enigmatic Bitcoin developer’s true identity, which leads us to believe that the one he was talking to had no idea about it as well. If this is the case, there shouldn’t be any more worries about potentially comprising the anonymity of Satoshi."
2024-02-25 05:12:06+00:00,Max Keiser: The Government “Can Certainly Seize” Bitcoin Held By ETFs And Takeover Miners,https://blockzeit.com/max-keiser-the-government-can-certainly-seize-bitcoin-held-by-etfs-and-takeover-miners/,"By design, Bitcoin is built within a decentralized world space via the blockchain. That means no other entity, even the government, can seize or manipulate it. However, the same cannot be said if they decide to take control of the supply held by a wallet. This is the concern raised by Bitcoin proponent Max Keiser in response to the potential asset seizure of Donald Trump if he fails to fork out the $355 million penalty hammered down by Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron in favor of New York Attorney General Letitia James. “If they can do this to Trump, they can certainly seize Bitcoin held in BTC ETFs and commandeer US BTC miners,” said Keiser’s recent post on X. “Self-custody or lose it.” If they can do this to Trump they can certainly seize #Bitcoin held in BTC ETF’s & commandeer US BTC miners. Self-custody or lose it. https://t.co/sk7C1oK1p2 As of December 2023, the US government has an estimated haul of 205,515 BTC, which is worth around $10.58 billion based on Sunday’s (February 25, 2024) prevailing rates at $51,500 per BTC. The hoard didn’t come from purchases but through a series of busts. It just goes on to show that the government could take over a person or a group’s Bitcoin supply or other digital assets if it finds a legal reason to do so. The administration could also confiscate or gain control of Bitcoin mining rigs if they get out of bounds within existing laws. Although it couldn’t just seize a wallet or vault without just cause or court order, just imagine how such a scenario could play out in the hands of a corrupt or dictatorial regime. This makes Keiser’s caution hold water, albeit its remote possibility that the US government would suddenly decide to do so—unless they are willing to risk getting the ire of cryptocurrency users and supporters as well as powerhouse financial institutions with their products or services anchored on Bitcoin. In an earlier post, Keiser likewise voiced out his bleak forecast of the US economy that could mirror the 1987 stock market crash. This came as a reaction to The Kobeissi Letter’s data reflecting a concentration of approximately 75% of the entire market in the top 10% stocks, which simulates the same buildup to the financial crises in 1931, 2001, and 2008. Keiser believes the event could push Bitcoin to $500K while demonetizing gold along the way. He also foresees an outcome where El Salvador could benefit from the fallout of the market collapse. 1987-style crash coming. #Bitcoin, the ultimate safe haven, will soar past $500,000 Gold will continue getting demonetized by #Bitcoin BTC ETF’s (& domestic BTC miners) will get seized by U.S. gov. 1 million middle & upper class migrants will flood into #ElSalvador https://t.co/zx3NbrkV5m The numbers are a significant bump up from his previous $200K per BTC estimates. However, no timeframe is mentioned as to when the event will likely occur."
2024-02-24 07:54:10+00:00,Riot Platforms Poses A Bleak Outlook On Bitcoin Mining Past The Halving,https://blockzeit.com/riot-platforms-poses-bleak-outlook-on-bitcoin-mining-past-halving/,"Riot Platforms, one the largest players in the Bitcoin mining industry, posed a dire outlook for the coming halving. The company warned there will be “no guarantee” that it will bring about positive changes in its profitability. “While Bitcoin prices have historically increased around these halving events, there is no guarantee that the price change will be favorable or would compensate for the reduction in mining rewards,” said Riot in its 2023 Fiscal-Year Annual Report submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). “If a corresponding and proportionate increase in the price of Bitcoin does not follow future halving events, the revenue we earn from our Bitcoin Mining operations would see a decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.” The notice came even with the expected deployment of the new rigs Riot purchased that should bump their hash rate from the present 12.4 exahash per second (EH/s) to 28 EH/s by the end of 2024. The filing also noted an increase of their Bitcoin yield by 19.3% last year, growing from 5,554 BTC in 2022 to 6,626 BTC in 2023. Another cause of concern mentioned by Riot was the long-term effects of tightening regulations in the Bitcoin mining sector. The large-scale Bitcoin miner believes that the following factors could have a major effect on the industry: Nonetheless, Riot assured that the State of Texas where its Rockdale and Corsicana Facilities are situated will “remain one of the most favorable regulatory environments for Bitcoin miners.” Likewise, the company guaranteed, “We continue to monitor and proactively engage in dialogue on regulatory and legislative matters related to our industry.” Furthermore, the company warned that the ongoing supply chain crisis, aggravated by the strong demand for computer chips, may slow down its acquisition of new application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips. Thus, this may have a significant effect on its future growth."
2024-02-23 12:02:25+00:00,"Market Wrap: BTC Finds Support At $50,000, Bears And Bulls Fight It Out In A Consolidation Zone",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-bears-and-bulls-fight-it-out-in-50k-consolidation-zone/,"Bitcoin (BTC) dominance reduced in the past 7 days, indicating that altcoins have been running. Ether (ETH), the king of the Altcoins registered heavy gains, and broke past the $3,000 level, with other notable coins like Worldcoin (WLD) gaining immensely against BTC and USDT. Last week, Bitcoin was bullish, even though the $53k level presented a resistance zone. The bulls showed some weakness after a candle with a long upper wick flashed on the 4-hour chart. The fight was on between the bears and bulls. However, BTC entered into a consolidation, ranging between $53,015 and $50,600.  Although currently in a range, BTC bulls are looking to hit the $55,000 psychological barrier soon.  Key support areas to watch for are $50,600, $49,600, $48,900, and $47,200 while key resistance areas to look for are $52,800, $54,100, and $56,000. The 100-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) provide strong support at $49,600 and $47,400. Investors are looking for a catalyst to push BTC past the $50,000 resistance, after which all eyes will be on $60,000 and after that, the previous all-time high price. Should the bulls win the fight in the current consolidation, expect to see BTC at $55,000 next week. If bears win, the asset could easily tumble down to $48,900.

2024-02-22 19:46:25+00:00,"Spot Bitcoin ETFs Are A Giant Mistake, Says Jim Bianco",https://blockzeit.com/spot-bitcoin-etfs-are-a-giant-mistake-says-jim-bianco/,"Bianco thinks the Spot Bitcoin ETFs are not as good for crypto as everyone thinks because they are not “decentralized.” As per his social media post, he’s been a big fan of BTC, ETFs, and decentralized alternatives and even held Bitcoin for over seven years. However, his reservations about the spot ETF stem from the fact that BTC is playing into the hands of the centralized system against which BTC founders operated. “The idea that BTC will change the centralized system is a pure fallacy,” said Bianco.  For him, it’s only a matter of time before the centralized system makes an unexpected move on the spot ETF brokerage accounts, providers, and exchanges, leveraging regulatory compliance to force them to play by its rules. He believes the centralized system will be patient enough till a spot BTC ETF “gets big enough” before initiating their control as usual. Bianco cited what happened to gold in 1934, when President Roosevelt signed the Gold Reserve Act into law, retrieving gold ownership in the US to the Treasury. All monetary gold, including coins and bullion held by individuals and institutions, even the Federal Reserve, had their ownership transferred to the US Treasury. All that was in a bid to stabilize the dollar’s worth and send more money into circulation by giving out $35 per ounce of gold received. The renowned financial strategist and analyst is very confident that when the centralized Leviathan is ready, “they’ll do the same to spot BTC ETFs” as they did to gold in 1934 when they considered it a “problem. Bianco reemphasized that the “spot bitcoin ETF Is a giant mistake” in the Coin Stories podcast with journalist Natalie Brunel. While he agrees it will produce higher prices based on the greater exposure it gives investors to BTC and other factors, he says “everybody is going to get $60K” per Bitcoin. “You better be able to live off that for the rest of your lives, you’re not getting no million,” he added. Contrarily, Brunel herself believes that “Bitcoin will win with or without the ETFs.” The Spot Bitcoin ETF, says Bianco, is “an admission of failure.” He sees it as the industry stakeholders taking the easy way out and asking customers to buy from their “brokerage account” instead of dealing with the UX (user experience) and private key problems that beset the industry. The major red light he senses is that the massive institutional involvement we now see with Bitcoin is a web that will trap the asset in the centralized system’s net and impose limitations and control on it similar to the situation with Gold. “You’re going to get higher prices over the short term. And the problem is the whole damn place is run by a bunch of Degens…All They want is number go up. They are not thinking bigger picture of what it is we are attempting to do. Because if you had thought bigger picture of what it is you’re attempting to do, you wouldn’t be for the spot Bitcoin ETFs,” said Bianco. Bianco’s take on the spot Bitcoin ETFs is quite unconventional when juxtaposed with the popular belief that the ETFs are one of the best things that have happened since Bitcoin’s launch. While many a crypto fan may not buy everything he said, there are points to pick and improvements to make to keep the crypto industry completely decentralized and as far as possible from the centralized system’s influence. It’s a call to develop more decentralized investment alternatives and deal with any prevalent issues in the cryptocurrency industry."
2024-02-22 10:01:05+00:00,Early Bitcoin Contributors Demolish Craig Wright’s Claim,https://blockzeit.com/early-bitcoin-contributors-demolish-craig-wrights-claim/,"NEW: Early #Bitcoin contributors Adam Back and Martti 'Sirius' Malmi took the stand in the UK todayThey refuted the claim that Craig Wright is Satoshi 👏 pic.twitter.com/oYVmueQYoT On February 21, two prominent personalities in the cryptocurrency community stepped up to further put a nail in the case filed by the COPA against Wright for the latter’s incessant claim that he’s Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic cryptographer responsible for Bitcoin. Back and Malmi stated under oath that they had interactions with the mysterious BTC inventor back in the 2000s and denied it was the defendant in the case. Other details of their testimonies and court transcripts are yet to surface but some legal experts believe the recent developments could add to the pile of facts that could demolish Wright’s defense. The ongoing hearing is a part of the legal procedure related to the lawsuit filed by COPA in 2021 to have a “negative declaration” of Wright’s over-the-top proclamations that he’s Satoshi. The organization is composed of prominent names in crypto and FinTech, including Twitter (now known as X) founder Jack Dorsey’s Block payment portal, Brian Armstrong’s Coinbase crypto exchange, and Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, to name a few. The case aims to “conclusively show that Dr. Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto and will not be able to continue to threaten developers.” COPA questioned the documents Wright produced in the past to back his claim as the creator of now the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The complainant said the respondent’s supposed shreds of evidence were nothing but forgeries. Likewise, Wright has time and again failed to conclusively demonstrate that he’s Satoshi. One instance refuting Wright was the Bitcoin whitepaper he produced, which didn’t match the formatting and the software used by the original. The document’s metadata also revealed that the file was only made in November 2023. However, the most damning evidence that Wright has been a farce so far is his inability to access the initial 1.1 million BTC mined by Satoshi. At the latest top of Bitcoin at nearly $53,000, that haul is already approximately $58.3 billion. With that kind of money, there’s no longer a reason for him to chase after other developers for just a couple of billions in lawsuits. To his defense, Wright told people that he already destroyed the hard drive containing the keys to the over a million BTC haul. A pretty convenient excuse but a super counterintuitive move on his part. The author of this article hopes the case will finally be decided in favor of COPA as it does not take rocket science to decipher that there are a lot of plot holes in Wright’s script. Acts like these only serve to diminish the greatest gift and sacrifice Satoshi ever gave to the world: that is making Bitcoin and walking away from it to fully reflect the vision of decentralization for his creation. What truly elevates Bitcoin among other cryptocurrencies is the fact that it has no leader, central government, or claim of ownership. It’s just pure mathematical magic. On the other hand, the testimonies of Back and Malmi are in danger of opening a can of worms that could ultimately compromise the anonymity of Satoshi if they were to be grilled during cross-examination and they would be compelled to reveal the true identity of the mysterious Bitcoin creator. Let’s hope everyone’s prepared for that."
2024-02-22 05:53:53+00:00,Ethiopia Signs MOU For A $250M National Bitcoin Mining Project,https://blockzeit.com/ethiopia-signs-mou-for-a-250m-national-bitcoin-mining-project/,"Ethiopia is gearing up to become the first country in the African continent to establish a national Bitcoin mining project. This comes after Ethiopian Investment Holdings (EIH), the country’s investment arm, inked a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with West Data Group, a Hong Kong FinTech firm powered by blockchain. The general agreement involves a $250 million venture classified as a “data mining project” operated by the parties. According to Forbes, it is “dedicated to establishing cutting-edge infrastructure for data mining and artificial intelligence training operations in Ethiopia.” Meanwhile, Hashlabs Mining CEO Kal Kassa remarked “The development is part of the Ethiopian Government’s aim to drive economic growth by leveraging technology and energy sources to attract foreign investments.” The partnership aligns with the nation’s goal of strategically positioning itself as a data hub in the African continent. Based on estimates, the sector is expected to soar by $5.4 billion three years from now. Ethiopia currently ranks fourth in Luxor Technologies’ list of top Bitcoin mining destinations globally. Citing a Bitmain senior executive’s projection, the nation has the potential to trump Texas’ mining capacity, which makes up 28.5% of the 40% global hashrate owned by the US. Now operating in the country are Bitcluster and Hashlabs Mining. There are, however, some concerns about the limited energy production in Ethiopia where around 120 million or 40% of its population still have no access to electricity. This is despite the installation of over 5,000 MW facility and another 5,150 MW hydroelectric plant coming up from the Grand Ethiopia Renaissance Dam (GERD). Bitcoin miners also face the uncertainty of future regulations in the country. To date, it enforces a ban on cryptocurrency trading but has ratified laws allowing “high-performance computing” and “data mining. The latter is the category where Bitcoin mining operations fall. Nevertheless, there are no fixed or clear-cut rules specifically addressing BTC mining in Ethiopia. Investors fear that it might shift its stance once these entities start competing with local energy demand as shown in the cases of Iran and Kazakhstan. EIH is yet to comment on the framework of its planned Bitcoin mining operations. Nonetheless, it’s expected to follow the lead of similar projects in Africa that tap into renewable green energy as sources. From there, any excess energy is redirected to the energy demand of communities. Likewise, the contribution of these projects to the gross domestic product (GDP) of the nation can be used to improve the economy as well as the quality of life of its citizens through the enhancement of basic education, technical training, and other livelihood missions. Project Mano estimates that Bitcoin mining could potentially contribute $2 billion to $4 billion in Ethiopia’s GDP."
2024-02-21 06:56:10+00:00,"MicroStrategy Already Has $10B In Bitcoin, Michael Saylor Affirms They’re Not Selling",https://blockzeit.com/microstrategy-already-has-10b-in-bitcoin-michael-saylor-affirms-theyre-not-selling/,"MicroStrategy’s executive chairman and co-founder, Michael Saylor, recently sat down for an interview with Bloomberg TV. Being one of the poster boys of the Bitcoin revolution, the topic naturally centered on the digital asset and what his company is planning to do with their massive haul. Early this month, Saylor revealed that MicroStrategy scooped up an additional 850 BTC to its digital vault for $37.2 million. This brings up their total holdings to 190,000 BTC, which was acquired for a total price of $5.93 billion or $31,224 per coin. At the current top of $52,900 price per BTC, this translates to $10.051 billion. That’s nearly double their investment already. So, one thing that the crypto community and the mass media are very interested in at the moment is when will they cash out their profits. Saylor, however, reaffirmed his previous stance that there are no plans to sell MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin supply anytime soon, or even anytime in the long run. This is especially true now that there’s a growing institutional demand created by spot ETFs based on the digital asset. “The spot ETFs have opened up a gateway for institutional capital to flow into the Bitcoin ecosystem,” Saylor told Bloomberg. “If you look at what these spot ETFs are doing, they are facilitating the digital transformation of capital, and every day hundreds of millions of dollars of capital is flowing from the traditional analog ecosystem into the digital economy.” For Saylor, “Bitcoin is the exit strategy” and it is presently the “strongest asset” out there. Its resurgence to the trillion-dollar market cap now positions itself among other powerhouses in the tech sector like Microsoft, Apple, and Google (Alphabet). What makes Bitcoin different from the Magnificent Seven Stocks though is it’s an asset class and not a company. Likewise, he emphasized that there’s not enough room in the capital structure of the mentioned companies to hold $10 trillion up to $100 trillion worth of capital. “We believe capital is going to keep flowing from those asset classes into Bitcoin because Bitcoin is technically superior to those asset classes and that being the case, there’s just no reason to sell the winner and to buy the losers,” the investor and business executive explained."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2024-02-20 09:36:31+00:00,10X Research Founder Thinks Bitcoin Will Surpass Its ATH Pre-Halving,https://blockzeit.com/10x-research-founder-thinks-bitcoin-will-surpass-its-ath-pre-halving/,"Early on, there were projections about Bitcoin rallying before the halving but it will likely fall short of its record peak at $68,789 in November 2021. The previous analysis was anchored on the fact that BTC still has a lot of catching up to do to fill in the $350 billion gap in its market cap in order to reach the $70K target from the $52K level. Nonetheless, it appears that the cryptocurrency has already established its support this week at $51K. With that, it now sits on the top 10 tradable assets worldwide within the past 30 days. This gives a flicker of optimism that it might just be capable of achieving such heights again or even surpassing its established ATH. According to 10X Research Founder Markus Thielen’s interview with Coindesk, Bitcoin is already positioning itself for a surge going at an average of 32% in 60 days. Right now, we are approximately 63 days away from the pivotal event in the BTC ecosystem wherein mining rewards will be halved from the current 6.25 BTC per block to 3.123 BTC per block. Referencing to the performance of Bitcoin prices during the last three epochs of the halving, Thielen believes the fourth cycle will not be any different. With the digital currency’s present value at $52,000, factoring in the 32% boost will take its valuation to $69,000 on or a few days prior to the halving. Despite being a long way from those numbers at the moment, Thielen reinforced his positive outlook with the massive buying pressure being generated by traditional finance (TradFi) players through their aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At the time of Thielen’s analysis, Bitcoin was treading the 80 mark on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator. Normally, anything more than 70 is a sign that an asset is already overbought or overvalued. However, the 10X Research founder is looking at it from a bullish angle. He noted that this marks the first since December that the 14-day RSI has reached that point. Twelve out of 14 of those cases triggered an average gain of 54% in the next 60 days for Bitcoin. Thielen stated that the signal came up by the time the crypto was trading at $48,294. So, if his theory plays out, BTC could pop as much as $74K before the halving. Once more, do note that the estimates based here do not constitute financial advice coming from the author or Blockzeit team. The facts presented here are merely for information that you may want to consider in your DD. Remember as well that past performance is not always a 100% indicator of future returns."
2024-02-19 15:36:12+00:00,Ruling Party Of South Korea Changes Stance On Spot Bitcoin ETFs,https://blockzeit.com/ruling-party-of-south-korea-changes-stance-on-spot-bitcoin-etfs/,"Previously, the Republic of Korea reiterated its ban on the ownership of cryptocurrencies by financial institutions. This was the official statement of the Yoon Suk Yeol administration despite the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. Citing an unnamed Financial Services Commission official as a source, South Korean news outlet Kyunghyang reported that the country’s financial regulator remained committed to its earlier ruling against institutional crypto investments. “The government has consistently maintained the principle of prohibiting financial institutions from investing in virtual assets in order to stabilize the financial market and protect investors,” said the official. With the next legislative elections happening on April 10 this year, the ruling party of the nation appeared to have softened its stance on institutional crypto ownership. According to South Korea’s News1, the People Power Party pledged to introduce reforms that could eventually allow the entry of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the country. The candidates also promised to seek legislative remedies that could pave the way to the entry of other cryptocurrency-related products that have already been deemed legal in developed countries like the US. Likewise, they are looking for a measure to gradually ease up its crypto ban on institutional investments and initial exchange offerings (IEO). They clarified, however, that they will initially limit the accumulation of crypto assets for investment firms with “investor protection measures” to probably test the waters before allowing banks and insurance firms to take a dip into these products. That way, the protection of user funds by the latter is prioritized. At the same time, the right-wing politicians revealed their plan of creating a “Digital Asset Promotion Committee” that would propose laws, enforce sanctions, and overlook the digital asset sector of the country. Furthermore, they vowed to review the discrepancies in the classification of virtual asset exchanges in the nation’s financial laws. Early on, South Korea’s Ministry of SMEs and Startups categorized them with gambling and entertainment businesses. Along the way, they also endorsed large exchanges Upbit and Bithumb as “unicorns.” The move obviously resonates as an attempt to sway crypto-savvy young voters in the party’s favor. According to the country’s National Tax Agency, around 80% of cryptocurrency holders in the area are within the 20s to 30s age bracket. In a related news from The Block, citing the Herald Business Daily as the source, the People Power Party is studying the possibility of postponing the taxation on crypto gains from 2025 to 2027 to reinforce its appeal to the crypto community."
2024-02-19 12:58:47+00:00,Should You Invest In Bitcoin Mining Companies After Halving?,https://blockzeit.com/should-you-invest-in-bitcoin-mining-companies-after-halving/,"The upcoming halving in its ecosystem is now the central focus of bullish narratives surrounding Bitcoin (BTC). Historically, each occurrence pushed the digital asset to new all-time highs. However, what could the next one mean for Bitcoin mining companies? Is it still safe to invest in them? In a nutshell, the halving slashes the reward generated per block mined within the Bitcoin ecosystem by 50%. This is a cyclical event taking place every 210,000 blocks mined or approximately every four years. The halving is hardcoded within the very design of Bitcoin by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto to ensure its finite supply. Therefore, this is programmed to happen until such time that all 21 million BTC has been mined. Such a trait positions Bitcoin similar to gold, which cannot be inflated artificially. But then again, this also makes BTC more appealing than the precious metal because of its known supply cap aside from its accessibility. The first halving was in 2012, which reduced rewards from the initial 50 BTC to 25 BTC per block mined. The second was in 2016 cutting the booty for miners to 12.5 BTC and the third in 2020 took it to the current level of 6.25 BTC. Now approaching its fourth epoch, the next one will bring it to 3.125 BTC. Doing the math, the last halving should be around 2140. It’s hard to predict the financial landscape more than a century in the future, but at that moment, miners will most probably have to solely rely on yields from BTC transaction fees. Looking at the charts, every halving birthed a new record-high for Bitcoin. The next one will unlikely be an exemption, especially now that there’s already a growing institutional demand for the crypto asset. Applying the basic tenet of the law of supply and demand, the resulting scarcity for BTC is expected to push prices higher. Considering the high correlation of Bitcoin mining stocks to BTC prices, the future certainly looks bright for them. Taking notes from the data collated by The Motley Fool, major BTC mining stocks have pumped significantly over the following 150 days post-halving. To illustrate this, Marathon Digital gained 182% from $0.76 to $2.14 after the 2020 halving. At the same time, Riot Platforms jumped 84% from $1.59 to $2.93. These instances can be attributed to what the source called “the Bitcoin proxy effect.” Furthermore, the reduction in mining rewards should not be a cause of concern. Despite the decrease in BTC gained per block mined, the gradual rise in value of the digital currency should be able to offset those losses. However, such an assumption comes with a caveat. Smaller Bitcoin mining firms will likely be pruned by the event’s aftermath as they will have to contend with large-scale miners like Marathon and Riot that have better access to high-yield, sustainable, and renewable energy sources. With the tighter competition and lower rewards, it would make more sense for them to just close shop, join up with others, or explore other ventures than risk operating at a loss. With that, be sure to exercise due diligence in choosing which Bitcoin mining stocks to invest in. Make sure that they have a solid portfolio and are backed by sustainable resources going forward."
2024-02-19 06:08:19+00:00,"Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Already At 81.73 Trillion, And It’s Not Yet The Halving",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-already-at-81-73-trillion-and-its-not-yet-the-halving/,"The automated readjustment of Bitcoin mining on February 15 resulted in over 80 trillion mining difficulty for Bitcoin (BTC). To date, it now sits at 81.73 trillion, but it is estimated to go down by -2.69% to 79.53 trillion in the next update around 11 days from now. Bitcoin mining difficulty is now at its all-time high (ATH) of over 80 trillion. During this time, the hashrate or the total computational power used by miners has gone up to 559.28 exahashes per second (EH/s) according to the on-chain monitoring of BTC.com. The trend reveals that Bitcoin mining difficulty has constantly soared since January, which coincided with the mass approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The difficulty in mining BTC is estimated to further increase in the months to come with 100 trillion as a possible outcome. This continues the momentum built up last year when the numbers more than doubled. The soaring BTC mining difficulty comes as Bitcoin braces for the halving happening sometime between April 18 to 20. The fourth halving epoch of BTC will occur once the 840,000th block has been mined, and right now, only around 8,900 blocks remain, which raises the stakes for industry players. This will reduce mining rewards from the current 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC. The event is projected to lessen the hash rate of the Bitcoin blockchain as the tighter supply and more aggressive competition will likely result in the shutdown of smaller and less efficient mining operations. This will likely lead to a reduction in mining difficulty to maintain the network’s stability as it works to keep block production every 10 minutes. The latest report of Galaxy forecasts that around a fifth of Bitcoin’s current hashrate will go offline in the aftermath of the halving. This will only leave the most efficient rigs operational, which underscores the need for them to shift to more sustainable power sources going forward. “We estimate that roughly 15-20% of the network hashrate at the conclusion of 2023 (86-115 EH) could come offline at the time of the halving,” said Galaxy. “Based on our analysis, we expected 2024 network hashrate to end in a range between 675 EH and 725 EH.” As of this writing at 6:00 AM UTC, Bitcoin has stagnated within the $52,000 line with only less than a 1% movement in the 24-hour frame. Trading volume is also down by nearly 15% as only $18.27 billion BTC flowed between addresses. During this time, BTC hovered between a low of $51,422 and a high of $52,356. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s market cap is still at $1.021 trillion, which positions it within the top 10 tradable in the world. This is thanks to its surge of over 26% in just a month and 110% within the annual frame."
2024-02-19 04:00:00+00:00,5 Hard Facts Why Corrupt Politicians Should Fear Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/5-hard-facts-why-corrupt-politicians-should-fear-bitcoin/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has its detractors here and there. Mostly, they come from the tools of traditional finance (TradFi) in the government who want to keep the status quo, which they tend to exploit to their advantage. So, what’s in it that they should fear about? Many politicians go on hating Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies not because of their perceived risks to people’s finances or their claimed intensive energy use. These are merely convenient excuses to immediately dismiss the benefits of BTC without even understanding the very fabric of its design that even surpasses gold as a hard asset. While we recognize that there are still a lot of politicians who genuinely care for the benefit of their constituents, the same cannot apply to everyone. As with any other institution out there, there will always be the pressing challenges of corruption in each government that need to be addressed. Without much ado, here’s a rundown on five hard facts that make Bitcoin the ideal currency to safeguard everyone’s financial autonomy against political corruption: The decentralized nature of Bitcoin means no single entity, government, or corporation could control, manipulate, or shut it down. It requires a concerted effort from the consensus of its overall user base to enact changes in its inner workings, hence, it reflects the true essence of democracy, equity, and inclusivity. This goes in opposition to traditional finance entities that have inherent biases over their clients, governing bodies, or owners. Even fiat money is no exception because its value can be adjusted by monetary and fiscal policies that usually favor the government. It cannot be denied that there are whales who hold a significant supply of Bitcoin, which could theoretically exert massive selling pressure in the market if they decide to jointly flush all their BTC holdings. However, the digital asset has always found ways to undergo correction whenever the smoke has cleared without any form of government intervention or bailout. Thanks to its cyclical halving, the trajectory of the cryptocurrency has remained upward on a long-term scale. Likewise, its demand due to its potential utility in payments and money-transmitting sectors could further offset any attempts to drive down its price. Lack of transparency has time and again proven itself to be the natural breeding ground of corruption. The blockchain is a public ledger that can track transactions as they happen, thus, it presents an effective tool for taxation and catching money laundering attempts. While there have been criminals caught washing their dirty money via Bitcoin, let’s consider the fact that most of them have been exposed via the breadcrumbs they left in the blockchain. Meanwhile, the immutability of the Bitcoin blockchain ensures that transactions and their corresponding data cannot be altered or tampered with. Both of these provide an effective instrument to combat alterations to hide any criminal wrongdoings like embezzlement, bribery, vote buying, and other crooked practices. Again, due to its decentralized nature, Bitcoin couldn’t be used to censor or influence the populace because of its permissionless system. Anyone, even the unbanked or marginalized sector of the community can participate in its ecosystem. Most governments and politicians generally hate something they can’t control, so the idea of people having autonomy in their dealings and having a choice on how they run their finances just irks them to the core. Fiat currency can be printed by the government on a whim to align with its fiscal goals, but the same cannot be said for Bitcoin because of its finite supply of 21 million BTC. This characteristic makes it resistant to the inflationary pressures often caused by incompetent, inconsiderate, or irresponsible monetary solutions pushed forth by policymakers like quantitative easing. The incessant money printing of governments like the US to support their agendas has always been to the detriment of people as they caused prices of goods and services to skyrocket. Bitcoin’s hard supply cap coupled with its decentralized economy, however, ensures that everyone has a voice in its future direction. Bitcoin like gold transcends the boundaries set forth by governments. The cryptographic framework of BTC makes it challenging for regulators and politicians to enforce controls to manipulate its exchange rates or use them to their advantage. Bitcoin’s lack of geographical boundaries or regulatory restriction by a single entity or a collective is the very reason why it’s seen as freedom money. These hard facts only form the tip of the proverbial tip of the iceberg. Furthermore, these may be debatable at best, but they do present an exciting kick-off for discussions aimed at combating the fallacies critics mostly throw at Bitcoin, especially the obviously uninformed comments of most politicians against it."
2024-02-18 08:00:00+00:00,Bitcoin Will Unlikely Surpass Its Near $70K ATH Before The Halving,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-will-unlikely-surpass-its-near-70k-ath-before-the-halving/,"The anticipation for the next Bitcoin (BTC) halving builds up as the estimated date of the event between April 18 and 20 draws near. With that, we are now hearing predictions here and there regarding the potential trajectory of the cryptocurrency. Some say it will surpass its all-time high (ATH) around the $70,000 line, but others doubt it will. The consensus right now seems to be inclined with the forecast that the event will likely signal another “buy the rumor, sell the news” event, so the prospect of such heights appears to be highly unlikely. However, the same cannot be said for the long-term movement of the digital asset. According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin has a strong probability of rallying on the way to the fourth halving of its ecosystem. But then again, it might not be up to the $100K as some optimists have projected nor above its ATH. This is due to the consideration that we’re already halfway through February, yet BTC remains approximately 25% away from its $68,789 peak achieved on November 10, 2021, despite its significant increase in institutional adoption. That’s even less when one has to factor in inflation adjustments or the aggregate fiat currency supply. The source said Bitcoin still needs a $350 billion increase in its market cap to get to $70K. Nevertheless, the digital asset has been performing well in the past four months as it rallied around 91% to a top of $52K on February 15th. The surge positions it among 8Market Cap’s top 10 tradable assets in the world within the past 30 days, which even surpasses Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway by over a hundred billion dollars. The chain of events leading to its push to ATH in November 2021 should be considered in this case. The primary driver of its launch during that time was the highest inflation ever recorded since 1982 at 6.8% year-over-year coupled with the 0.50% dip in traditional finance (TradFi) earnings. These led to investors seeking ways to hedge their money against the bleak economic landscape that’s still reeling from the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since Bitcoin was seen to be more accessible to gold in that period, the resulting strong demand brought about significant buying pressure on the digital currency, which eventually bumped its prices up. The asset class may be more mature now than it was in November 2021 because of the strong institutional adoption triggered by the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but the fact that the economy is far better than it was back then—despite the disappointing report from the Federal Reserve and ballooning US debt—may fail to replicate BTC’s ATH. Most analysts agree that Bitcoin will enter a long correction phase post-halving. This may last for a few months before it gradually recovers and gains a massive momentum past its ATH by the time Uptober fever hits in October or around the Santa Claus rally in December this year."
2024-02-17 03:42:00+00:00,"Peter Schiff Sides Gold Against Bitcoin ETFs, Believes Spot BTC ETFs Will Soon Plummet",https://blockzeit.com/peter-schiff-believes-spot-bitcoin-etfs-will-plummet-soon/,"Renowned Stockbroker and Financial Commentator Peter Schiff has continued his onslaught against Bitcoin while projecting Gold ($GLD) as the most valuable asset to own at this time. Schiff who is known for his anti-Bitcoin stance even upped his critique against the crypto after the Spot BTC ETF approval early this year. He believes that the spot Bitcoin ETF’s success is thriving off hype and looks forward to when “the massacre” will begin. In his tweet three days ago, Schiff said he sensed that the Bitcoin ETFs are feeding off a lot of hype and undergoing a pump-and-dump situation. He insinuated that the strategic scheduling of the recently concluded annual Exchange ETF Conference on Super Bowl Sunday was all part of the hype game to draw attention to the Bitcoin ETFs. According to Schiff, the spot Bitcoin ETF “got pumped up again at the ETF conference” and “the dump is coming.” The Bitcoin faithful on X waved off Schiff’s post as ludicrous and an attention-seeking attempt to sell Gold while taking a swipe at Bitcoin. It’s easier to connect the dots if one digs deeper into Schiff’s profile. Schiff is the Chairman of SchiffGold, a precious metals dealer with a specialty in gold and silver bullion. Perhaps his stance against Bitcoin is a deliberate attempt to hype Gold, which hasn’t improved on its all-time high for over a decade now. While Bitcoin is criticized by the likes of Schiff as highly volatile and not having organic utility like gold, the resilience of the digital gold and its unpredictability are characteristics that distinguish it from all other assets. For instance, Gold hit its 2011 high of $1,900 per ounce. It later struck a record-high of $2,135 per ounce in 2023 – which doesn’t show any significant top-up on its 2011 high. As of this writing Gold trades at $2,014, barely a 6% increase from its 2011 high. But it’s a different ball game with the Digital Gold. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 but didn’t just skedaddle into the mammoth price we see today. It started at literally $0 and endured a long resistance at $0.1 before jumping to $0.2 in 2010. Fast forward to 2011, we saw it race past $1 and arrive at a whopping high of $29.6.  Unlike Gold, Bitcoin has maintained steady growth amidst its volatility and other hurdles – amassing more value with time. It hit an all-time high of over $67,500 in 2021 and is projected to significantly exceed it moving forward. The resilience of Bitcoin despite not having a traditional reserve like other products is what baffles old-school financial analysts. A more balanced investment perspective should be to share your investments between BTC and reap from each market’s pros. As always, Schiff threw more shades at Bitcoin while on Tech Investor Anthony Pompliano’s podcast. He maintained that the early success of the Bitcoin ETFs was a “sell the news” which he supported by the fact that they fell up to 20% not long after the launch. “They’ve recovered and made new highs on the back of some renewed speculation. I think this ETF conference down in Miami that’s going on right now is probably a lot of hyping…” added Schiff. When asked if he thinks BTC will go to $100k, Schiff called it a “laser beam number” where everyone projects Bitcoin in the future. “I don’t think it’s going up there.” said a very confident Schiff. In what seemed to be a mild and jovial persuasion, Pompliano tries to get Schiff to align with Bitcoin hitting $100k. Instead of agreeing, Schiff takes a very pessimistic stance against Bitcoin. “No, I don’t think it’s going to do well. I don’t think it has any value. That’s the problem with it…”  he said. Schiff’s views on Bitcoin are a direct opposite of MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor. Saylor is a strong proponent of the Bitcoin economy and predicted that the Digital Gold will hit $1 million. Other notable figures like Robert Kiyosaki and Balaji Srinivasan former Coinbase CTO also predicted Bitcoin at $1M as of last year. "

The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $51,920 today. This represents a -0.1% price decrease in the last 24 hours and a +12.4% price increase in the past 7 days. Bitcoin market cap finally broke above the $1 trillion mark after more than 2 years. Bitcoin market cap dominance did increase very slightly, signifying that Altcoins rose with Bitcoin this week. Last week, Bitcoin price was extremely bullish rising as high as $46,000. The market was euphoric and it felt as if the top was near.BTC maintained its price action above the 40-day and 200-day moving averages and successfully broke out of the 2-month-long consolidation zone. This week the asset outperformed the markets, rising as high as $52,884 – an almost +13% increase in just 7 days.  There was a possibility that it would turn out to be a liquidity hunt, but the price action this week negates that. BTC price action is bullish but seems to have hit some resistance around $53,000 area. The long wick indicates strong rejection by the bears and the ranging pattern currently forming shows signs of weakness on the part of the bulls. If the bears should win this struggle, BTC may correct back to $50,000, and further down to $49,000 if the supports fail to hold. The 50-day moving average presents strong support at the $49,000 level.  Below this, BTC would turn bearish in the short to mid-term, falling as far down as $45,000, $43,900, and $42,400 if not contained. The current price action indicates a high chance of a Bitcoin correction. Leverage traders may want to take advantage of this with a BTC Short position, especially through the weekend.

2024-02-16 07:47:31+00:00,"Bitcoin Breaks Through the 50,000 Dollar Mark – Sustainable or Is the Crash Coming Soon?",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-the-50000-dollar-mark-sustainable-or-is-the-crash-coming-soon/,"Bitcoin, the world’s leading crypto-asset, is at a crucial turning point. After years of volatility, speculative investments and an often skeptical view from traditional financial institutions, Bitcoin has reached a significant milestone: breaking through the $50,000 mark. This event not only symbolizes a significant financial success, but also marks the beginning of a new phase in the evolution of Bitcoin. A phase that is characterized by fundamental changes in the market structure, in particular the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, which bring with them an unexpectedly high inflow of institutional capital. The current development points to an increasing maturation and institutionalization of Bitcoin, which distinguishes it from previous speculative-driven bull markets. This change is accompanied by historically low search volumes, suggesting that despite the price increases, much of the general public is not yet actively involved. This constellation offers both opportunities and challenges for the future of Bitcoin, which will be closely linked to the dynamics of traditional markets and macroeconomic developments. In the following chapters, we will examine in detail the driving forces behind Bitcoin’s recent rise, the role of ETFs, market sentiment and possible future scenarios. In doing so, we will highlight both the opportunities and risks arising from the current market situation and provide an outlook on how Bitcoin could further consolidate its position in the global financial system. Bitcoin’s recent performance, breaking through the $50,000 mark for the first time in over two years, marks a significant turning point in the history of the crypto-asset. This breakout is not only notable for its symbolic significance, but also for the underlying factors driving this rise. Unlike previous bull markets, which were often characterized by speculative investments, the current uptrend is based on more fundamental and sustainable developments. One of the main drivers of this phenomenon is the introduction and rapid adoption of Bitcoin ETFs. In recent days, these ETFs have generated an average daily spot buying pressure of 500 million dollars. This impressive figure underscores the massive demand and confidence of institutional investors in Bitcoin. Such a sustained inflow of capital into ETFs has been unprecedented and represents a marked departure from the traditionally speculative nature of previous market movements. The implications of this development are far-reaching. On the one hand, the significant inflow of capital highlights the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate investment opportunity among institutional investors. Major financial players such as Blackrock have recorded net inflows of 374 million dollars in one day alone, highlighting the appetite of these institutional investors for Bitcoin. Secondly, the increase in spot buying pressure from ETFs reflects a fundamental shift in the way Bitcoin is perceived: no longer just as a speculative asset, but as an asset class to be taken seriously. Another notable element of this uptrend is the historically low correlation between search volume for Bitcoin and its price. Despite the rise in price, search volume remains at a historic low, suggesting that the rise has gone largely unnoticed by the general public. This disconnect between public interest and price performance can be seen as an indicator that the current market is less driven by individual investors and more by institutional players. The combination of the introduction of ETFs, the significant inflow of capital and the low search volume paints a picture of a market that is maturing and increasingly characterized by experienced, institutional participants. This development signals a potential inflection point for Bitcoin, strengthening its legitimacy as an asset class while presenting new challenges and opportunities for investors. While the future path of Bitcoin remains uncertain, current developments suggest that we are at the dawn of a new era of crypto-assets that could be characterized by sustainability, institutional acceptance and potentially lower volatility. The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs has had a transformative effect on the market and the perception of Bitcoin as an asset class. These novel financial instruments have made it possible for institutional investors and traditional financial players to invest directly in Bitcoin without having to deal with the technical hurdles of buying and holding crypto assets directly. The introduction of these ETFs has led to an extraordinary increase in spot buying pressure in a very short period of time, with an average of 500 million dollars per day being invested in Bitcoin over the last three days. This development was unexpected in its scale and shows the enormous demand and confidence that institutional investors have in crypto assets. Some days saw even higher net inflows. For example, Blackrock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, reported net inflows of 374 million dollars into its Bitcoin ETF on a single day. This inflow of institutional capital within a month of the ETF’s launch exceeded all expectations and showed that institutional demand for Bitcoin is far greater than many market observers had assumed. The momentum generated by these ETFs is clearly reflected in the price development of Bitcoin and underlines the importance of institutional investment for the market. At the same time, the search volume for Bitcoin is at a historic low in relation to the rising price. This apparent discrepancy between the price of Bitcoin and public interest could indicate that the current uptrend is mainly driven by institutional investors, while individual investors and the general public are not yet equally active. This fact could prove bullish for Bitcoin as it suggests that there is significant potential for future growth as individual investors come back into the market in greater numbers, especially if Bitcoin reaches new highs. Read also: Is Bitcoin About to Cross the 55,000-Dollar Mark? The role of ETFs in the transformation of the Bitcoin market is therefore twofold: on the one hand, they have paved the way for massive institutional investment and, on the other, they have ushered in a new phase in Bitcoin’s development in which the interest and acceptance of institutional investors play a central role. The facts and figures surrounding ETFs and spot buying clearly show that we are at a turning point where Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a serious and attractive asset class capable of influencing and integrating traditional and institutional financial markets. This development sheds new light on the future of Bitcoin and points to continued growth and increasing adoption, driven by institutional investor confidence and capital. The future of Bitcoin is at an exciting inflection point, with several factors presenting both opportunities and risks to its development. A key element that characterizes the current market phase is the specific signal that occurred at the last two all-time highs and is now back in focus. This signal, which was last observed when Bitcoin reached levels well above $60,000, raises the question of whether we are setting ourselves up for another significant rise or whether a potential fall is imminent. The interpretation of this signal is crucial as it can indicate whether Bitcoin will continue to rise in the short to medium term or whether a decline will provide a new buying opportunity. An important aspect influencing the future development of Bitcoin is the role of traditional markets and their interaction with crypto assets. The recent worse-than-expected inflation data has not only affected traditional markets such as the S&P 500, but has also had a direct impact on Bitcoin. The inflation rate, which came in at 3.1% compared to the expected 2.9%, as well as the core CPI at 3.9% instead of the predicted 3.7%, have led to a negative reaction from the markets. These developments are particularly relevant as they have a direct impact on the interest rate policy of central banks and can therefore influence the attractiveness of risky assets such as Bitcoin. Read also: Bitcoin’s Path to USD 170,000, Ethereum Under Pressure and Solana’s Rise Aggregate open interest in Bitcoin futures, another indicator of market trends, is at levels last seen when the Bitcoin price was above $60,000. This high open interest, especially on the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange), which is favored by institutional investors, indicates strong institutional interest. The CME recorded open interest of over 6 billion dollars, which represents around 27% of the total market. These figures confirm the thesis that Bitcoin’s current upward trend is largely driven by institutional investment. Despite the high open interest and positive signals, there are also potential warning signs that need to be heeded. Analyzing the open interest in combination with other market data such as funding rates and the long-short ratio can provide insight into whether the market is overheated. Current data suggests that the market does not appear overheated compared to previous periods. Funding rates, which indicate how expensive it is to hold a long position, have risen, but not to a level that indicates extreme speculation. Similarly, the long-short ratio shows that there are almost as many short positions as long positions, indicating a balanced market. In summary, the future of Bitcoin will be influenced by a variety of factors, including the performance of Bitcoin ETFs, the reaction of traditional markets to macroeconomic data and the dynamics of institutional investment. While positive trends and institutional investor interest provide reasons for optimism, it is important to keep an eye on potential risks and warning signals. Interpreting market signals, analyzing open interest and understanding the interactions between Bitcoin and traditional markets are crucial to assessing the future direction of Bitcoin. The coming months will show whether Bitcoin can continue its growth and what role institutional investors and macroeconomic factors will play in this. Bitcoin’s recent performance, marked by the breakthrough of the $50,000 mark, signals a significant turning point in the history of crypto assets. The rise is being driven by fundamental changes in the market, in particular the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, which are enabling a massive inflow of institutional capital. This clearly distinguishes the current bull market from previous, speculative-driven phases and points to a maturing of the market. The role of ETFs is central to this, as they make it easier for institutional investors to enter the market and thus contribute to a sustainable price trend. The notable increase in spot buying pressure from ETFs, coupled with historically low search volumes, indicates that the market is currently driven mainly by institutional investors. This development harbors both opportunities and risks. On the one hand, the broad acceptance of Bitcoin by institutional investors could lead to further growth. On the other hand, an overheating of the market, should it occur, could lead to abrupt corrections. Future developments depend heavily on the interaction between Bitcoin and traditional markets, especially in the context of macroeconomic data such as inflation rates and interest rate policy. Aggregate open interest and institutional investment dynamics will be important indicators for the short to medium term market direction. Analyzing open interest, funding rates and the long-short ratio will provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. Overall, Bitcoin is on the cusp of a new era characterized by institutional acceptance, increasing regulation and integration into traditional financial markets. While the road ahead holds challenges, particularly in terms of market volatility and regulatory uncertainty, current developments offer reasons for optimism. The growing institutionalization of Bitcoin could lead to a more stable and sustainable price trend, making the crypto-asset an increasingly integral part of the global financial system. The next few months will be crucial to observe how these trends unfold and what new opportunities and challenges they bring for Bitcoin and the crypto market as a whole."
2024-02-15 05:50:49+00:00,"BTC Surpasses $52K, Is It Too Late To Buy Bitcoin?",https://blockzeit.com/btc-surpasses-52k-is-it-too-late-to-buy-bitcoin/,"It all happened so fast, from the eve of the Chinese New Year and the aftermath of the Super Bowl, Bitcoin (BTC) continued its momentum as it went to a new multi-year high of $52K not seen since December 2021. With no immediate signs of slowing down, some expect the digital asset to be on its way to its all-time high (ATH) near $70K. Is it too late for you to buy Bitcoin? Although BTC has long sailed from its one-month low of $38K and it’s now hovering above the $52K mark, it’s not yet too late to stack on Bitcoin. This is due to major things happening all at once that are correlated to the movement of BTC’s prices. One of the primary catalysts for BTC’s continuous rise this month is the anticipation of the halving. The cyclical event is set to reduce Bitcoin mining reward per block by 50%, which will take its current 6.25 BTC per block reward to 3.125 BTC. Now on its fourth epoch, this event has always pushed the crypto asset’s prices to new heights. With the rising institutional demand for the crypto asset, the tightening supply will likely take the bulls to new heights. The current trend shows that a majority of Bitcoin whales are no longer selling and just sitting out on their hoard, or gradually accumulating more, with hopes that prices are about to blow off the roof. This takes us back to the recent data presented by Pomp Investments Founder Anthony Pompliano, which indicated that around 80% of Bitcoin’s supply hadn’t moved in the past six months and there are only approximately $200 billion worth of tradable BTC in circulation now. Out of these numbers, he estimated that 5% are already being held by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers in the US in their first month of operations. Let’s not even get to the part that major markets, namely the US and China are on the verge of a recession. Analysts agree that both superpowers are on the brink of an economic downturn due to their faulty monetary and fiscal policies coupled with their diplomatic tensions. The US of A is in a particularly tough spot right now because of its rising debt which already amounts to more than $34 trillion. This is thanks to its incessant “military aid,” especially in Ukraine and Israel, domestic tensions, rising costs of goods and services, and other factors. Meanwhile, China is in the same predicament because of its souring relationship with the West, particularly in its stance over Taiwan and the South China Sea, resulting in its first-ever foreign investment deficit. Bitcoin is now considered the “hardest asset” out there due to some traits it shares with gold, but with the addition of its finite supply of 21 million BTC. Thus, it presents itself as a sound hedge against economic and geopolitical uncertainties."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2024-02-14 15:08:19+00:00,Bitcoin Crosses $51K And Reclaims $1 Trillion Market Cap,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-crosses-51k-and-reclaims-1-trillion-market-cap/,"Only two days after crossing the $50K mark, Bitcoin (BTC) continues its climb as it just conquered the $51K range. The price not seen since the end of 2021 now puts the market cap of the digital asset at $1 trillion. Bitcoin just achieved new heights today at around 9:00 AM UTC as it leaped into the $51K realm. As of this writing at around 3:00 PM UTC, the largest crypto by market cap is now trading at the $51,900 line and is displaying nearly 7% gain on the 24-hour chart. The soaring numbers took the total market value of the coin’s circulating supply of more than 19 million BTC to $1.018 trillion. Within the same span, it saw a 9% dip in trading volume as $39.21 billion worth of BTC moved between wallets and exchanges. Along the way, prices moved between a low of $48,406 and a high of $51,909. The development now narrows down the gap between the prevailing price of Bitcoin from its all-time high (ATH) by less than 25%. This once again refuels the narrative that the digital asset may finally be on its way toward surpassing its previously recorded peak this 2024. The main narrative driving Bitcoin right now is its impending halving, which is estimated to happen this coming April 18. The cyclical phenomenon occurring every four years in the BTC ecosystem constantly reduces rewards per block mined by 50%. Another factor influencing the rally is the growing retail and institutional adoption of Bitcoin through the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. In their first 30 days of trading alone, both BlackRock and Fidelity were able to log a combined $3 billion in assets under management (AUM) in their respective Bitcoin ETFs. As of today’s pre-market, both haven’t shown any sign of slowing down as their ETFs just rose 4.6% and 4.9%, respectively. So far, BlackRock has reported $4.6 billion in inflows since February 11 while Fidelity trailed at $3.3 billion inflows. Recently, Pomp Investments Founder Anthony Pompliano claimed that the massive demand created by spot Bitcoin ETFs is now starting to overwhelm the circulating supply of BTC. “The inflows from these funds are doing $500 million a day of net inflows, but there’s only 900 Bitcoin coming into the daily incoming supply,” he explained earlier. What’s more, the data he gathered indicated that almost 80% of all Bitcoin in circulation hadn’t moved in the past six months, which further tightens the supply. From those numbers, approximately 5% have already been siphoned by spot Bitcoin ETFs in just a month since their regulatory approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)."
2024-02-13 14:04:34+00:00,Robert Kiyosaki Warns 70% S&P Crash And Recommends Investing In Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-70-sp-crash-and-recommends-investing-in-bitcoin/,"Renowned author and investor Robert Kiyosaki just issued a stern warning about an incoming market catastrophe he referred to as the “biggest crash in history.” In his post on X (formerly Twitter), he cautioned investors to be vigilant for the looming 70% collapse of the S&P. He advised investing in hard assets and Bitcoin as protection against the impending shakeup. In a recent post on X, the famous author of the best-selling book “Rich Dad Poor Dad” claimed that the only way for people to avert exposure to the potential fall of the S&P 500 is to allocate their investments in hard assets. He also revealed that the only reason why financial advisers are not recommending them is due to the hefty commissions they generate from traditional investments. Finally a few Financial Planners are recommending investing in Gold, Silver, Bitcoin. Q: Why have financial planners not recommended investing in hard assets earlier? A: $. Money Baby !!! Commissions!!! Gold has beaten the S&P for decades. The S&P is about to crash by 70%.… For context, hard assets are fixed assets that aid in the production of goods and services. They are tangible or physical in nature with intrinsic value and non-perishable traits. In the past, Kiyosaki’s strategy involved hedging his wealth via real estate, commodities, silver, and gold. However, as Bitcoin went mainstream, he also embraced the digital asset in his portfolio. It’s not clear how much BTC Kiyosaki owns, but he claimed he had been saving and investing in it via social media last month. He referred to it as a “protection against the theft of our wealth via money” through the imposition of taxes, inflation, and stock price manipulation. Kiyosaki said that the impending catastrophe has already been forecasted in his book “Rick Dad’s Prophecy” published a decade ago. Some people, however, questioned the accuracy of Kiyosaki’s predictions because he has been telling people the same thing for more than a decade. Nick Maggiulli, the author of the book “Just Keep Buying,” even mapped out the market crash projections Kiyosaki made in more than a decade through a chart to display how he got it wrong most of the time. Others also criticized the lack of technical analysis supporting the investor’s claims. Meanwhile, one of them defended why advisers may be skipping on hard assets, including Bitcoin. According to a comment, the primary reason why they might not be recommending them is due to their lack of familiarity with the assets in question. It could also be because they are simply tailoring their recommendations based on their clients’ preferences and existing regulatory guidelines. The arrival and adoption of Bitcoin have redefined the concept of hard assets over the years. In fact, BTC has a lot of features that position it as the hardest asset out there according to Medium. Although the digital asset shares many features present in gold, except tangibility, it stands out for its known finite supply of only 21 million BTC. Looking at its short-term movements, Bitcoin is evidently a volatile asset. However, zooming out its long-term performance reveals its true worth as a hedge that surpasses gold. Thanks to its limited supply and evolving mining difficulty every halving, BTC has steadily and gradually shown price appreciation amid its cyclical short-term fluctuations. It went from a time when 10,000 BTC could only buy two family-sized pizzas in 2010 up to an all-time high of nearly $70,000 in 2021. Currently, it’s trading at the $50,000 mark."
2024-02-13 09:53:34+00:00,Bitcoin Surges Past $50k As SEC Enhances Market Security Measures,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-surges-past-50k-as-sec-enhances-market-security-measures/,"Monday was a big day for the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin breaking the $50,000 barrier. The Bitcoin pice overcame the $48,500 resistance level, reaching heights last seen in November 2021. The climb in Bitcoin’s value can be attributed to the significant ETF inflow recorded last week, totaling approximately $1.1 billion. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event, due in two months, is also stirring investor anticipation, fueling expectations for the market’s future.  On Monday, Bitcoin saw a 3.2% rise in its value, trading above $47,500. Market bulls pushed the price further, reaching a two-year high of $50,150. This surge was largely driven by the “Fear of Missing Out” (FOMO) phenomenon, with market analysts highlighting how FOMO has captivated investors’ interest. Moreover, the anticipated halving in April, which will halve the mining rate of new Bitcoins, thereby creating a scarcity, has amplified investors’ expectations. Such scarcity is instrumental in driving Bitcoin’s price upward in the market. Additionally, the market benefited from a decline in Grayscale outflows. At the time of this report, Bitcoin was trading at $49,973, marking a 3.62% increase over 24 hours and elevating the cryptocurrency market cap to $1.87 trillion. In the fast-evolving cryptocurrency market, security has become paramount. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is at the forefront of ensuring stringent security measures are in place. With the expansion of the market, the threat from scammers and hackers has also escalated. Following the hacking incident of the SEC’s Twitter (X) account, cybersecurity has taken center stage within the agency. “We take cybersecurity extremely seriously,” stated Gary Gensler during a Financial Service Committee meeting last week, emphasizing the SEC’s commitment to cybersecurity. He also highlighted the importance of individual vigilance against internet scammers and hackers, who are responsible for stealing over $2 billion annually. The year 2022 saw record-breaking hacks and thefts in the sector, with more than $5 billion in assets stolen, underscoring the critical need for enhanced security measures."
2024-02-13 07:03:02+00:00,All-Time High For Bitcoin Is On The Horizon Says Pomp Investments Founder,https://blockzeit.com/all-time-high-for-bitcoin-is-on-the-horizon-says-pomp-investments-founder/,"Bitcoin (BTC) breached the $50K mark on Monday. The price not seen since December 2021 is now fueling renewed optimism in the future trajectory of the digital asset. For Pomp Investments founder Anthony Pompliano, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap could very well be on its way to reclaiming its past glory in November 2021 when it went to an all-time high of almost $70K. After enduring much lashing from the powerhouses in Wall Street over the years, Bitcoin has finally won the favor of a lot of key players in the traditional finance (TradFi) sector. Now, it has become their favorite asset said Pompliano. “Wall Street doesn’t just like Bitcoin. They love Bitcoin,” the Pomp Investments founder stated in an interview with CNBC. The investor illustrated his point by looking at the historic achievements of BlackRock and Fidelity in their respective spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) over their first 30 days of trading. During this span, the combined assets under management (AUM) of the financial heavyweights crossed the $3 billion threshold, which Pompliano noted was something never experienced before by more than 5,500 ETF launches throughout history. It’s worth also noting that although the Bitwise and Ark Invest spot Bitcoin ETFs are far from the feat achieved by the industry leaders, their combined performance has displayed almost $1 billion inflows. The demand driven by spot Bitcoin ETFs is now overwhelming the Bitcoin supply. According to Pompliano, the present demand is already outpacing the daily production of BTC by 12.5 times. He attributed this scenario as the primer for the explosion of Bitcoin prices, and this could only be the beginning. “The inflows from these funds are doing $500 million a day of net inflows, but there’s only 900 bitcoin coming into the daily incoming supply,” Pompliano explained. What’s more, the investor revealed that almost 80% of all Bitcoin in circulation had not moved in the past six months. This goes on to show that many are refusing to sell their BTC or are just accumulating more of the supply. Given this, he estimated that there’s currently only $200 billion worth of tradable BTC, and the spot Bitcoin ETFs have already sucked up 5% of these in just a month. Pompliano added that the incessant money printing of central banks combined with the debasement of fiat currencies are further turning people into Bitcoin as they seek ways to hedge their wealth against inflation. Moreover, there’s the having event looming that will tighten the BTC supply by half. “If this continues, that we have 12.5 times more demand… this thing’s going back to its all-time high. It’s pretty much guaranteed,” Pompliano forecasted."
2024-02-13 04:07:13+00:00,MicroStrategy Declares Itself As Bitcoin Development Company,https://blockzeit.com/microstrategy-declares-itself-as-bitcoin-development-company/,"MicroStrategy now wants to be referred to as a “Bitcoin (BTC) development company.” This was confirmed by its Executive Chair, Michael Saylor, in a recent interview following Bitcoin’s resurgence to the $50,000 mark a couple of hours ago. “It makes sense for us to call ourselves as Bitcoin development company in the same way you should see a real estate development company or a petroleum development company,” Saylor just told CNBC. Saylor’s statement reaffirms the proclamation he made during his company’s Q4 earnings call on Friday. The exec highlighted their dedication to the continuous development of the Bitcoin network alongside their commitment to financial markets, advocacy, and innovation. MicroStrategy’s press release also emphasized the dual-core strategy of the firm which reflects its “Intelligence Everywhere” mantra. It involves acquiring and holding Bitcoin due to its dependability as a store of value while growing its enterprise software business to drive innovation. The company co-founded by Saylor now holds 190,000 Bitcoin after their latest acquisition in January. The digital assets were purchased at an average of $31,224 per BTC for a total of $5.93 billion. As of 3:00 AM UTC, despite Bitcoin tumbling back to the $49,000 range from a $50,000 high in the 24-hour charts, MicroStrategy has already gained an unrealized profit of $3.38 billion from its Bitcoin holdings. On a broader scale, MicroStrategy’s two-pronged approach in both emerging and traditional markets appeared to have paid off as it outperformed Bitcoin and other big tech stocks like Microsoft and Google. With the advent of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, Saylor said Bitcoin is now the world’s most popular investment asset. He added that it’s novel, digital, global, and unique in the sense that it’s uncorrelated to traditional risk assets. The MicroStrategy Chair further explained that BTC does not come with risk exposure to any given country, currency, company, quarterly result, product cycle, competitor, weather, war, employee base, or supply chain. Given these, it presents a “natural addition” to every investor’s portfolio. Saylor foresees a strong demand and surge of capital for Bitcoin going forward as it has already encroached on the ETFs market, which has resulted in 10 times more demand for BTC. Notably, the exec hadn’t even touched on the topic of Bitcoin halving in the discussion, which should be another catalyst for a surge in demand for the crypto asset. As of this writing, Bitcoin has retracted to $49,900 after it traded between a low of $47,700 and a high of $50,300 in the 24-hour chart. This primes its market cap to $979.37 billion while trading volume for the asset soared to 57% as $33.82 billion worth of BTC moved between wallets and exchanges."
2024-02-12 17:07:51+00:00,Just Now: Bitcoin Breaches The $50K Mark,https://blockzeit.com/just-now-bitcoin-breaches-the-50k-mark/,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues to build momentum since crossing the $45,000 range last Friday before the Chinese New Year kicked off. At around 5:00 PM UTC today, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap just breached the $50,000 mark. Could this be a sign that the trading for the halving has already started? Last month, 10x Research’s Head of Research Markus Thielen warned that BTC’s trajectory could further dip throughout the “sell the news” affair that occurred following the approval of the first 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He predicted how the digital asset could find dynamic support at the $38,000 level based on the RSI divergence indicator. In consolation, the analyst gave a bold forecast that it could jump up once the trading for the halving begins just in time for the Super Bowl. Interestingly, Bitcoin lost the $40,000 support and established a new one at the range he projected. From then on, it gradually recovered its stride upwards, and after the Kansas City Chiefs successfully defended their championship against the San Francisco 49ers, the digital currency suddenly shot up to $50,000. Could this be a sign of a wild ride upwards until the halving? Others like DecenTrader, however, suggest that the actual trading for the Bitcoin halving will not start until six weeks before the pivotal event or around the second week of March. It expects a bumpy ride along the way, which could see BTC tanking to another low at $37,000 prior to reclaiming the $49,000. The analytics firm further cautions of another “sell the news event” taking place similar to the one that happened in the immediate aftermath of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in the US. This will be the time when the true diamond hands’ mettle will be tested as the post-halving is foreseen to trigger a long consolidation phase until the fourth quarter of 2024 between the heavily hyped Uptober in October or a Santa Claus rally in December. At the end of the ordeal, HODLers could be rewarded to an all-new all-time high, which the Motley Fool bullishly calls at $100,000. We only have 64 days remaining until the fourth epoch of the BTC halving, which will cut Bitcoin mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. With only around 9,800 blocks remaining until the 840,000th block target, the much-anticipated phenomenon is expected to trigger by April 18, 2024."
2024-02-12 13:36:52+00:00,US President Joe Biden Posts “Dark Brandon” Picture Linked To Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/us-president-joe-biden-posts-dark-brandon-picture-linked-to-bitcoin/,"Joe Biden, or whoever manages his social media account on X (formerly Twitter), just posted a picture of the sitting US President with laser eyes at the conclusion of the Super Bowl LVIII. This got the attention of the cryptocurrency community because of how it mirrored some memes related to Bitcoin (BTC). Around eight hours ago (as of 12:00 PM UTC) after the Kansas City Chiefs’ victory against the San Francisco 49ers, the X handle of Biden posted a picture of himself on a black background, wearing a white suit, and with red laser eyes. It came with the caption, “Just like we drew it up.” Just like we drew it up. pic.twitter.com/9NBvc5nVZE Upon closer examination of its other posts, we found out that the same photo was linked to the TikTok post his social media account reposted earlier from the Biden-Harris HQ X handle. This showed the US President responding to a rapid Q&A session about the Super Bowl LVIII. The same image occurred at the time when he answered the question, “Deviously plotting to rig the season so the Chiefs would make the Super Bowl or the Chiefs just being a good football team?” Wherein he replied, “I’d get in trouble if I told you.” Hey by the way, we just joined TikTokFollow us: https://t.co/KbtdOh2O4a pic.twitter.com/vDeXUzhb9W The Biden with laser eyes post immediately caught the radar of entrepreneur and Bitcoin investor Lark Davis to which he commented, “Joe did you just buy Bitcoin?” Followed up by “Also W intern.” Joe did you just buy #Bitcoin?Also W intern. Another popular crypto personality, the pseudonymous Shibetoshi Nakamoto, jokingly said, “OK intern you are promoted.” ok intern you are promoted Apparently, the post was just unintentionally linked to Bitcoin and not an endorsement of the digital asset itself. This is given the never-ending scrutiny the Biden administration is imposing on cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin mining up to the present. From the looks of it, the social media posting was a way of embracing the “Dark Brandon” meme to make the US President appear cool and edgy despite talks of his waning physical and mental health. It was meant to reinforce the joke in the abovementioned TikTok post that they had a hand in the Chiefs’ victory to win the endorsement of Travis Kelce’s girlfriend, Taylor Swift, for the coming US Presidential election. Others, however, see it as a strategic post to appeal to the crypto masses. Capping up the 104th season of the NFL saw the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs retain their championship against the San Francisco 49ers with a score of 25-24 after going to an overtime. It’s interesting to note that Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey was also spotted in the audience seated next to power couple Jay-Z and Beyonce while sporting a “Satoshi” T-shirt. This was likely a shoutout to the ongoing trial in the UK disputing Craig Wright’s claim that he was the creator of Bitcoin, which Dorsey and other major players in the crypto industry initiated back in 2021."
2024-02-12 10:00:00+00:00,Does Bill Gates Own Bitcoin Or Any Other Cryptocurrency?,https://blockzeit.com/does-bill-gates-own-bitcoin-or-any-other-cryptocurrency/,"Microsoft co-founder and former CEO Bill Gates is a visionary who made a major contribution to the advancement of modern computers. He was once the richest man in the world, thanks to the success of his inventions and his company’s creations. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies are presently making huge strides in changing the financial technology (FinTech) world. Given his love for innovations, we couldn’t help but wonder, “Does Bill Gates own Bitcoin or altcoins?” As of 2023, he didn’t have any, and he probably never will. Well, it seems like the 68-year-old entrepreneur and climate activist has already shed his adventurous ways when it comes to digital innovations. Besides his disdain for anything related to Apple — even though he stole Apple’s Macintosh’s concept to create the Windows out of it, he hadn’t been shy of showing that he wasn’t a fan of Bitcoin or anything related to crypto. In fact, he seemed to have never missed an opportunity to diss them at any chance he could get. So, if you don’t want to get Grandpa Gates all grumpy all of a sudden, be sure to skip the topic of anything related to iPhones and cryptos. One of the famous lines of Gates against cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) was his claim that they are “100% based on greater fool theory.” For context, this concept first discussed by Professor Burton Malkiel states that one can still earn even from overvalued assets or securities because another (the greater fool) will likely purchase them at a higher price. This cycle goes on until the market eventually runs out of “fools,” which forces a major sell-off or dipping prices. The former Microsoft CEO even joked how “expensive digital images of monkeys” would “improve the world immensely.” In this case, he was undoubtedly taking a shot at the intrinsic value of the much-hyped cartoonish ape NFT collection released by Bored Ape Yacht back in 2021, which was all the buzz up to April 2022 before losing 88% of their value in 2023. “I’m used to asset classes … like a farm where they have output, or like a company where they make products,” said the man behind the success of Windows in a past CNBC interview. “I’m not involved in that,” Gates noted regarding crypto. “I’m not long or short any of those things.” Another slating remark of Gates on Bitcoin that recently resurfaced was his interview with Bloomberg where he shared his thoughts on the digital asset. In 2021, the former Microsoft boss warned people about the risks associated with BTC due to its price volatility. He cautioned people who were barely making a living with their finances to steer away from it. “Elon has tons of money, and he’s very sophisticated, so I don’t worry that his Bitcoin will randomly go up or down,” Gates pointed out. “If you have less money than Elon, you should probably watch out.” Ironically, his cautionary comment came in the same year when Bitcoin shot up to an all-time high of $69,789.49 alongside other cryptocurrencies. Given Gates’ previous scathing pronouncements on BTC and its fellow cryptos, it’s unlikely that he holds any of them to this year. Add the fact that Bitcoin has always been criticized for its high energy use, which always had the eyes of tree-huggers like Gates rolling."
2024-02-12 08:00:00+00:00,How Much Bitcoin Does The Richest Man In 2024 Own?,https://blockzeit.com/how-much-bitcoin-does-the-richest-man-in-2024-own/,"Since its inception, Bitcoin (BTC) has always been touted as the best hedge of wealth akin to gold. Over time, this has gradually been realized as it time and again survived various market crashes even without the benefit of a government bailout. Now, this makes us wonder if the richest man alive in the world shares the same faith in the digital asset as we do. According to the latest tally of Forbes in January, Elon Musk is now the world’s wealthiest person. Besides his strong social media presence on the X platform, he is best known for his role as CEO of Tesla and other X group of companies. His key sources of cash flow come from his 23% stake in Tesla, and it is estimated that around two-thirds of his wealth is anchored to the famous electric vehicle (EV) brand. The billionaire entrepreneur made waves when he decided to purchase Twitter (rebranded as X in 2023) to the tune of $44 billion to give people a platform to exercise their free speech. His long-term goal is the transformation of X into an “everything app” similar to China’s WeChat, which will integrate digital payments compatible with cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum alongside a slew of other features like TV, dating, job recruitment, and more. Musk has an estimated net worth of $210.2 billion, which is only around $2 billion ahead of the second person on the list, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton founder, CEO, and Chair Bernard Arnault. Back in 2019, Musk admitted via Twitter that he only owned but a fraction of a BTC. He confessed, “I literally own zero cryptocurrency, apart from 0.25 BTC that a friend sent me many years ago.” During that time, that unit is worth $2,500 and worth nearly five times by now. Fast-forward to February 2021, Tesla, helmed by Musk, made a staggering purchase of 43,000 BTC for around $1.5 billion. An announcement made by the CEO also said his company will be taking Bitcoin as payment. It wouldn’t be long until they backtracked and sold their holdings, leaving only 9,720 BTC in their coffers. To date, Musk’s automotive brand still holds those Bitcoin, which should be around $466.56 million at the current $48K per BTC rate. Meanwhile, if they held on to their 43,000 BTC, it would have gained $500 million today. Had they waited until the crypto topped at $68K during that year, it would have almost doubled their investment. The confirmation that the world’s richest man alive hedges his or his businesses’ wealth on Bitcoin feeds the narrative that the cryptocurrency is indeed a potential safeguard against economic and geopolitical uncertainties. But then again, a closer examination shows that Elon Musk only has a chump change of his riches in the digital asset, which makes us question whether or not he is only using it as a plaything instead of going all-in. This only shows that he still exercises caution with regard to BTC and diversification of assets combined with due diligence is still the best play going forward."
2024-02-12 06:00:00+00:00,Is Bitcoin Heading To The $100K Territory?,https://blockzeit.com/is-bitcoin-heading-to-the-100k-territory/,"Gone were the days when one Bitcoin (BTC) wasn’t even enough to buy a full-sized pizza and $10K per coin was such a stratospheric prospect. Now, the argument is whether or not it could breach a new all-time high of $100K. Setting aside the forecasts of Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood and venture capitalist Tim Draper, here’s another take from The Motley Fool regarding the subject. Addressing the elephant in the room, The Motley Fool starts by pointing out that the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US didn’t exactly pan out as many optimistic analysts and investors had expected. So far, it failed to elevate the digital asset they are based on to new heights. Right now, it is even struggling to tap the $50K line. According to its analyst, it appeared that what spot Bitcoin ETFs did was only move Bitcoin investors away from the crypto asset to another financial instrument (the ETF). It was observed that their level of Bitcoin exposure merely remained the same, too. As they say, “Past performance is no guarantee of future performance.” However, the stock investing and market research firm claimed that although it is risky to assume that Bitcoin will 100% moon on the next halving, it only makes sense to assume that the resulting scarcity of BTC following the event coupled with its deflationary effect could potentially trigger a renewed interest to the world’s most dominant crypto by market cap. Along the way, this could push the digital asset to rally. But then again, while the possibility of a $100K top is not impossible, the road there could be bumpy. Previously, analysts warned of a “sell the news” scenario occurring in the immediate aftermath of the halving. This should be similar to what took place right after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlit the much-anticipated spot Bitcoin ETFs. BTC could tank as low as $33K at this point, which should truly test every HODLer’s resolve. Next, it could replicate its $49K peak last month before consolidation and trading sideways for a time. With that, it may take 12 to 18 months until the charge of the bulls will really be felt. Nevertheless, the source remains confident that Bitcoin breaching the $100K boundary by the end of the current year is likely. So, just how confident is the investment adviser over Bitcoin? Based on its disclosure, 112 of its employees and contractors collectively referred to as “Fools” hold long positions in the crypto asset. In fact, it ranks number 25 in the Fools’ preferred stocks. The top three companies where The Motley Fool and its associates have the most long positions include Apple held by 276 Fools, Amazon staked by 246 Fools, and Walt Disney wagered on by 243 Fools. While these bits of information are truly reassuring, due diligence is recommended when deciding your financial future. Thus, don’t take this report as investment advice on our part but merely a tool to supplement your research."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now.

2024-02-12 04:00:00+00:00,Is The Year Of The Wood Dragon An Opportune Time To Invest In Bitcoin?,https://blockzeit.com/is-the-year-of-the-wood-dragon-an-opportune-time-to-invest-in-bitcoin/,"Since losing momentum following the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, BTC has been moving lazily sideways with a temporary dip in the $38K area over the past month. However, it suddenly breached the $44K line on the way to the weekend until eventually settling at the $48K range. Interestingly, this more than 12% surge in the weekly chart of the digital asset coincided with the Chinese New Year festivities. With the arrival of the Wood Dragon, could this be the ideal time to invest in Bitcoin? The Chinese astrology revolves around 12 animals and five elements. It is celebrated based on the cycles of the Chinese lunar calendar, which explains why it changes dates from time to time in the standard Gregorian calendar. The previous year was the time of the Water Rabbit and last February 10 marked the arrival of the Wood Dragon. What’s so remarkable about the new cycle is that it’s the only one represented by a mythical creature in the Chinese zodiac. The rest are based on animals that we normally encounter. Being a special character compared to its counterparts and being on top of the food chain, the Chinese dragon represents confidence, intelligence, and enthusiasm. This is a major departure from the rabbit’s quiet, elegant, kind, and responsible nature. Enchanted with the element of wood, the year promises a period of growth, vitality, and prospering wisdom according to renowned Chinese medicine practitioner Tsao-Lin Moy in an interview with the New York Post. “Dragons are Yang in nature; enigmatic, intelligent, spiritual, and wise,” Moy said. “The Wood Dragon is the energy of spring, of reaching toward the light while deepening roots into the soil.” “Pay attention to balancing the Yang energy of the Dragon with the Yin energy of the Earth, so you can grow and expand to greater heights in your career and personal life,” she added. “Remember, deep roots support growth and expansion.” Meanwhile, Chinese metaphysics consultant Vicky Iskandar predicts that many game-breaking opportunities lie in the turn of the new cycle. She noted in her blog, “The year one encounters the animal sign of their birth is usually a life-changing one, and it often coincides with Jupiter’s return in one’s natal chart.” Similar to the Chinese lunar calendar, Bitcoin also undergoes a cycle until it reaches its cap of 21 million BTC. The arrival of the Wood Dragon is just in time for the pivotal moment in the Bitcoin ecosystem, the halving. The fourth halving happening in April increases Bitcoin mining difficulty by reducing its rewards by 50%. Currently, the reward for each block mined in the Bitcoin blockchain stands at 6.25 BTC. This will be reduced to 3.125 BTC post-halving. With the growing institutional demand for Bitcoin, primed by the arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the fourth halving cycle is expected to trigger a heightened demand for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Historically, each halving has displayed all-new heights for BTC values with the last cycle topping near the $69K mark. With the mystical benefits ushered in by the Wooden Dragon and the creature’s confidence and cleverness in exploring uncharted places, Bitcoin could very well mimic the same traits as some analysts have predicted that the next halving could be the catalyst for the crypto asset’s eventual climb to $100K or more. It could likely be a truly life-changing moment for people who religiously HODL the asset with their diamond hands. Overall, the predictions for the year of the Wood Dragon are truly enticing, especially when applied to investing in Bitcoin, but do remember that they are not based on any scientific or systematic study. As shown here, most involve sweeping statements and general descriptions that could be linked to just about anything. While we are not dismissing the mystic nature of Chinese astrology, it’s always prudent to anchor your financial decisions on research based on tested and proven strategies. And when in doubt, be sure to seek the advice of expert financial advisers."
2024-02-11 07:45:26+00:00,How Will The Massive Offloading Of GBTC By Genesis Impact Bitcoin?,https://blockzeit.com/how-will-the-massive-offloading-of-gbtc-by-genesis-impact-bitcoin/,"Another massive selling event of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is looming after the latest updates on the case involving Genesis Global and Gemini Trust. With 31.2 million shares at stake worth over $1.3 billion, how will this potentially impact the market? According to the Wall Street Journal, crypto lender Genesis just won the judge’s favor in its conflict against Gemini regarding the ownership of 31.2 million shares of GBTC, which should help some of its creditors reclaim some of their funds. However, the finality of the matter is still subject to the resolution of some pending motions. Genesis filed for bankruptcy in January last year after it took a major hit from the collapse of Three Arrows Capital and FTX in November 2022. Following this, the Winklevoss-owned firm, Gemini, sued its former partner. The point of contention lay over the GBTC ownership, claiming that the contested shares were pledged as collateral on loans to Genesis from customers under Gemini’s Earn investment program. GBTC was subsequently converted into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval last month. Based on Friday’s closing at NYSE Arca, the stake has more than doubled its value to $1.3 billion since Genesis’ bankruptcy filing as GBTC traded at $42.48 per share. According to Blockworks, the eventual granting of control over its GBTC shares would also enable Genesis to offload its Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and Ethereum Classic Trust (ETCG) both issued by Grayscale. Again, it could result in a gush of outflows in billions of dollars, which many fear may drag down Bitcoin and the prices of other cryptocurrencies, similar to the affair that took place in the aftermath of the SEC’s nod. Should the outflows begin soon, the selling pressure could hypothetically offset the gains of Bitcoin over the weekend, which saw it soar between $45K on Friday and $48K this Sunday. However, K33 Research Senior Analyst Vetle Lunde believes it won’t disturb the market based on his statement to DLNews. Lunde clarified that the judge’s verdict only allows GBTC to be returned to customers in cash and not in Bitcoin while adding, “But per the motion, the aim is to use proceeds from sales [or] redemptions, or cash on hand in anticipation of proceeds, to purchase Bitcoin.” “The net effect should be balanced net buying and selling,” the analyst went on. This means the next dump of GBTC will hardly be felt at all. What’s more, the growing inflows in spot Bitcoin ETFs will likely quell the weight of the sell-out. But then again, he warned, “Even if approved, less transparent spot purchases compared to daily ETF flow updates may suffice to spook the market into de-risk mode.” Bitcoin saw a climb in prices going to the weekend as it breached $45K on Friday to today’s $48,300 as of 7:30 AM (UTC). The pump resulted in more than 2% increase in the price of the coin to take its market cap up to $948 billion."
2024-02-09 10:07:04+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Zooms Past $45,000 As MicroStrategy Dips Feet In Bitcoin Blockchain Development",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-zooms-past-45000-as-microstrategy-dips-feet-in-bitcoin-blockchain-development/,"Bitcoin price experienced a three-day pump that broke above $45,000 and hit a high of $45,554 on Thursday, February 8, 2024. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $46,216 today. This represents a +3.8% price increase in the last 24 hours and a +7.3% price decrease in the past 7 days. Last week Bitcoin price experienced a significant rise of 7.9% from a low of $38,900 and touched a high of $43,800. Bitcoin broke above the 50-day moving average and remained inside the ranging zone for some days. The 50-day moving average later acted as a support from which BTC bounced and continued the upward trajectory. Over the past two days, Bitcoin rallied 6.91% and broke out of the consolidation zone.  The Bitcoin engine is hot and BTC bulls are laser-focused on hitting the previous YTD high of 49,048. But Bitcoin may continue. Weekly pivot points show that Bitcoin can hit $47,338, $49,836, and $53,913 in this run. The possibility of this rally turning into yet another liquidity high event is high as there have been two other such cases in the recent past.  Hence, bulls might want to be careful on this rally. On the other hand, if smart money is done hunting for liquidity, then they might let BTC run higher. The two-month-long consolidation zone provided enough time for market makers to manipulate market prices and add liquidity to their coffers. What comes next is a pump that may see Bitcoin touch $52,000 before a Black Swan even causes the markets to crash. I still maintain my prior prediction of a $33,000 BTC by halving week and a $57,000 BTC by June 2024.

2024-02-09 07:30:44+00:00,How The Halving Will Force A More Sustainable Bitcoin Mining,https://blockzeit.com/halving-sustainable-bitcoin-mining/,"With the way Bitcoin (BTC) mining is painted by most politicians and other critics, it’s really hard to equate it with environmental sustainability. While it’s true that it has heavily relied on archaic energy sources in the past few years, the technological leaps of the present and the halving could change the way the operation is implemented and how we see it. This article, thus, tries to explore how the halving will mold Bitcoin mining into an environmentally sustainable effort going forward. BTC’s proof-of-work (PoW) framework, which uses a competitive validation method to verify transactions and generate new blocks to the blockchain, is undeniably an energy-intensive endeavor. Gone were the days when homebrewed rigs were enough for Bitcoin mining. Sure, they can still be used to this day. However, as rewards are halved every four years, this could prove to be an impractical venture for small players because they will now have to contend with large-scale miners packing expensive Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware specially tailored for such purpose. Therefore, they’re better off using their home-made devices for altcoins with higher yields. The real winners in every Bitcoin halving, aside from investors, are large-scale cryptocurrency mining operators. But then again, these big-time players will have to continuously explore ways to be more resourceful to ensure profits as well as to comply with stringent environmental regulations. This is where the environmental benefits come in. Based on the latest data from the University of Cambridge Judge Business School in 2024, Bitcoin mining uses up to 176.06 TWh annually. At face value, these are overwhelming numbers, but they still dwarf in comparison to the global industrial production figures of paper and pulp at 586 TWh, chemicals at 1,349 TWh, iron and steel at 1233 TWh, cement at 384 TWh, data centers at 200 TWh, and data networks at 250 TWh. It is also but a fraction of the 2,199 TWh required in air conditioning homes and businesses worldwide. One can argue that these points of comparison are essential in our daily lives, but so is Bitcoin in this period wherein people and institutions are searching for better ways to hedge their wealth and are looking for a way to mitigate the cost and time it takes to transmit money across borders. To arm themselves for the halving, Bitcoin miners are now upgrading their facilities to increase their hashrates. Of course, these would mean higher electricity requirements amid the reduction of rewards for mining a block from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Notwithstanding federal laws, these challenges would force them to constantly find ways to innovate and save on their expenses. In this case, miners with access to cheap and renewable energy sources will have the highest probability of prospering in the highly competitive space. As a result, miners are now reaping the advances in harnessing solar energy to have an infinite amount of power source. Along the way, solar energy producers are incentivized by the rising demand to research and develop more ways to make solar farming and energy distribution more viable. Others like Bitdeer in its Bhutan arm are sourcing hydroelectric power for their Bitcoin mining activities. This trend will likely carry on as superpowers like the US and China have exhibited a shift to renewable energy going forward which makes up 22.5% and 30.2% of their electricity generation respectively according to Medium. El Salvador has even suggested harvesting geothermal energy coming from a volcano. While a lot of pundits are calling the idea outrageous, be reminded that California has already been getting a part of its energy supply from the heat produced by geysers near a volcano based on the United States Geological Survey (USGS). So, consider the idea of the Central American nation as an upgrade of that concept. What’s more, Bitcoin miners are now studying a novel solution for getting power supply from stranded energy like those coming from gas flaring. Gas flaring is the practice of burning natural gas to extract oil. These are just a few examples of what we have now. For sure, many other methods will be introduced as the Bitcoin mining industry gives energy producers more reasons to revolutionize. Overall, the future of Bitcoin mining is expected to provide an avenue to convert untapped, excess, or wasted energy into a digital asset that has the potential to uplift people, communities, and nations through its equitable and decentralized design."
2024-02-08 17:19:43+00:00,"Bitcoin Recaptures The $45K Mark, What’s Going On?",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-recaptures-the-45k-mark-whats-going-on/,"Bitcoin (BTC) just shot up today to breach the $45K line, which it lost on January 12 this year. What could be the reason behind the current uptick in the digital asset’s price? As of 4:30 PM UTC, Bitcoin suddenly spiked by more than 5% to $45,300 in the 24-hour chart. This was coupled with an 86% increase in trading volume as $28.72 billion worth of BTC moved between wallets and exchanges. During this time, the prices hovered between a $43,000 low and a $45,440 high. The surge led to the overall valuation of Bitcoin’s 19.62 million circulating supply to $888.97 billion, which in turn brought its volume/market cap ratio at 3.21%. Zooming the chart to the seven-day run of the coin shows a 6.5% gain but the monthly chart only got a 0.5% nudge on the upside. But then again, compressing the numbers within a yearly frame displays a whopping 98% recovery for the crypto asset. So far, the premier crypto by market cap is still 34% away from regaining the price it lost from its all-time high of $68,789 per BTC back in November 2021. However, many signs and important events in the financial world may eventually lead it there, and many analysts think that Bitcoin may even surpass those numbers. The primary cause of Bitcoin’s sudden rally to the $45K range is the waning confidence of investors in the capacity of US banks to sustain themselves according to CNBC. This FUD over the banking sector was reinforced by the dipping shares of the New York Community Bancorp (NYCB) on Thursday. The source observed that this has been the trend since the regional banking crisis last year. Turmoil in the banking and traditional finance (TradFi) sectors seemed to work in favor of Bitcoin as of late. Another factor is the rising optimism of investors in Bitcoin itself. Whales, or those with at least 1,000 BTC in their wallet, have been noticeably hoarding more of the supply in the past two weeks. One of them happened to be the analytics firm MicroStrategy, which has now grown its stash to 190,000 BTC or approximately $8.55 billion at present rates. “What’s happening now appears to be large investors — whales, institutions, others — accumulating assets ahead of what many believe will be a strong bull cycle through the end of the year,” said Cube.Exchange CEO Bartosz Lipiński in an interview. “One only needs to look at the number of Bitcoin wallets holding more than 1,000 BTC, which has risen significantly over the last two weeks and now includes an additional 73 participants that previously weren’t holding such a significant amount of the cryptocurrency.” Let’s add to these the looming federal meltdown ominously hinted by the information spewed by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell during an interview with CBS’ 60 Minutes wherein he admitted that the country may be heading toward an “unsustainable fiscal path.” This unfortunately jived with the bleak outlooks of experts like veteran investor Jim Rogers and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. All these are happening in the background as the Bitcoin halving nears, which should further tighten BTC supply amid the rising demand of institutional players for the digital asset. So, better strap on your seatbelts folks! The following months could be a bumpy ride to the top!"
2024-02-07 09:34:46+00:00,Bitcoin Mining Firm CleanSpark Gets Into Gear To Prepare For The Halving,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-mining-firm-cleanspark-gets-into-gear-to-prepare-for-the-halving/,"Bitcoin mining firms are now arming themselves for the upcoming BTC halving. One of them is CleanSpark, which is now on an aggressive expansion to gear up for the fallout of the event. This ignited a surge in its stock as of Tuesday’s market close. The fourth epoch of the Bitcoin halving coming in April is set to reduce BTC mining rewards from the current 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. Although the resulting scarcity in the long run will benefit investors, this is expected to trim down the players within the Bitcoin mining sector. The first casualties would be the businesses operating on a smaller scale. With the fight for survival in the field anticipated to intensify post-halving, large Bitcoin mining firms are now racing to upgrade their hardware to improve their processing capabilities and increase their chances of success in mining their prized blocks. To prepare itself for the pivotal affair, CleanSpark successfully negotiated a deal to acquire three “turnkey” sites in Mississippi to the tune of $19.8 million. The transaction is expected to be finalized in about 21 days, and it’s projected to immediately pump the company’s Bitcoin mining operations by 2.4 exahashes per second (EH/s). The company also revealed its target to buy one more plant in Dalton, Georgia, with a downpayment of $3.4 million followed by $3.5 million to launch the project around April. This will add another 0.8 EH/s to its capacity and widen its presence in the area to three sites. “Our move into Mississippi is all about growing our operations and diversifying our data center portfolio in a measured way,” CleanSpark CEO Zachary Bradford stated in an interview with CNBC. “Our operations in Georgia have given us significant experience in southeastern power markets.” “Mississippi is in the same electric reliability region, so we see a lot of synergies there,” he added. The energization of these facilities plus the expansion in Sandersville is estimated to double CleanSpark’s overall hashrate from 10 EH/s to 20 EH/s.The boost in operations is forecasted to add 14% in the miner’s revenue. CleanSpark has had a tumultuous history as its shares went from an all-time high of $59 back in 2018 down to just above a dollar in 2020. It again climbed to a peak of $38.90 during the bull run of 2021 before diving below the $2 mark during the crypto winter of 2022. It finally got out of the penny stocks category in the final months of 2023 as the crypto market rallied. The recent announcement of the Bitcoin miner triggered a bullish sentiment toward its stock, which resulted in its climb from a $7.64 low to an $8.72 high on Tuesday. As of market close, the price settled at $8.70 with a 12.11% gain within the trading day."

Michael Saylor just announced another 850 BTC purchase made by the company last January amounting to $37.2 million, which increases its total holdings to 190,000 BTC. In January, @MicroStrategy acquired an additional 850 BTC for $37.2 million and now holds 190,000 BTC. Please join us at 5pm ET as we discuss our Q4 2023 financial results and answer questions about our #bitcoin strategy and business outlook. $MSTR https://t.co/j5SbcELsue According to the latest report of MicroStrategy, it bought 850 BTC in January 2024 for $37.2 million. This means it now owns a total of 190,000 BTC purchased at $5.93 billion or an average of $31,224 per Bitcoin as of February 5, 2024. In today’s rate at around $42,900 per BTC (as of 4:45 UTC), this already amounts to $8.15 billion, which means an unrealized gain of around $2.22 billion for the analytics firm. There’s an overall bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market right now, thanks to the success of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, the upcoming halving in Bitcoin mining rewards, growing institutional adoption of crypto and tokenized assets, and the looming economic pressures in the US as well as China. With these, Bitcoin is expected to gain a new all-time high this year that may surpass its 2021 peak. Saylor emphasized in his earlier statements that they’re not selling. Well, it remains to be seen when prices go off the roof. But then again, if demand further overwhelms the circulating supply, this would give MicroStrategy unprecedented control over the digital asset, especially if its acquisition continues. The present circulating supply of Bitcoin sits at 19.62 million. This means MicroStrategy now owns 0.96% of the float. In June 2020, MicroStrategy announced its initial purchase of 12,333 Bitcoin for $347 million. This made it the first publicly traded company to allocate its capital in the digital asset. Following that, the company displayed major growth in its share price at around 305%, which even dwarfed tech stocks like Google and Microsoft. It has also overtaken Bitcoin in performance by 45%. “We don’t need to address any of the currency criticisms anymore,” Saylor told Cointelegraph in an interview. “Simply as a store of value, there’s no reason Bitcoin can’t continue to outperform and 100X from where it is right now.” There are concerns, however, that the continuous allocation of MicroStrategy in the digital asset may turn its financials more volatile. This could make its accounting very challenging according to Bloomberg. Nevertheless, Saylor’s optimism runs high for the crypto asset this year. “2024 is the year of the birth of Bitcoin as an institutional-grade asset class, in fact, it’s the first new asset class of the modern era,” the die-hard Bitcoin supporter said. “The next 15 years will be a regulated, institutional, high growth period for Bitcoin, very different from the last 15 years.” #Bitcoin is Timeless. pic.twitter.com/Y8ZXXg7hhd"
2024-02-06 20:53:50+00:00,Veteran Investor Foresees Federal Meltdown And It Could Benefit Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/veteran-investor-sees-a-federal-meltdown-benefitting-bitcoin/,"Veteran investor Jim Rogers has a bleak outlook on the economic status of the US in the coming years that could potentially trigger a massive Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoin rally. Recently, US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that they have decided to maintain the status quo concerning interest rates. With that, the numbers remain in the 5.25% to 5.50% range. Along the way, Powell dismissed the idea of a rate cut by March that some financial analysts had anticipated. He also remarked that there’s no need to reduce the target until inflation is moving sustainably toward the two percent mark. The Fed Chair once again emphasized these during an interview on CBS’ 60 Minutes interview. However, it came with some shocking admissions that led Rogers to deduce during an interview with Kitco that the US economy may be heading out to an “unsustainable fiscal path.” Power confirmed that the US debt has gone out of control since the COVID-19 pandemic and its ensuing lockdowns. The central bank head confessed that the debt is “growing faster than the economy,” and right now, the country is “borrowing from future generations.” This was reflected in the Congressional Budget Office’s warning that the nation’s debt is spiraling to reach $144 trillion by 2053. The numbers are equivalent to every future American household owing $1 million, thanks to the present government. Rogers feared that the increasing debt of the nation, which is now over $34 trillion, would be a catalyst for the recession. For him, it could be “the worst in [his] lifetime.” “In 2008, we had a big problem, but the debt everywhere has skyrocketed since then,” said Rogers. “So the next recession has to be the worst in my lifetime because the debt is so much higher now than it has ever been before in my lifetime. Even China has a lot of debt now.” “The US dollar is not a sound currency anymore,” the co-founder of the Quantum Fund and Soros Fund Management cautioned. “We’re the largest debtor nation in the history of the world. But everybody thinks it’s a sound currency, and they think it’s a safe haven. So, when problems come, people race to a safe haven.” If push comes to shove, Roger suspects that the government may ban Bitcoin and other crypto if it sees them as a credible threat to the stability and dominance of the US dollar. He concluded with an ominous prediction of an impending market crash this year as he already sees “the signs.” Despite Rogers dragging Bitcoin into his catastrophic viewpoint, other experts expect the opposite. For them, the Wall Street turbulence coupled with the growing institutional adoption of crypto and the upcoming supply shock of Bitcoin in its halving may just be the recipe needed to get the crypto bulls stampeding to all-new heights. Forbes, citing a survey conducted by Finder with 40 industry experts, reveals an optimistic projection that puts the future price of Bitcoin at $88K for this year. CoinFlip Chair Daniel Polotsky, however, takes the figures up to $100K."
2024-02-06 16:30:37+00:00,Legal Battle Heats: Craig Wright’s Satoshi Claim Under Scrutiny Amid Forgery Allegations,https://blockzeit.com/legal-battle-heats-craig-wrights-satoshi-claim-under-scrutiny-amid-forgery-allegations/,"Australian Computer Scientist Craig Wright has earned himself some five weeks of intensive legal hearing to determine whether he’s Bitcoin‘s mastermind Satoshi Nakamoto as he claims. Wright is being sued by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) for creating a false narrative with fake documents to prove he’s Satoshi and coming at anyone who questioned his stance. The trial which began yesterday in a UK courtroom is expected to lay the argument to rest once and for all. The Cryptocurrency and Tech worlds have failed to successfully crack the identity of Bitcoin’s mystery guy for over a decade now. Nothing is known about Satoshi Nakomoto’s identity, except for the popular 2008 Bitcoin white paper published under the fictitious Japanese name. Eight years later amid the puzzle, appears computer science whiz Craig Wright, claiming he was the one everyone was looking for and the author of the revolutionary white paper. But why would the self-acclaimed high-profile figure in Bitcoin’s evolution stay silent for that long before making the claims he now makes? Wright revealed in a BBC interview, that he never wanted to go public about his identity but was forced into doing so because of how the speculations negatively impacted him and those he cared about. “There are lots of stories out there that have been made up and I don’t like it hurting those people I care about. I don’t want any of them to be impacted by this,” he said. The stories Wright referred to were publications by media organizations hinting at his involvement with the Bitcoin project after the Australian Tax Office raided his home in connection with a tax payment investigation. He pointed out that the unnecessary publicity and scrutiny imposed on him had driven his desire to break out of his shell. Wright first proved his identity to BBC, the Economist, and London Reviews, who all reported his claims on the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym on May 2, 2016. He could digitally sign messages with some of the “original” cryptographic keys directly linked to Bitcoin blocks mined by Nakamoto. In addition, stakeholders in the Bitcoin development team also supported his claims of being Nakamoto. Software Developer and Chief Scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation Gavin Anderson was one of the most prominent figures to publicly agree with Wright as being the long-lost Bitcoin creator. In a blog post dated May 2016, Anderson narrated how he flew to London to meet Dr. Wright and categorically said “After spending time with him I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt: Craig Wright is Satoshi.” According to Anderson, he spent part of the time with Wright in “careful cryptographic verification of messages signed with keys that only Satoshi should possess.” So far, the signing with cryptographic keys seems to be the closest evidence to him being Nakamoto. However, Anderson returned in February last year with a regret message which he attached to the top of the 2016 attestation post. “I don’t believe in rewriting history, so I’m going to leave this post up. But in the seven years since I wrote it, a lot has happened, and I now know it was a mistake to trust Craig Wright as much as I did. I regret getting sucked into the “who is (or isn’t) Satoshi” game, and I refuse to play that game anymore,” said Anderson. The other outstanding evidence is Wright’s claim to the copyright of the Bitcoin white paper – a claim which he’s supported with early manuscripts. In response to Wright, COPA’s lawyer told the London court that his claim is “a brazen lie, an elaborate false narrative supported by forgery on an industrial scale.” The Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), in 2021, filed a lawsuit against Mr. Wright in a UK High Court to prove that “he does not have copyright ownership over the Bitcoin white paper.” The lawsuit was also in solidarity with the Bitcoin developer community and other people whom Wright has threatened for using the white paper in some ways. The five-week-long legal process to disprove Wright’s claims to the Bitcoin white paper’s copyright kicked off this Monday with oral arguments from both sides. The proceedings before the presiding court Sir Edwards James Mellor were followed live by about 400 people from different parts of the globe. “Dr Wright’s claim to be Satoshi is a lie, founded on an elaborate false narrative and backed by forgery of documents on an industrial scale,” said COPA’s lawyer, Jonathan Hough, in his opening statement. Wright’s legal team led by lawyer Anthony Grainger denied the plaintiff’s allegation, claiming that Wright has the requisite skills, experience, and qualifications to build Bitcoin. According to his team, he’s provided substantial evidence already, and his opponent has been unable to present an alternative person as Nakamoto. While there are mixed views to Wright’s claims, the question of whether he’s Nakamoto should be resolved in the next few weeks."
2024-02-05 11:36:15+00:00,Expect A “Sell The News” Event During The Bitcoin Halving,https://blockzeit.com/expect-a-sell-the-news-event-during-the-bitcoin-halving/,"There’s no exact date as to when the next Bitcoin (BTC) halving will happen, but the consensus puts it between April 18 and 20. The halving is bound to reduce the mining rewards of the cryptocurrency, which normally fuels super bullish sentiment in the community as the countdown comes to a close. However, an analytics firm warns of a “sell the news” event looming in the immediate aftermath of the affair. According to DecenTrader, Bitcoin will likely hover sideways before the trading for the halving starts. The trend will gradually shift upwards once buying interest for BTC is triggered around six weeks prior to the pivotal event. Assuming that the halving will be occurring as early as April 18, the timeframe for the major move would be within the second week of March. With that said, Bitcoin has more than a month before investors are hit with the FOMO frenzy. Then, given the propensity of BTC to front-run the “sell the news” event, it could go up to the previous two-year high of $49K before quashing expectations with a sudden correction. During this phase, the mettle of HODLers will be tested as the post-halving months will be a long period of consolidation with some bumps along the way. However, those who will be able to survive the ordeal will be rewarded with an all-time high by the fourth quarter of the year, which should be prompted by the Uptober fever in October or late rally in December. The analysts of the firm foresee BTC dumping as low as $37K when it loses its strong base in April before replicating the two-year high we had at $49K. From then on, it could go sideways and even struggle at the $30K bracket prior to its mooning by the fourth quarter. Be reminded, though, that some events could disrupt the forecast of DecenTrader as noted by a recent Coinbase report. One of them is the possible exhaustion of Bitcoin from the continuous downward selling pressure caused by the “sell the news” phenomenon taking place upon the approval of the much-anticipated spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US and the massive sell-off of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) following the huge liquidation of the FTX Bankruptcy estate. Another is the anticipated announcement of interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve by May. Any or both of these factors could pre-empt, move in conjunction, or deter the timelines set by Decentrader. Nevertheless, as exhibited by the previous cycles, each halving is guaranteed to trigger an all-new supply scarcity for Bitcoin in one way or another. The increased demand, especially now that more institutional players are in the game, will surely spike BTC prices to never-seen-before heights."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2024-02-05 05:42:22+00:00,Coinbase Says Bitcoin Is “Exhausted” From The Downward Pressure,https://blockzeit.com/coinbase-says-bitcoin-is-exhausted-from-the-downward-pressure/,"A new analysis from Coinbase sees the downward pressure on Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies becoming too “exhausted.” The crypto exchange believes that this could signal a shift of the trend toward a bullish momentum. The Coinbase report starts by saying, “Many technical factors pressuring crypto performance to the downside are starting to be exhausted, in our view, which may give way to a more supportive trading environment in the weeks ahead.” Based on its explanation, the downward pressure caused by the massive selling of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust funds coming from the bankruptcy estate of FTX is easing up. So far, this has resulted in the liquidation of 22 million GBTC shares. Meanwhile, the supportive trading environment of the market is beginning to take shape as the net inflows of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have averaged above $200 million daily in the past week. This brought up the total net inflows of these financial instruments to $146 billion since January 11 while the daily volume sat around $1.35. The massive recovery of the market is also considered to be nigh as some “large defunct entities” in the cryptocurrency sector like Celsius are staging a comeback. “We expect rate cuts in the US to start in May and the tapering of quantitative tightening soon after, coinciding with idiosyncratic events like the bitcoin halving and creating a positive setup for the asset class more broadly,” Coinbase also noted. For added context, the US Federal Reserve recently announced that it’s keeping the interest rates between the 5.25% and 5.50% levels. Fed Chair Jerome Powell quashed expectations of a rate cut by March as the policymakers are yet to see “greater confidence” that inflation is already heading toward a sustainable path to 2%. He stated that the US economy has not yet achieved a soft landing, too, but he remarked he is “encouraged by the progress.” Coinbase echoed the same optimism in its comments as it said, “In the US, the likelihood of a soft landing seems higher than it was a few months ago with the economy ostensibly making only minimal tradeoffs between activity and inflation.” “Core PCE inflation (the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of prices) at 2.7% YoY is trending in line with their 2% long-run target, and the assortment of recent economic indicators has been fairly resilient,” the report explained. Considering the high correlation of Bitcoin to the stock market and altcoins tending to move in unison with BTC, the coming halving in April plus the positive sentiments in the stock market in May could potentially trigger both worlds into an uptrend all the way to Q2 2024."
2024-02-05 02:22:25+00:00,Craig Wright’s Trial To Prove He’s Satoshi Nakamoto Starts Today,https://blockzeit.com/craig-wrights-trial-to-prove-hes-satoshi-nakamoto-starts-today/,"Dr. Craig Wright’s crusade to prove that he’s the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin (BTC), continues. Today, February 5, he is set to step in a London court to attest to that. In 2021, Twitter (now X) founder Jack Dorsey’s payment portal Block, Brian Armstrong’s crypto exchange Coinbase, and other key names in the financial tech (FinTech) sector banded together under the banner of the Crypto Open Alliance (Copa) to file a case against Wright in a UK court to have him denied of ownership of the original Bitcoin whitepaper. According to Copa, the lawsuit seeks to have a “negative declaration” of Wright’s continuous claim as the creator of Bitcoin. This should “conclusively show that Dr. Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto and will not be able to continue to threaten developers.” Copa alleged that the documents Wright produced to back his claim had been forgeries. So far, the claimant hasn’t provided any conclusive proof that he’s truly the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto. “If Wright were truly Satoshi, it would be easy for him to prove it beyond any doubt,” opined Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal last week. “But he cannot.” “Wright’s trove of forged documents is at the heart of COPA’s litigation that begins next week,” he added. “In fact, two experts hired by Wright himself have already acknowledged that many of Wright’s documents are forged.” Last month, Wright reportedly tried to settle the case. The conditions included making the parties donate a substantial amount to a church in Australia and to silence critics from making any more media campaigns against him. Likewise, he asked unnamed entities to stop representing themselves as the embodiment of the original vision for Bitcoin. Wright’s move was declined by Copa though. This was also seen by the crypto community as a lack of confidence on the claimant’s part that he would be able to win the lawsuit. “Hard pass on that ‘settlement,’” posted by Copa on X. “Just like Craig Wright forges documents and doesn’t quite tell the truth, his description of the settlement offer isn’t quite accurate either – it comes with loopholes that would allow him to sue people all over again.” Wright has been asserting his claim since 2016. During that time, he gained widespread coverage in the mass media, including the BBC, the Economist, and GQ. However, his arguments have proven to be inconclusive. One of Wright’s key failures to nail his point is his inability to access the first 1.1 million Bitcoin mined by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, which should be over $46 billion at the present $42K per BTC rate. Back in 2022, the claimant stated in a Norwegian court that he had already destroyed the computer hard drive containing his keys. Now, who in their right senses would do just that? Another feeble attempt to lay his ownership of the original idea of Bitcoin was when he handed a document of the cryptocurrency’s whitepaper. Again, this was shunned by the consensus because the formatting and software used were different from that of the original whitepaper. The opposition said the LaTex file produced by Wright only directs to a PDF of the whitepaper. Furthermore, the file’s metadata revealed that it was only made on November 19, 2023, from scratch. One attached document even had a high probability to have been constructed via OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The upcoming court battle will surely shape the trajectory of Bitcoin going forward. While the chances of Wright winning the case appear to be slim based on his unconvincing claims, the opposite scenario could shake up the very foundations of the cryptosphere in a very negative way."
2024-02-02 09:41:55+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rallies Back To $44,000 As Fed Holds Interest Rates Steady",https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-rallies-back-to-44000-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady/,"Bitcoin price experienced an unexpected move to the upside this week, catching the market unawares. The asset rose and touched a high of $43,733 before colling off from the run. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $43,193 today. This represents a +2.5% price increase in the last 24 hours and a +7.9% price decrease in the past 7 days. Bitcoin dominance rose this week, accompanied by a huge boost in its market cap. The increase in market cap was attributed to the rise in the past week’s price and the addition of over 6,000 BTC into circulation. Compared to last week, around 3,000 BTC were added to the supply, and BTC emission is up 50%. Last week Bitcoin showed signs of weakness, threatening to move downward at the slightest provocation. The price was steadily below the 50-day moving average and also hanging outside the one-month-long consolidation zone. However, BTC pulled a 180-degree turn on the market and began heading back up. As of the time of writing Bitcoin is firmly inside the ranging zone.  As pointed out in the chart the breakout lower from the consolidation zone proved to be nothing but a liquidity hunt by smart money. By now, a clear pattern is beginning to emerge, and it involves ranges and stop hunts – a clear smart money tactic of accumulating liquidity before pushing the price higher. Bitcoin is currently trending above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages which is a bullish sign for BTC. BTC is expected to continue with trend upwards going into next week.  Bollinger Bands indicators mark out an expected target of $45,460, which is just above the supply zone of the range.  Serving as a small stop hunt, the asset is expected to correct back to the middle Bollinger band (around $42,428) before bouncing off it and heading higher. The overall performance of Bitcoin is based on whether the market makers are done accumulating. If yes, we could see BTC rise to reclaim the previous yearly high of $49,048.

This surprisingly came from his own admission. Kiyosaki, the famous author of the best-selling finance book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” has been in the Bitcoin game for an indeterminate amount of time. Some say he began investing in it before the previous crypto bull run cycle. Nonetheless, he hasn’t been letting people into much detail about his BTC investment, so we couldn’t exactly pinpoint the period when he started and how much he owns. The investor just kept on saying that he “bought early” to quell the questions. Around two months before the historic approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US, the veteran investor revealed that he just accumulated more Bitcoin. Again, he didn’t disclose any numbers, but with the way he shilled the crypto, it was probably a hefty amount. Along the way, he built up hype with his bold predictions ranging from a hundred thousand dollars to a million per BTC. Of course, no one dared to question him more about where he was getting such figures — given his status in the industry. As it turns out, he really knew nothing about Bitcoin and was just riding on the bandwagon of his fellow investors. “I always say ‘gold, silver, and Bitcoin,’ I know nothing about Bitcoin. I just know some very smart people are in it, and thank God I bought early,” the finance guru admitted in an interview. Little is known about whatever technical tool Kiyosaki is employing for his forecasts. Despite that, his nuggets of information do present wise bits of advice in dealing with finance. Kiyosaki’s recommendations are mostly inclined toward the diversification of investments in real estate, commodities, and gold. In the digital realm, he obviously has a well-known penchant for Bitcoin. The veteran investor has also never been shy of telling people about his distrust of the US financial system. Recently, he fired up his X account with a post explaining why he was heavily invested in Bitcoin. For him, it was a way to protect his wealth against potential theft by the people running the government and Wall Street bankers. He added that it’s free from market manipulation, safeguarded against unfair taxation, and shielded from inflation unlike fiat money, bonds, and stocks. Why I own Bitcoin. Bitcoin is protection against the theft of our wealth via our money. Fed Chairman Powell, Treasury Secretary Yellin, and Wall Street bankers steal our wealth via our money, specifically via inflation, taxation, & stock price manipulation. That is why I save…"

BlackRock and Fidelity remain as powerhouses in this sector as both have increased their BTC supply to back their spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to a new report, BlackRock and Fidelity now have a combined haul of 107,696 BTC. At present values of $42K to $43K per BTC, the numbers translate to a whopping price of around $4.6 billion. JUST IN: 🇺🇸 BlackRock and Fidelity now own a combined 107,696 #BTC worth $4.6 billion for their spot #Bitcoin ETFs. pic.twitter.com/v1DrcZvqRw The new financial instruments in the US based on the BTC price movements continue to defy expectations while their proponents continue to amass whatever Bitcoin they can get their hands on like it’s the last box of sweets on the candy store aisle. All these help build renewed optimism for Bitcoin as the halving nears and as the US faces both economic and political pressures within its sphere of influence. For the crypto community, the climbing figures in the metrics represent the growing shift in confidence of traditional finance (TradFi) toward Bitcoin. This perception is believed to eventually trickle down to other crypto assets, which means they are here to stay and gives hope that it could help in their legitimacy. In related news, American financier and former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci praised BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s shift in perspective toward Bitcoin. He said the giant asset investment firm’s boss has surely done “his homework.” “I’m going to give Larry a lot of credit, because Larry actually did the homework,” Scaramucci remarked on the spot Bitcoin ETF campaign of Fink’s company. “It takes a very smart leader to pridefully say that Bitcoin sucks and then 24 months later say ‘you know what I got this wrong, BlackRock needs to be a part of this.’” Scaramucci was clearly referring to Fink’s previous antagonistic stance on Bitcoin when he consistently called it “an index of money laundering” only to backtrack with his statement later when the CEO hyped the crypto asset as “bigger than any government.” Scaramucci also shared his bullish outlook on post-halving Bitcoin. The entrepreneur forecasted BTC’s climb from a potential dip of $35,000 to at least $170,000 after the halving in April, thanks to a foreseen shrinkage in the coin’s circulating supply and the sense of scarcity brought about by the event. “I’m using a $35,000 number at the halving and that’s conservative … Let’s say we’re at $50,000 in April, then it’s a $200,000 handle. Let’s say we’re at $60,000, it will be $240,000,” explained Scaramucci during an interview with Scott Melker."
2024-01-31 06:36:03+00:00,"Is The $250,000 Per Bitcoin Target Of Tim Draper Still On?",https://blockzeit.com/is-the-250000-per-bitcoin-target-of-tim-draper-still-on/,"Venture capitalist Tim Draper has been on the radar of the cryptocurrency community since he correctly predicted the rise of Bitcoin (BTC) to $10,000 by the exact year. His next projection following that was the rise of the digital asset to $250,000 by 2022. With a year past his deadline, he revised his forecast to 2025 last year. Now that we’re just months away from that timeframe, is he still going by those numbers? Recently, Bloomberg Television interviewed Draper for some nugget of information about Bitcoin and his political views. The segment kicked off by reminding viewers of his bold prediction back in June 2018. “We’ll continue to see Bitcoin move higher,” Draper can be recalled telling people. “I’ve revised my estimate up to $250,000 four years out, so we Bitcoin trade around the $250,000 mark in 2022.” That, obviously, didn’t happen as BTC only went to an all-time high of $68,789 in November 2021 before diving to the $16K territory in the succeeding year until the start of 2023. As a result, the VC moved revised his schedule to 2025. So, as it usually went in his previous interviews, Draper was once again asked about his thoughts on the subject. Evidently sounding tired of getting asked the same question over and over, the entrepreneur replied to Bloomberg, “Well, I don’t know why anybody is still listening to me if I missed that one.” Draper then went on to admit that his forecast failed to account for several factors. First of all, he blamed the paranoia of the US government in the digital asset for the missed target. Then, the veteran investor pointed out that he expected the government to have been able to figure out how to tax it and allow people to do business with it by that time. Draper cited as an example of how other countries are now embracing BTC like Argentina and Nigeria because their people have lost trust in their native currencies. He criticized the apparent fear of the US upon the realization that “Bitcoin is actually better for everyone.” “It keeps perfect records and you know, the people who they all thought were criminals using Bitcoin, it turns out they were all caught,” Draper mused. “So, using dollars is probably better for a criminal.” Along the way, Draper expressed his optimism toward Bitcoin finally being used the way the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto has envisioned, and that’s an alternative currency for the exchange of goods and services without being subjected to political control. The interview concluded without Draper ever mentioning the $250,000 numbers again after the recap but he did affirm his belief that there’s more to come in Bitcoin, especially with the halving on the horizon this April."
2024-01-30 16:49:28+00:00,Just In: Bitcoin Halving Party Announced By Bitcoin Magazine And Kraken,https://blockzeit.com/just-in-bitcoin-halving-party-announced-by-bitcoin-magazine-and-kraken/,"Two of the oldest names in the cryptocurrency realm are partnering up to celebrate the biggest event in digital finance, the Bitcoin (BTC) halving. Bitcoin Magazine, the oldest publication focused on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, is partnering with Kraken, one of the oldest crypto exchanges in the world, to hold a New Year’s Eve-like party for this pivotal affair. Today, on January 30th, Bitcoin Magazine announced the 2024 Bitcoin Halving Livestream. As the name of the occasion suggests, it will celebrate the fourth halving milestone of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The event, organized in collaboration with Kraken, will feature a variety show participated by popular personalities linked to Bitcoin. This will be live-streamed at Bitcoinhalving.com straight from Nashville, Tennessee, and it will begin once the 839,979th Bitcoin block has been mined. The zenith of the year-end-like party will occur upon the arrival of the 840,000th Bitcoin block. Owing to the unpredictability of the process of Bitcoin mining, there’s no telling the exact time of the halving. The organizers consider such an unpredictability to be one of the thrills of the affair. However, the Bitcoin publication estimates the landmark instance happening around April 18. Another highlight of the show is the declaration of the Bitcoin Halving Challenge winners. The lucky participants will partake in the 1 BTC prize pooled by sponsors. “This event is not just a celebration of Bitcoin’s fourth epoch but a testament to the unyielding spirit of the Bitcoin community,” remarked Bitcoin Magazine President Mike Germano. “It’s an honor to mark this historic occasion, reflecting on our journey and looking forward to the boundless future of Bitcoin.” “As two companies that have been industry leaders in driving Bitcoin awareness and adoption since the first halving back in 2012, it was only right to collaborate in bringing to light some of the most memorable moments of the last epoch and power the insightful conversations to come around this next historic halving,” commented Kraken Director of Brand Partnerships Lou Frangella. Both parties expect to boost the adoption of crypto worldwide via the historic event. Every Bitcoin halving increases the mining difficulty of BTC while reducing its rewards by half. The event is cryptographically programmed to trigger every 210,000 blocks mined. There have been three halvings since the launch of Bitcoin in January 2009. The first happened on November 28, 2012, cutting the mining rewards from the initial 50 to 25 BTC. The subsequent events occurred on July 9, 2016, and May 11, 2020, which reduced the Bitcoin mining rewards to 12.5 and 6.25 coins, respectively. The halving is estimated to happen every four years, and it will continue until the last or the 21 millionth Bitcoin has been mined. There are varying projections about the advent of the next epoch, but besides the forecast of Bitcoin Magazine, some analysts place it around April 19."
2024-01-30 05:25:02+00:00,"Google Updates Crypto Policy, Giving Way To Bitcoin ETF Ads",https://blockzeit.com/google-updates-crypto-policy-giving-way-to-bitcoin-etf-ads/,"Google saw the approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) coming from a month away. Prior to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighting these financial products from 11 companies, the tech firm already released new guidelines tailored to them. A couple of hours ago, the company updated it to expound on its scope. On December 6, 2023, Google said that it aimed to supply adequate information to users so they could make knowledgeable decisions when dealing with crypto assets. Along the way, it emphasized the risks they carried and how some of them were subjected to fraudulent activities. The rules highlighted the management, investment, and personal advice aspects of crypto products. The company also reminded advertisers to comply with the state and local regulations of the jurisdictions where their marketing campaigns were directed. Google warned that violation of its terms will result in a warning issued within seven days upon discovery of the offense. This will eventually lead to an account suspension if proven true. During that time, the tech firm laid down a provision saying that it will update its “Cryptocurrencies and related products policy” by January 2024. This is to clarify the scope and requirements of Cryptocurrency Coin Trust advertisers. On January 29, 2024, Google finally updated the terms to address Cryptocurrency Coin Trusts for US customers. It provided a general definition of the term to include “financial products that allow investors to trade shares in trusts holding large pools of digital currency.” In other words, it specifically targeted spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. The latest move of Google marked a pivotal shift in its regulations on cryptocurrencies since 2018. Before this, the company, together with other giant tech firms like Facebook (now Meta), banned ads linked to cryptos. This was seen as a way for them to prevent their users from falling prey to the scams being proliferated employing these digital assets. Almost immediately after Google’s policy update, ads from BlackRock and VanEck have noticeably started appearing on the platform’s “sponsored” tabs. Others soon followed to capitalize on the reach of the company’s native search engine. Google’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETF ads will surely widen the reach of these financial instruments as the ads could pique the interest of people who are not yet familiar with them. Of course, this has resulted in more bullish hype for Bitcoin, the crypto asset the ETFs are tracking, which pumped its value over 2% in the 24-hour chart. As of this writing at 5:00 AM UTC, BTC went up around $43,400, taking its market cap to $851.55 billion. A noticeable surge in trading volume was also observed during the period because it soared by over 38% as $22.42 billion worth of the digital asset moved between crypto exchanges and wallets. The same timeframe saw Bitcoin swing from a $41,818 low to a $43,750 high."
2024-01-29 14:34:29+00:00,Harvest Fund Management Files For First Spot Bitcoin ETF In Hong Kong,https://blockzeit.com/harvest-fund-management-files-for-first-spot-bitcoin-etf-in-hong-kong/,"Last year, news surfaced that Hong Kong is preparing for the arrival of its own spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). During that time, however, the territory’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) was only waiting for its US counterpart’s move. Now that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has greenlit these financial instruments in the West, the Chinese Special Administrative Region (SAR) seems ready to entertain them. According to Tencent News, Harvest Fund Management just filed an application to offer spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong on Friday. The Chinese company was the first to attempt entry into this sector within the SAR, so they may have only been watching the developments in the US before deciding to do so. Other asset managers in the burgeoning crypto hub of Asia are also reportedly in negotiations with the regulator. Among the big names mentioned by the source were Venture Smart Financial Holdings Limited (VSFG) and RD Technologies. The former expects to launch its spot Bitcoin ETF within this month. HK crypto exchange Hashkey’s COO, Livio Weng, revealed this month that around 10 companies are eyeing to enter the spot crypto ETF trade in the city. SFC has already foreseen the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US by the SEC even before the January 10 affair. That’s if Animoca Brands’ Chairman Yat Siu’s earlier interview is to be believed. “If you look at what the SFC had said about I think a month ago, it says that it was open to widen access to digital assets,” claimed Siu in an interview. “And frankly, Bitcoin spot ETF is, I would say, relatively uncontroversial at the end of the day.” Siu showed confidence that it would be easier for the SFC to comment or decide on any planned spot Bitcoin ETF because the US SEC has already done the research and laid down the guidelines. “I would imagine that [Hong Kong] would follow, especially because the U.S. has already done a lot of the work,” he added. The present performance of these assets in the US, which now have billions of dollars in cash flows, also presents a nice reference of the do’s and don’ts for the aspiring adopters of these kinds of financial instruments in the HK jurisdiction."
2024-01-29 12:30:02+00:00,"Bitcoin Could Breach $50,000 By The End of This Quarter Based On A Series Of Patterns",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-could-breach-the-50000-by-the-end-of-this-quarter/,"An emerging long-play series of patterns could lead Bitcoin (BTC) to the $50K territory that has long eluded traders since December 2021 on the way to the long crypto winter. If the indicator plotted by 10x Research’s Head of Research Markus Thielen bears fruit, we could see this bullish scenario pay off by the end of this quarter. Before going further, let’s take a quick look at the performance of Bitcoin. As of 11:30 AM UTC, the top cryptocurrency by market cap is trading around $42,200, showing a slight dive of 0.4% on the 24-hour chart. This brings the total valuation of BTC’s 19.61 million circulating supply to $829.2 billion. Meanwhile, zooming out the frame displays a growth of the coin by 3% in the seven-day range but a 1% dip in the monthly bracket. During this time, the transaction volume of Bitcoin also went up by 5% as $14.83 billion worth of the digital asset moved between wallets and crypto exchanges. The same period saw the coin trade between a $41,696 low and a $42,641 high. Bitcoin is about to reach its next halving by April when its mining difficulty is doubled while its rewards are cut down by 50%. Based on the countdown timer of Binance, we are just 74 days and 7 hours away from this monumental event in the realm of cryptocurrencies. Since this is a periodic event, which is now anticipated by the wider public, there lies a question as to whether or not the price of Bitcoin halving is already priced in the charts. Bitcoin is still clawing its way out of the “sell the news” affair that took place upon the approval of the US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on the price movements of the crypto. However, 10x Research’s Head of Research Markus Thielen sees a bigger picture forming amid the trend. “With reversal indicators suggesting that a tradeable low is in, we should focus on longs,” said Thielen. “From a risk management perspective, we should re-engage in long positions once bitcoin breaks above $43,000.” Thielen notably predicted Bitcoin’s slump to $38,000 following its 2023 high of $49,000. This time, the analyst’s forecast is mainly anchored on the Elliot Wave theory. For context, the concept is based on repeating patterns that consequently form waves. It is composed of five waves wherein the waves designated 1, 3, and 5 make up the primary trend or “impulse waves.” On the other hand, waves 2 and 4 are “retrace waves,” signifying retracement periods as the name implies. Thielen explained that the latest slide of BTC price from $49K to $38K falls into wave 4 of the Elliot Wave. This puts the trend we’re in at wave 5, which could result in an uptrend to $50k by March. “Elliot Wave analysis has also labeled this retracement to 38,522 as wave (4) with a wave (5) projection of 52,671 – potentially by the end of Q1, 2024,” the analyst expounded."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2024-01-29 08:41:52+00:00,"Another Bitcoin Boom Looms, Thanks To These Key Ingredients",https://blockzeit.com/another-bitcoin-boom-looms-thanks-to-these-key-ingredients/,"A perfect storm is brewing that could drive up Bitcoin (BTC) prices. Apart from the success of its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the looming halving, the current state of affairs in the US economy and politics could add up to the catalysts. Nobody describes the trajectory of the US economy better than JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. Yes, it’s the same guy who said he would shut down Bitcoin if he were the government. His recent statements against the administration could turn out to be just the tool we need to poke the crypto bulls. “It is a cliff, we see the cliff,” he was quoted saying in an interview. “It’s about 10 years out, we’re going 60 miles an hour [toward it].” Dimon’s remarks were made in reference to the nation’s ballooning debt, which puts the debt-to-GDP ratio above 100%. The JPMorgan head honcho projects it could get worse by 2035 when it pops to 130%. “And it’s a hockey stick,” he describes the shape of the trend on a chart. He warns that when the “hockey stick” comes into effect it will go downhill from there. The JPMorgan boss echoes the same sentiments aired by economists as the US Congress and White House have incessantly increased their spending. As of the latest report of Fox Business, the national debt has already surpassed $34 trillion. This is by far the highest level it achieved throughout history. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign is going full swing even though we’re still 10 months away until the next US presidential election. By now, it’s clear that he wants to undo what his successor did in his four-year term. One of the new armaments in his vendetta is his strong stance against central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). For him, these instruments pose a “dangerous threat to freedom” because they can be utilized by the government to control peoples’ finances. During his presidency, Trump stated that he is not a fan of Bitcoin and other crypto because he does not consider them as money. He also thinks their value is “highly volatile and based on thin air” and they can be employed to facilitate illegal activities. Fast-forward to the present, even though he has not directly endorsed Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, he has shown strong support for these digital assets through his various non-fungible token (NFT) projects. He is also a known holder of altcoins and even meme coins. With a leading presidential candidate having exposure to cryptocurrencies, the prospects of Trump making better calls in the regulation of these digital assets — should he win the coming election — is not far from realization. All these could help fuel the narrative that has encapsulated the very fabric of Bitcoin, and that’s its primary purpose as a hedge against economic and political uncertainties akin to gold. The ongoing success of Bitcoin ETFs and the looming scarcity of BTC after April’s halving could also provide the ideal recipe for an all-new stampede by the bulls."
2024-01-28 03:00:12+00:00,Vanguard Continues To Reject Bitcoin For These Reasons,https://blockzeit.com/vanguard-continues-to-reject-bitcoin-for-these-reasons/,"Vanguard is not buying the trend. This is something it made clear amid the regulatory approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US and their successful launch that garnered half a billion dollars of inflows in their first two days of trading. According to the latest statement of the investment giant, it’s not allowing a spot Bitcoin ETF in its offerings because the financial instrument is based on “an immature asset class that has little history, no inherent economic value, no cash flow, and can create havoc within a portfolio.” JUST IN: $7 trillion Vanguard says they're not allowing spot #Bitcoin ETFs because it is “an immature asset class that has little history, no inherent economic value, no cash flow, and can create havoc within a portfolio.” pic.twitter.com/OYczxM1hQd Is this really the case? Let’s break down what Vanguard just said about Bitcoin. Bitcoin only goes as far back as January 2009 but is now comparable to gold in how it is utilized as a hedge against geopolitical and economic uncertainties. This is now something that traditional finance (TradFi) powerhouses are gradually recognizing. One of the huge critics and now an ally of the digital asset is BlackRock. The company’s CEO Larry Fink has gone from telling people that Bitcoin is “an index of money laundering” to aligning it with gold. JUST IN: BlackRock CEO says #Bitcoin is ""no different than what gold represented for thousands of years. It is an asset class that protects you."" pic.twitter.com/8bdQMQOnHi “I believe it goes up if the world is frightened, if the people have fearful geopolitical risks, they’re fearful of their own risks,” Fink commented in an interview with CNBC following the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) nod for their iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT). “It’s no different than what gold represented over thousands of years. It is an asset class that protects you.” The pseudonymous developer of Bitcoin, going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, envisioned Bitcoin as both a store of value and a unit of exchange. However, its volatility over the years has put its basic purpose in question. Back in 2019, Bitcoin finished below $7,200. Two years later, it went on an all-time high of $68,789. Now, it is trading at around $42,100. While Sats or Satoshis, BTC’s smallest unit, is now widely used for small purchases and fund transfers, holders and merchants are still reluctant to adopt Bitcoin for large transactions due to its major price swings. Nevertheless, Bitcoin has found greater utility in jumpstarting economies as shown by El Salvador and how it is being employed to help the unbanked in rural African communities. . @BitcoinShooter covering the inspiring story of how rural Africa is getting electricity, how this transforms the future for families there and how Bitcoin mining was the undisputed catalystpic.twitter.com/LWmnjv94Fy Indeed, Bitcoin doesn’t generate cash flows because it neither offers dividends nor yields, but so is Fiat currency if it only stays in one’s pocket and is not invested. Unlike the latter though, the former has a known supply cap compared to the government’s incessant money printing. Likewise, BTC has now proven itself as a long-term haven for capital preservation due to its inflation-proof trait and rising value over time. Vanguard is correct in saying this because Bitcoin tends to go on major price swings. But then again, BTC’s volatility can only be felt if one trades it on a short-term basis. Bitcoin’s true value and stability can only be seen when one zooms out of the charts. Since its inception, BTC has constantly displayed price appreciation growing from a fraction of a dollar to what it is worth today. Imagine this, 10,000 BTC was only worth two Papa John’s pizzas back in 2010. Fast-forward to today, that same amount of Bitcoin is already worth nearly half a billion dollars, and we are not even computing the figures based on the crypto’s all-time high about three years ago."
2024-01-27 13:41:14+00:00,Bitwise’s Transparency Pays Off: Almost 1 Million Sats Flow Into Public Bitcoin Wallet,https://blockzeit.com/almost-1-million-sats-flow-into-bitwises-public-bitcoin-wallet/,"Bitwise, the world’s largest crypto index fund manager, has seen an inflow of almost 1 million Sats just a few days after going public with its Bitcoin custody address. The investment manager’s transparency echoed loudly beyond the industry after it became the first ETF issuer to publish its custody address and other vital details. Fans and well-meaning Bitcoin owners have been sending BTC to the wallet and don’t seem to be slowing down. There have been over 998,085 Sats, an equivalent of 419 USD, from 35 crypto outflow transactions to the trust’s Bitcoin address as more are expected to come. While the amount is infinitesimal compared to the $511 million of BITB’s assets under management, it comes off as a precursor to greater events in the Bitcoin ETF ecosystem. As expected, questions have begun to arise, with industry leaders and investors looking to know how the donations would be utilized. Bitwise’s management already seemed to have foreseen the need for a transparent plan to utilize such inflows and was swift to let everyone in on how the funds would be distributed. When approached on the issue, Bitwise CEO Matt Hougan said “All assets accrue to the benefit of shareholders of BITB”. The company’s form S-1 already said that inflows of “involuntary assets” would be sold for cash to be shared proportionally among all BITB shareholders. With the advent of sending crypto donations to the new Bitcoin ETF came another fear. OFAC-sanctioned wallets may also send Sats to the address with malicious intent, including dusting attacks. OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) – an arm of the US Treasury Department – uses sanctions to fight against criminal actors abusing crypto and other digital assets. If Bitwise begins receiving BTC from OFAC-sanctioned addresses, the most intuitive expectation is scrutiny of Bitwise’s transactions and possible grapples with regulators. The fears are valid, considering that in 2022, OFAC-sanctioned Tornado Cash targeted 600 wallet addresses in a mammoth dusting attack, sending them 0.1 ETH each, according to Blockchain security company PeckShield. Hong Kim, co-founder and CTO of Bitwise Invest has dissolved such fears, saying that Coinbase Custody will flag any Satoshi inflows from such OFAC-sanctioned addresses and they will not be added to the NAV (Net Asset Value).   Kim also stated that dust transactions are no big deal for an institutional Custodian like Coinbase Custody. He categorically said that the notion of attacking a public Bitcoin address by sending it dust or free sats “doesn’t hold truth”. There are also other micro-regulatory areas being dug up by analysts, such as how to sieve out transfers from addresses that have not completed their KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements. The focal point here is how the SEC may react to a potential mix-up of non-KYC coins in the ETF issuer’s NAV. While we’ve yet to see inquisitions into the donations by the SEC, the recent string of events around BITB are quite suspenseful and seem like the advent of a transparent ETF revolution."
2024-01-27 07:40:32+00:00,"Bitcoin Is In A Critical Juncture, Should You Plan Your Way Out?",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-is-in-a-critical-juncture-should-you-plan-your-way-out/,"The lead to the verdict of Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) until their eventual approval showed a bullish trajectory for the world’s leading cryptocurrency by market cap. However, it turned out that $49K was the top of the mountain as it all went downhill after a “sell the news” event. Now, FUD is going around as the usual Bitcoin bashers are saying that the digital asset is finally losing its grip in the market. As of 4:45 AM UTC this Saturday, Bitcoin is trading around the $41,800 level and over 4% up on the 24-hour chart. Interestingly, the trading volume of the crypto spiked more than 37% during this period as $25.17 billion worth of BTC changed hands between wallets and exchanges. With the current market cap at $820.64 billion, the statistics indicate a 3% volume/market cap ratio for BTC. This metric shows the stability of the asset and the ease of trading it close to its value. The same timeframe saw Bitcoin find a low of $39,902 and a peak of $42,209. The crypto asset is nearly 15% down since it topped in on January 11 this year. One of the key narratives driving negative market sentiments is the continuing Bitcoin dump of Grayscale. At the start of the weekend, the Bitcoin ETF issuer’s massive sell-off had already hit $5 billion as it let go 123,923 BTC. The latest was the 10,923 BTC it moved to Coinbase Prime Deposit to the tune of $449 million. Another event that shills is capitalizing on is the upcoming sale of the US Government of 2,399 BTC. That’s approximately $100 million worth of Bitcoin seized from the Silk Road crackdown. These are pretty staggering figures at present values. But come to think of it, the total of these supplies only makes up 0.64% out of the 19.61 million BTC in circulation. Sure, these dribbles would send ripples into the market, but these are not enough to destabilize or crash it. These figures are not even at par with the sum held by Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy at 189,150 BTC, which is nearly 1% of all Bitcoin we have before the coming halving. That’s not even mentioning whales, including other established institutional powerhouses that are aggressively hoarding its supply like BlackRock and Fidelity using the proceeds of their Bitcoin ETFs and investments in Bitcoin mining firms. If you are paperhanding your way in the current situation, then it probably is over for you. But then again, if you keep your diamond hands in your game, there’s a big chance that you will hit the jackpot as Bitcoin is about to hit a major milestone. We are at a critical juncture for Bitcoin right now as the halving nears. But as history has shown, Bitcoin halvings have never failed to drive a sense of scarcity and more demand for the coin, which in turn have resulted in rising prices. Analysts are super bullish on the upcoming event, and some like Aaron Arnold of Altcoin Daily even predicted Bitcoin’s push to over $100K one-year post-halving. These, however, do not account for any untoward circumstances or hype that may change public sentiment. Nonetheless, it can’t be denied that the after-effects of the affair would be profound."
2024-01-26 19:57:47+00:00,"US Government To Unload Over $130 Million In Seized Bitcoin From Silk Road, Investors Brace For Potential Impact",https://blockzeit.com/us-government-to-unload-over-130-million-in-seized-bitcoin-from-silk-road-investors-brace-for-potential-impact/,"In a recent development, the US government has issued a notice on its plan to sell over 2,933 Bitcoin (BTC) worth over $130 million seized from the now-closed online black market Silk Road.  The notice of forfeiture is in keeping with the US Attorney General’s directive for such disposals, says the document. The US government by the notice, gives 60 days from the publication date (Jan. 10), for any third party claiming interest in the forfeited property to file an ancillary petition. The saga all began in 2018 after a then 32-year-old Ryan Farace pleaded guilty to charges of manufacture and sale of alprazolam tablets a.k.a Xanax for bitcoin via darknet marketplaces. Forensic investigation via cryptocurrency tracing disclosed a total of over 9,138 BTC linked to transfers to Farace or his alias “Xanaxman”. Some of the bitcoins were seized, however Farace claimed he didn’t have any way of accessing the rest of his bitcoin stash. Fast forward to August 2020, Farace who was now incarcerated, conspired with his father Joseph Farace to transfer 2,874 BTC to a third party in a bid to move it to a foreign bank account. Though the transfer went successfully, Federal agents got wind of it and seized all the 2,874 BTC in February of 2021. Later in May of 2021, the Government also seized over 58.74 BTC which was part of Farace’s drug trafficking proceeds. The son was sentenced in January last year to 54 months in federal prison, while the father was sentenced on January 8, 2024, to 19 months in prison and 2 years of supervised release. Another notable character in the story is former Special Agent Sean Bridges, also mentioned in the US government’s forfeiture notice.  Bridges was an investigator in the Silk Road case but got his hands sullied with money laundering involving 3,100 BTC in total and other fiat currency. He seems to be an accomplice to Farace’s last 2,874 BTC transfer with the forfeiture document reading “2874.904256 Bitcoin… seized from Ryan Farace and Sean  Bridges on February 10, 2021…”. Bridges now serves a combined prison sentence of 95 months. The US government’s intention to dispose of the confiscated bitcoins is being analyzed from different perspectives in the crypto industry. Many analysts believe it will have no consequences on Bitcoin’s charts being that it’s not even up to a tenth of the Bitcoin Grayscale has sold since its spot ETF approval. The other side thinks that it’s a subtle strategy By the US government to stir up FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) in the Bitcoin ecosystem for their selfish interests in Bitcoin The US currently holds over 200,000 Bitcoin, according to Forbes, worth over $8 billion at the moment and way more than the bitcoin owned by any other country. Whatever the case, the industry will find out how it plays out after the March 10 ancillary petition deadline."
2024-01-26 11:46:27+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Breaks Below $40,000 As Grayscale & FTX Dump BTC Over $2 Billion",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-breaks-below-40k-after-grayscale-ftx-dump/,"Bitcoin (BTC) price crashed this week after Grayscale took to the markets and dumped a substantial amount of Bitcoin (BTC) worth around $2.14 billion. Bitcoin price dropped to a low of $38,505, below the $40,000 support. The market is uncertain as experts predict the asset could drop further.Let’s find out what the chart is saying. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $40,257 today. This represents a +0.6% price increase in the last 24 hours and a -2.5% price decrease in the past 7 days. Bitcoin dominance is up this week, indicating that BTC gained strength against altcoins. It also indicates that despite it falling in price, altcoins experienced greater losses in comparison. The global crypto market cap also fell from $1.7 trillion to $1.64 trillion in the past week. In last week’s analysis, BTC price was sitting in the demand zone as seen in the above chart. Many traders were expecting a bounce back since there was no reason for the asset to go further down. The demand zone served as a strong support (or not), promising to hold up the price of Bitcoin. However, things took a turn for the worse as Bitcoin price broke below the ‘strong’ support on January 22, 2024, after  According to the #Grayscale website, #Grayscale currently holds 566,973 $BTC($23.21B), decreasing ~52,227 $BTC ($2.14B) since the ETF was passed.And iShares(Blackrock) holds 33,431 $BTC($1.37B), Fidelity holds 24,857 $BTC($1.02B), Bitwise holds 10,152 $BTC($415.6M). pic.twitter.com/fx2Kj3WpSB Grayscale has dumped a total of ~52,227 BTC on the open market since January 12, when the ETF was approved. More information now reveals that Grayscale’s strategic move to sell Bitcoin was in a bid to manage redemptions as investors are leaving GBTC due to its high fees and the shrinking price difference with spot ETFs. Grayscale currently holds a mammoth 566,973 BTC in its reserves, worth about $23.21 billion. If the company decides to continue selling, the price of Bitcoin may not survive the onslaught. Bitcoin breaking below the key support level of $40,000 injects some fear into the market. Currently, BTC is retesting the support, and should it resist the price action, we could see a $38,000 and a $35,000 BTC soon. Bitcoin price is below the 50-day moving average but above the 200-day moving average. If the price goes down, the 200-day (at $35,700) may offer strong support. However, if the bulls want to push BTC up, then they have to make sure the price remains above $40,000.  The 50-day moving average also presents a weak resistance at $41,700.I still maintain my prior prediction of a $33,000 BTC by halving week and a $55,000 BTC by June 2024.

2024-01-25 11:45:08+00:00,Is The Bitcoin Crash Over – A Short Analysis,https://blockzeit.com/is-the-bitcoin-crash-over-a-short-analysis-2/,"The approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETF was a significant event in the cryptocurrency market. It not only made history in the financial sector but also brought a sense of acceptance to the market. Eleven Spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved on January 11, but while this brought excitement to the market, it also brought news of a “sell-off.” The approval spiked the price of Bitcoin to the $49,200 mark, initiating a bull run in the market. However, this bull run was short-lived. The cryptocurrency market has been bleeding, declining from $49,000 to below the $40,000 support level. Since the beginning of the week, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has played a significant role in the Bitcoin sell-off, witnessing substantial outflows that have led to selling pressure in the market. Since January 11, GBTC has sold over $4.4 billion worth of Bitcoin over the past nine trading days. According to BitMex, on Monday, GBTC sold Bitcoin worth $640 million. On January 24th, GBTC recorded an outflow of $429 million, while today, GBTC recorded an outflow of $425 million. This series indicates a decline in outflows, and if the decline in GBTC outflows continues, a bull run might be witnessed. Bitcoin Spot ETF Flow – After 9 dayshere is the provisional chart.

Looks like another net outflow day. https://t.co/fzj2LI5CtH pic.twitter.com/E7s3YjyatD Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas tweeted that GBTC is experiencing a downtrend in Bitcoin outflows, recording an outflow of 106,092 Bitcoins since it was approved as a Bitcoin ETF exchange. GBTC currently holds 550,000 Bitcoins in its store, and so far, it has only sold 106,092 Bitcoins. Although GBTC outflows are declining, we are uncertain about GBTC’s next move. $GBTC outflows today were ‘only’ $425m, lowest bleed since day one and seemingly trending down. That said it’s still a pretty large number. Source: Bloomberg terminal At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading below the $40,000 support level. However, a potential bull run could be witnessed if the Bitcoin market can surpass the $40,500 resistance level. Currently, the market has found new support at $38,200 and $38,500. The market is currently experiencing fluctuating highs and lows at this level, attempting to recover from this new support. If the market experiences a surge in recovery above the $40,500 level, it could rise to $42,500, although the market might encounter significant resistance above the $41,500 mark. GBTC is the primary reason behind the selling pressure, but as we observe the decline in outflows, the market could make a significant surge, leading to a bullish trend."

As of Wednesday’s trading day, both have made up 70% of the flows in their asset class. In an update, Blackrock has already accumulated 44,005 BTC in its coffers to back up its spot Bitcoin ETF. At the present rate of $40K per BTC, this equates to $1.76 billion. JUST IN: 🇺🇸 BlackRock now holds 44,005 #BTC worth over $1.75 billion for their spot #Bitcoin ETF. pic.twitter.com/Fai5WBFNE5 The appeal of the giant asset management firm’s spot Bitcoin ETF can be attributed to its low fees. For the first six months or the initial $5 billion asset under management (AUM), IBIT only charges 0.12%. Beyond any of those conditions will bring up the fees to 0.25%. It should be noted that Blackrock originally had the numbers at 0.20% during the discounted period and 0.30% thereafter. But then again, a master stroke revision by the company hours before the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) mass approval of all spot Bitcoin ETF filings brought the rates down to what they are now. The expense ratio of IBIT matches that of the FBTC. The latter had the charges totally waived for the first six months of their trading, though, to spice up the competition. As of this writing at 5:00 PM UTC, Bitcoin is fighting to keep its footing around the $40K line and it is displaying nearly 2% gain on the 24-hour chart. During this period, the trading volume of the digital asset declined by more than 27% as $24.07 billion worth of BTC moved between wallet addresses and crypto exchanges. The same timeframe saw the crypto’s price hover between a low of $39,105 and a peak of $40,483. With a rounded-off circulating supply of 19.61 million BTC, the market cap of the coin currently sits at $785.84 billion. So far, Bitcoin has lost approximately 18% of its value from the one-month high of $49K it exhibited upon the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US market. The numbers are notably 41% down from the all-time high of $68,789 it achieved within the November 2021 crypto rally. The drop in Bitcoin price was mainly attributed to the “sell the news” event that occurred in the immediate aftermath of the SEC’s go signal for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Rubbing salt into the wound is the massive whale outflows partly influenced by Grayscale’s BTC sell-off in the past few days. The tides are expected to turn by next month when trading for the halving begins."

And unfortunately, it continues to take the rest of the market with it. The price of Bitcoin is continuing to the downside, and it looks like there aren’t any signs of it slowing down. The decline seems persistent, hovering around $38,000-$40,000. This article aims to explain the factors influencing this downturn, particularly for newcomers or those concerned about daily fluctuations in the crypto market. In this article, we are going to discuss why that is happening, how far we can go, and when we might turn around. BREAKING: FTX liquidated $1b of GBTC shares. Thee have been $2.8B of outflows so far – CoinDesk pic.twitter.com/zXEVCxlcY6 As recently reported by my colleague, FTX has dumped 22 million shares of their Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), totaling about $1 billion — that accounts for half of the outflows of the GBTC shares. Under the FTX bankruptcy proceedings, the now-bankrupt exchange was finally able to liquidate those positions because Grayscale’s Bitcoin trust was recently converted into an exchange-traded fund (ETF), prompting them to exit and liquidate their holdings. Read: Breaking News: FTX Dumps $1 Billion Grayscale Bitcoin ETF Now one can add Mt Gox FUD to the mix 🙄 pic.twitter.com/gUKRAZvEKS FTX is not the only bankrupt exchange that is going to continue the downward pressure on the crypto market. Another factor is the Mt. Gox bankruptcy. This defunct exchange still holds about 200,000 Bitcoins, soon to be released to former users. However, the repayment plan is going to be in stages, but this does not necessarily mean that all of these Bitcoins will be flooded onto the market because most of these people might want to hold on and wait until the top of the bull market before they sell. Interestingly, many Mt. Gox users bought Bitcoin at much lower prices (some at $1000), and they might be inclined to sell for a profit. Read: Mt. Gox Creditors Are Finally Getting Their Money Back – Details The U.S. government now possesses $3.6 billion worth of #bitcoin.This is in addition to the $1 billion worth of $BTC they confiscated from Silk Road a few years ago.Wonder what they plan on doing with it? 😏 The US Government is currently in control of 100,000 Bitcoins from their seizures of the Silk Road case. And the last time they announced anything about those seized Bitcoins was way back in July 2023 — currently, we do not have any updates as to their plans for selling those Bitcoins, which could be a potential sources of FUD in the coming months or years. Read: What Do The US Government And Whales Know About Bitcoin That We Don’t? Fortunately, it looks like we do have a bit of a bullish divergence indicated by this higher low on the RSI and a lower low for the Bitcoin price — this could see us having a short-term relief rally that could take us up to a level of support turning it into resistance. However, we still have not played out this bearish flag yet that coincides a price target of roughly $36,000-$34,000. A possibility would be that we will have a slight rally before turning into a bull trap, then continue to the downside. Regardless of the selling pressure and FUD from all these large entities, it is best to acknowledge that the crypto markets do not go up in a straight line forever, and there are going to be retracements and pullbacks along the way, representing opportunities to add to your portfolio and multiply your wealth. What you can surmise from all of this information is that the selling pressure cannot continue forever. Eventually, BlackRock’s inflows and all these other ETFs that people are pouring money into will overpower the selling pressure. And whenever that happens, we are going to go parabolic again."
2024-01-24 08:42:42+00:00,Is Grayscale Manipulating The Bitcoin Market?,https://blockzeit.com/is-grayscale-manipulating-the-bitcoin-market/,"Grayscale has been dumping billions worth of Bitcoin (BTC) into the market for the past eight days. This comes amid the high trading volume experienced by its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Could there be a more nefarious reason behind its move? A couple of hours ago, it was revealed that Grayscale once again dropped tens of thousands worth of Bitcoin, which was equivalent to $515,000,000. This puts its total outflow to $3.97 billion in just eight days. 🚨 JUST IN: Grayscale Sold $515,000,000 in $BTC Today 📉 @Grayscale Update:  📤 GBTC: -$515.3m  📥 Franklin: +$1.1m  📊 Bitwise: +$27m Total outflow hits a staggering $3.97 Billion in just 8 days! 😱👀 What's behind Grayscale's Bitcoin dump? Comment Below… pic.twitter.com/RAa4un6BYE Previously, most of Grayscale’s outflows were attributed to the bankruptcy estate of FTX as investors of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) liquidated around 22 million shares upon their conversion to spot Bitcoin ETF. Analysts claimed the massive dump last Monday could be the end as FTX has presumably depleted its GBTC shares already. It, therefore, comes as a surprise that the crypto asset manager continues to sell off a large chunk of its BTC holdings. Now, the crypto community is none too pleased as the firm’s move is blamed for the added ripples in Bitcoin prices. As BTC continues to tank below the $40K range, conspiracy theories about Grayscale are presently beginning to surface. The whale BTC transactions of Grayscale coupled with the dipping prices of the crypto and all the FUD going around are currently generating plenty of speculations in the market. Conspiracy theories are being floated in an attempt to make sense of what the bigger picture is. These range from the sensical to the absurd. Even so, some of them are just hard to ignore because of their plausibility, given the current state of things. One popular theory is that Grayscale may be trying to manipulate the market. But then again, this begs the simple question, “Why?” Some members of the community suspect that Grayscale may be intentionally tanking the prices to wash out the retail investors. This way, the institution and its Wall Street buddies can buy more as the prices hit a dirt-cheap entry point. Let’s not forget that there’s the Bitcoin halving coming up, which could inflate BTC prices as an all-new level of scarcity for the digital asset is realized. So, buying at the dip will let investors, particularly whales, reap an unprecedented amount of wealth once the coin pops to record-level highs. The abovementioned scenario, however, is just a simplistic analysis of a potential short-term outcome. A long-term HODL of the digital asset and massive accumulation of its supply could mean control of its flow going forward. Either way, these both paint a bleak scenario that might eventually deconstruct the decentralized fabric of Bitcoin, which would ultimately defeat Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision. With that, maybe it’s time to pay more attention to the sound alternatives laid down by altcoins."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."

These financial instruments logged a trading volume of over $14 billion at the start of this week and a huge chunk of these were traced back to heavyweights like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale. Other players like Franklin Templeton, however, were playing catch-up with their powerhouse rivals. Franklin Templeton has been in the business since 1947 and has already accumulated up to $1.53 trillion in assets under management (AUM) from millions of clients in 160 countries. This makes it one of the established players in the realm of asset management. The Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) came in late in the party last year but it was one of the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission on January 10. Yet, only those from the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale were the ones flooded with billions of funds. In fact, the three alone made up around 90% of the overall trading volume of the new asset class. The rest, including Franklin Templeton, had to contend with the scraps left by the remaining 10%. On Monday, EZBC recorded $101 million worth of transactions, which were pretty impressive figures at face value. But then again, if we take into consideration the $14 billion trading volume of spot Bitcoin ETFs during that time, the numbers only made up 0.72% of the total float. Despite lagging behind the big three, Franklin Templeton remains optimistic about its new ETF product. Franklin Templeton Head of Digital Assets Roger Bayston expressed his confidence that their digital investment vehicle will eventually pick up as more investors and financial advisers become more familiar with them. “It’s just a matter of time … as education moves forward about how these assets complement and help deliver potentially better long-term solutions alongside of other assets in their portfolio,” said the exec in an interview with The Block. “You have a brand new product that has never existed before,” Bayston added. “These platforms are doing their fiduciary responsibilities to filter through those providers and find differentiations that end up making sure that their clients have the best long-term results… that’s the process that is occurring right now.” As of this writing at 6:30 AM UTC, Bitcoin is still reeling from the effects of the “sell the news” event that took place upon the approval of its related US spot ETFs. After hitting a one-month low of $38K yesterday, it is now edging closer to recovering the $40K territory as it trades around $39,830. Experts predict that BTC will continue to move on the downside, but there’s hope that it will pop up once the trading for the halving begins next month, which will coincide with the 2024 Super Bowl."
2024-01-23 11:24:08+00:00,"Bitcoin Falls Below The $40,000 Mark Again",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-falls-below-the-40000-mark-again/,"In the volatile world of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, the undisputed leader in the crypto sphere, experienced a drop below the $40,000 mark as of Monday at 7:30 a.m. UCT. While the traditional market saw speculative movements, the cryptocurrency market overall exhibited a bearish trend. This downturn mirrored the events of December 3, when Bitcoin fell below the $40,000 threshold, only to climb to a 20-month high of $49,000 in January. The decline was observed on January 22, with BTC trading at $41,557, indicating a downtrend in the market. The crypto market experienced a 5.6% price decline over the last 48 hours and a 9.7% drop over the past 30 days. On Monday, Bitcoin reached $39,436, its lowest level since December 3, while Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell by 6%, settling the market at $2,300 in the last 24 hours. Market speculation was influenced following a series of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals that began on January 11. The approval of these ETFs boosted the cryptocurrency market, propelling Bitcoin to $49,000. This surge attracted investors such as Blackrock and Grayscale, resulting in an accumulation of $4 billion in assets across nine spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, Bitcoin’s price faced another trend after a sell-news report related to the ETF approval, causing the price of Bitcoin to drop from its all-time high of $49k to below the $40k level. Since $GBTC conversion to #BitcoinETF investors have sold > $2 BillionFTX bankruptcy liquidation has led to > $1 Billion in selling $BTCGBTC discount to NAV arbitrage trade led to > $1 Billion selling to lock in profits.All of that selling in a relatively short time and… pic.twitter.com/e0I0ms3y3D GBTC and FTX played significant roles in the decline of Bitcoin’s price and that of the wider cryptocurrency market. It was noted that Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experienced a substantial outflow of 52,800 bitcoins since its ETF approval on January 11. Moreover, FTX exacerbated market volatility after selling $1 billion worth of GBTC shares. As of January 22, Grayscale has accounted for 15,816 BTC, valued at $643 million, to CoinBase. The year began with a promising shift in the market, pointing towards a bullish trend in the crypto market. However, analysts are forecasting a short-term sell-off, suggesting that Bitcoin could potentially fall to as low as $38,000. Caroline Mauron, CEO of digital-asset derivatives, stated, “While $40,000 might be an important psychological level, we don’t expect a breakthrough to trigger a cascade of liquidations here. We see the next support level around $38,000."
2024-01-23 03:58:19+00:00,Why Is Grayscale Dumping Bitcoin? – All You Need To Know,https://blockzeit.com/why-is-grayscale-dumping-bitcoin/,"The Bitcoin spot ETFs finally went live two weeks ago, but the price of Bitcoin has been on a downward slide since then. And the biggest reason is a company called Grayscale. Wild seeing Grayscale casually dump 10,000-25,000 BTC each day.May end up being the biggest blown lead in the history of #Bitcoin, and all because they refuse to lower fees. pic.twitter.com/JujTljpPtg Grayscale has been dumping Bitcoin on the market to the tune of 10,000 BTC, with the biggest chunk of up to 25,000 BTC in a single day. And all of this is because market participants are theorizing that Grayscale cannot meet the fees similar to the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity.  Investors are currently fleeing from Grayscale in search for other players as other ETF providers like BlackRock already accumulated over $1.3 billion for their Bitcoin spot ETF, which is around 33,000 Bitcoins on their books right now. Back in 2013, there was no way for traditional investors to invest in Bitcoin, so the Grayscale Trust (GBTC) was created. If you bought shares of the trust, Grayscale would use your money to buy Bitcoin. As Bitcoin’s price went up, so would the value of your shares. This worked great until the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and FTX in 2022. Because of the interconnecting agreements between those companies, Grayscale began to destabilize and their investors started to panic. Read: Breaking News: FTX Dumps $1 Billion Grayscale Bitcoin ETF Now, fast forward to two weeks ago, where the eleven Bitcoin spot ETFs were finally approved, Grayscale was one of those providers. But unlike the other ten ETFs, Grayscale already had around 617,000 Bitcoins sitting in their trust. So, when the ETFs launched on the stock exchange, Grayscale’s investors were not out there buying Bitcoin — they were actually selling their old holdings. Even with BlackRock and Fidelity buying over a billion dollars each worth of BTC, the Grayscale ETF was almost entirely sell-side volume, and they were sitting on 4% of the global supply (which is around $30 billion).

Read: What You Need To Know About Bitcoin Spot ETF Fees — Is It Worth It? Many forecasts anticipate a bigger drop, but I am a bit more neutral. The thing is, the other ETF providers manage over $10 trillion in assets. So, if even 0.5% of that converts into Bitcoin, it would send the price soaring. However, that kind of portfolio rebalancing happens slowly — over months, not days. Right now, it does seem that the market weakness is due to Grayscale. However, can we blame Grayscale as they are trying to liquidate their holdings? That is where we have a debate. Some argue on why the company needs to sell because there are a lot of insiders that want to cash out. Another argument says that Barry Silbert, the former CEO of Digital Currency Group (DGC), has an enormous debt to repay due to the Gemini debacle that happened last year. It is also worth noting that Grayscale is dumping as much as they can because they are forced to, as their investors are abandoning their investment products all for the fact that they cannot compete with the low fees being offered on by BlackRock and these other ETF providers. It could be a variety of reasons, or those reasons combined. Whatever the case is, everyone is eyeing on Grayscale as they could be doing this for a long time."
2024-01-22 16:15:16+00:00,Breaking News: FTX Dumps $1 Billion Grayscale Bitcoin ETF,https://blockzeit.com/ftx-dumps-1-billion-grayscale-bitcoin-etf/,"FTX just sold around $1 billion worth of its Grayscale Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETF). Could this have influenced the slump of the digital asset back to the $40K range? Citing “two people familiar with the matter” as sources, Coindesk explained that the ginormous outflow as of late was due to the huge sell-off triggered by investors dumping over $2 billion worth of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares into the market. This series of transactions started on January 11 after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlit its conversion into a spot Bitcoin ETF. A major portion of these were traced from the bankruptcy estate of FTX. The report said it was responsible for the outflow of 22 million Grayscale Bitcoin ETF stakes. The outflow experienced by Grayscale since the approval of its spot Bitcoin ETF conversion is surprisingly the opposite of what its rivals in the market have been experiencing. BlackRock in particular has already surpassed $1 billion in assets under management (AUM) for these financial instruments last week, which was barely two weeks after the SEC’s go signal. But then again, Grayscale has been in the market in the form of GBTC where it already accumulated $30 of assets prior to its conversion and the arrival of its competitors. As of this writing at 4:00 PM UTC, Bitcoin is trading at $40,486, which shows a drop of 2.65% on the 24-hour chart. The trading volume for the digital asset is up by a whopping 121% as $21.55 billion worth of BTC moved between wallets and crypto exchanges. This indicates massive selling pressure for the coin during the timeframe as it hovered between a low of $40,364 and a high of $41,768. The present valuation for BTC is significantly down from the $49K spike it reached on the way to the SEC’s endorsement of its related spot ETFs. The slump has been heavily blamed on a “sell the news” event occurring upon the arrival of the regulator’s verdict. The source thinks that FTX has already depleted its GBTC shares, so the market could ease up following its last liquidation. Let’s not forget that there’s the Bitcoin halving coming up as early as April, which could turn the tide when people will start trading the event by next month, just in time for the 2024 Super Bowl."
2024-01-19 10:44:36+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Manipulation Sends Price Back to $40,000, What Next?",https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-price-manipulation-sends-price-back-to-40000/,"Bitcoin price experienced a rather unexpected drop this week after the ETF approval and trading news was priced in. BTC did touch a high of $49,048 but after that went ahead to drop back to lows of $40,000. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $41,267 today. This represents a -3.5% price decrease in the last 24 hours and a -9.8% price decrease in the past 7 days. Bitcoin dominance is down from 48.8% last week, signifying that the majority of investors have sold their BTC holdings and put the money in altcoins. A drop in BTC dominance is a good indicator that altcoins are set to do well. The drop in dominance was accompanied by a drop in the market cap of the asset. However, Bitcoin’s overall trading volume across different exchanges went up by +39.80%. Falling price coupled with rising volume is usually an indicator of accumulation. Bitcoin price is poised to head upwards in the near future. Last week, Bitcoin price remained clean above the consolidation zone where it had spent several weeks prior. All indicators showed the asset was headed for higher highs. However, market makers may have had other plans as the price of BTC came tumbling down back into the range. While we at Blockzeit anticipated a $53,000 BTC after it touched $49,000, Bitcoin came down and broke through the supply zone of the consolidation zone. The theory that smart money may be behind this price manipulation sounds plausible especially when Blackrock is seen to have added their Bitcoin holding to a whopping 16,362 BTC in just 4 trading days. Are they trying to get cheap Bitcoin? Maybe. In the aftermath of the ETF approval and market reaction to the news, it was clear that the whole operation was a liquidity hunt stunt by smart money. The huge pump higher that left the entire market euphoric served to add more liquidity into the pockets of the market makers.  Bitcoin bulls have lost more than $217 million in liquidations as BTC sales by Grayscale continue. Moving on to the chart, Bitcoin is sitting at its prior demand zone – this is where a majority of buy limit orders are sitting. If market makers choose to play into the traders’ plans, they will trigger the buy limit orders and push the BTC price higher before crashing it back down. The current demand zone serves as a strong support zone since it has been tested severally before. However, a black swan could easily cause the price to slice through. In that case, BTC can find further support at $37,000, and $35,000. Below this, it’s $31,000 and $24,000.

Bitcoin is clocking in at $27.5 billion at the time of this writing. Silver is currently at $11.5 billion. It is also worth noting that the Bitcoin spot ETF beat the Gold ETF in volume last week.

This means there is a whole lot of demand for these Bitcoin spot ETFs by traditional and accredited investors, hedge funds, and by people with money. And also, we are starting to see a lot of these traditional finance firms ramp up their marketing strategies — we have seen a lot of Bitcoin ETF commercials even before the approval of the ETFs, and investment firms are continuing to advertise their product with competitive fees to attract clients and make the most of those benefits. Read: More Spot Bitcoin ETF Ads Rolled Out Basically all this means is that demand for the Bitcoin spot ETF will continue to grow based on previous trends that we have seen in the past. But the difference between Bitcoin, Gold and Silver, is that Bitcoin is actually a very scarce asset. When we are talking about Gold or Silver, we do not really know how much has not been mined in the world. But when we are talking about Bitcoin, it is common knowledge that there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin ever created. Additionally, basic economics indicates that the scarce supply of something could indicate a higher value for it because it is harder to obtain. However, we still have people like Jamie Dimon bashing Bitcoin publicly, and we are going to see a lot of other companies continue to do so. Read: JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon: Governments Should Shut Down Bitcoin & Crypto – Details It is possible that we could see Bitcoin’s market cap reach or even surpass the hights of Gold.

2024-01-17 12:03:09+00:00,Marathon Digital Announces Completion Of Two Bitcoin Mining Site Acquisitions,https://blockzeit.com/marathon-digital-completes-two-bitcoin-mining-site-acquisitions/,"As the smoke gradually cleared from the launch of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, their industrywide implications are now being felt, especially by Bitcoin miners. The arrival of these proxy Bitcoin instruments drove investors away from BTC mining firms like Marathon Digital (MARA). It was made worse by the “sell the news” event that took effect in the wake of the spot ETFs’ official approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Marathon Digital remains unfazed by these, however, as it went on with its initial plan of acquiring two additional Bitcoin mining sites. According to the company’s official release a couple of hours ago, it just finalized the takeover of the two Bitcoin mining plants it announced earlier. The operational facilities bought from Generate Capital to the tune of $178.6 million are located in Granbury, Texas, and Kearney, Nebraska. “With the closing of this acquisition, we have officially made the transition to a more sophisticated organization with a diversified portfolio of Bitcoin mining assets,” said Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel. The acquisition adds 390 megawatts (MW) to the capacity of Marathon Digital to pump up its total Bitcoin mining capability to 910 MW within the next two years. The procurement also raises the company’s stake, which now gives it 45% control over its direction. Furthermore, it will allow the business to scale up its generation to 50 exahashes per second (EH/s) while reducing its operational costs by 30%. “This transaction demonstrates Generate’s strong operational capabilities, and we are excited for Marathon to take over stewardship of the Kearney and Granbury data centers, which are some of the most efficient data centers and largest controllable load resource assets in the North America,” stated Generate Capital Principal David Hirsh. “Marathon is well placed to fully realize the potential of these assets for their stakeholders.” As of yesterday’s close, Marathon Digital’s stock was down by 6.32% to $17.78. Its pre-market price remains close to that level as it was only nudged by 0.56% as of 6:40 AM EST (11:40 AM UTC). Marathon Digital’s current value has significantly dipped after showing strong gains during the last Santa Claus rally. It surged $31.07 post-Christmas last month and traded sideways during the massive sell-off that followed. But then again, the downward momentum continued following the historic approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US by the SEC. Zooming out the chart, however, displays over a 112% increase in its price. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is still trading at $42,660 as of press time, showing subtle movements within the 24-hour frame between a low of $42,086 and a high of $43,566."
2024-01-17 05:25:17+00:00,Bitcoin Expected To Dive At $40K,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-expected-to-dive-at-40k/,"Bitcoin (BTC) quickly rose in the past few months as the anticipation of the approval of its related spot exchange traded funds (ETFs) built up. When the big official announcement came from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), however, its momentum quickly dissipated when it failed to reach the 50s and hundreds of thousands as some people preached. It turned out that conservative estimates were, in fact, the closest to reality as the super bullish expectations were dashed by the combination of a premature social media announcement and a “sell the news” event. Now, the consensus is looking at a bearish scenario where the digital asset could dive to $40K. The devil was in the details as the countdown ticked to zero. BTC price surged during the Ber months from $25K to above $40K. This made some analysts suspect that it may be a “buy the rumor” event heading to a “sell the news” scenario while others claimed that the price of the spot Bitcoin ETFs may have already been priced in the charts. Is the #BitcoinETF priced in already?#Bitcoin Fast forward to a week after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC, and the contrarian views have been proven right. Since BTC tapped the $49K range in some exchanges last week, it has been on a steady decline going as low as $41,500. As shown in the chart here, things have been getting uglier and they could get worse, so brace yourselves. Experts are now saying that it could further dip to $40K. 10x Research headed by Markus Thielen even noted to its clients that the correction could find a dynamic support level of $38,000 as signaled by RSI divergence. $BTC's pullback from $49K has legs, and prices could drop further to $38k in the next three to four weeks, according to @10x_Research. Reports @godbole17.https://t.co/xHmhvN2sYm This outlook was echoed by FxPro analyst Alex Kuptsikevich. The market expert claimed that a $40K retracement is just “within bounds of typical corrections.” These are nothing but short-term happenings in the world of Bitcoin though. Analysts project a rise following the steep correction. A few hours ago, Thielen said good news is about to come just in time for the Super Bowl 2024. During that time, Bitcoin may finally start trading for the halving. So, until then, let’s distract our “paper hands” with the much anticipated sporting event of the year because good rewards are coming for the “diamond hands.” $BTC's pullback from $49K has legs, and prices could drop further to $38k in the next three to four weeks, according to @10x_Research. Reports @godbole17.https://t.co/xHmhvN2sYm As of this writing at 4:30 AM UTC, Bitcoin is trading at $42.81K, which only moved between $42,086 and $43,566 on the 24-hour chart. Trading volume is up by over 10% within that period though as around $23.97 billion BTC moved between wallet addresses."
2024-01-16 20:12:00+00:00,Arthur Hayes: Bitcoin ETFs Could Bridge Billions Of Dollars From TradFi,https://blockzeit.com/arthur-hayes-on-bitcoin-etfs-and-tradfi/,"Maelstrom CIO and former Bitmex CEO Arthur Hayes believes the arrival of Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (EFTs) could be the catalyst needed to open more trading venues, which could attract billions of dollars in capital from the traditional finance (TradFi) markets. A new blog post from the prominent Bitcoiner and early adopter of the digital asset stated the approval of spot Bitcoin ETF trading in the US will allow more people to partake in the BTC ecosystem. From there, they could have the opportunity to earn based on the difference in fluctuations of the coin at US benchmarks. “Bitcoin is a global market, and price discovery happens primarily on Binance (I guess based in Abu Dhabi),” wrote Hayes. “For the first time in a long time, the Bitcoin markets will have a predictable and long-lasting arbitrage opportunity.” “Hopefully, billions of dollars of flow will be concentrated in an hour-long period on exchanges that are less liquid and price followers of their larger Eastern competitors,” the cryptocurrency personality went on. “I expect there to be juicy spot arbitrage opportunities available.” Hayes also brought up how Hong Kong is likewise gearing up to offer its own spot ETF products based on Bitcoin. He expects their services to be rendered at a “China southbound flow.” “Whatever happens in New York and Hong Kong, neither city will allow fund managers to trade Bitcoin at the best price, but they may only trade on ‘select’ exchanges,” Hayes noted. “This unnatural state of play only serves to create more market inefficiencies from which we, as arbitrageurs, can profit.” Other interesting solutions pushed by Hayes’ article were the prospects of ETF-based financing and Bitcoin for ETF swaps. These, he explained, could pave the way to the realization of a true end-to-end Bitcoin economy. Hayes pointed out that it’s currently very difficult to borrow fiat with Bitcoin collateral. On the other hand, TradFi is no stranger to lending against liquid ETFs. “Getting competitively priced fiat loans in large size will now be possible as long as you pledge Bitcoin ETF shares,” he claimed. “The problem for those who believe in financial freedom is maintaining control of one’s Bitcoin and taking advantage of this cheaper capital.” Thus, Hayes proposed, “The solution to this problem is a Bitcoin for ETF swap.” To illustrate how this would work, he said, “APs who can borrow in the interbank market will create ETF shares and hedge out the Bitcoin/USD price risk.” “This is the create-to-lend business,” he added. “In delta-one speak, it’s the repo value of the ETF shares.” Arthur Hayes, being the visionary that he is, surely presents a pretty exciting future scenario not only in the future of Bitcoin but also in the future of finance. He, however, previously warned that the road toward these realizations could be bumpy. Despite his confidence that BTC may one day reclaim or even surpass its all-time high prices above $60K, he sees the digital asset entering into a correction between 30% to 40% by March. With this, it will be a “no-trade zone” for him now until April to manage risks."
2024-01-15 10:51:11+00:00,BlackRock Goes All-In For The IBIT Spot Bitcoin ETF On Its Website And New Ad,https://blockzeit.com/blackrock-ibit-spot-bitcoin-etf/,"Considering how much money has been flowing since the launch of its new iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (exchange-traded fund), BlackRock just made it the focal point of its official website. The world’s largest asset management also rolled out a new infomercial for the new crypto-based financial instrument. As reported earlier, BlackRock just accumulated 11,439 BTC worth $497 million during the first two days of spot Bitcoin ETF trading in the US. With that kind of money it’s making, it comes as no surprise that the company is now making iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) the highlight of its official website. Two days after the announcement of the US SEC, #BlackRock has already accumulated 11,439 BTC worth over $497 million for its spot #BitcoinETF.https://t.co/GFoadvzp3U The slogan of the campaign centers on how it makes Bitcoin access is made easy via a familiar and commonly traded investment vehicle, an ETF. Complementing the push of BlackRock in the new niche of the US market is a new ad promoting the features of IBIT. Jay Jacobs, the company’s US Head of Thematics and Alternative ETFs, explains in the infomercial the implications of their spot Bitcoin ETF in the future of finance. @iShares #IBIT ETF marks an exciting step in financial innovation, making it possible to get #bitcoin exposure in your traditional brokerage accounts, alongside stocks, bonds, and other ETFs. Why is this such a big deal? Check out our video below. pic.twitter.com/TxqwTyaRHa First of all, the platform lets investors access Bitcoin within a traditional brokerage account. This keeps them out of the complexities associated with setting up and managing cryptocurrency wallets or entrusting their assets to crypto exchanges. Another advantage offered by IBIT is convenience. Customers are freed of the burden of holding their Bitcoin directly. It also exempts them from the costly BTC transaction fees and tax reporting requirements of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Furthermore, it leverages BlackRock’s status as the world’s largest asset management firm. The institution has been in the industry since 1988 and has grown into a powerhouse with $9.1 trillion of assets under management (AUM) as of its Q3 2023 report. Despite BlackRock’s success in the aftermath of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the new asset class was surprisingly met with resistance by Vanguard. The Vanguard Group happens to be the 9.04% owner of BlackRock based on Capital.com. Hours during the countdown of the game-changing moment in Wall Street, Vanguard’s spokesperson fired up a series of rants against spot Bitcoin ETFs. The representative pointed out the weak investment case and lack of intrinsic value of these new assets. The company’s mouthpiece emphasized the high volatility of the cryptos they are related to in questioning their capability to generate real returns. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, however, displayed his confidence in their new product, piping it as a “digital gold.” Moreover, he hyped it as having great potential to be a long-term hedge against the economic uncertainty stirred by the government."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2024-01-15 08:58:58+00:00,How Much Does BlackRock Have For Its Spot Bitcoin ETF?,https://blockzeit.com/how-much-does-blackrock-have-for-its-spot-bitcoin-etf/,"BlackRock is undoubtedly the biggest player to enter the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem. This was very evident when its announcement for spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) filing immediately set the wheels in motion for another bull run in the cryptocurrency space. So, how much of its BTC haul has the world’s largest asset management firm allotted for these hottest new financial instruments on Wall Street today? Just two days following the historic announcement of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last Wednesday, BlackRock has already accumulated 11,439 BTC worth over $497 million for its spot Bitcoin ETF. This contributed to the overall $7.6 billion trading volume experienced by these new financial instruments last week. The influx of spot Bitcoin ETF transactions was apparently undeterred by the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) made by Vanguard when it blocked the trading of these assets in its platform. Prior to that, it made a sweeping statement about having no interest in offering any other crypto-related products. To add insult to injury, a spokesperson of the $7.7 trillion asset management called them “weak” as investment mediums. The mouthpiece of Vanguard also claimed they “lack intrinsic economic value.” “Vanguard believes that the investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak,” said the company representative to Blockworks. “Unlike stocks and bonds, most crypto assets lack intrinsic economic value and generate no cash flows.” “And cryptocurrencies’ high volatility runs counter to our goal of helping investors generate positive real returns over the long term,” the spokesperson added. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, however, has continued to fuel the hype train for spot Bitcoin ETFs in recent interviews. In a stark contrast to his earlier comment against BTC, referring to it as “an index of money laundering,” the company’s head honcho is now telling people, “It’s like digital gold.” “If you’re fearful of your government, or worrying your government is devaluing the currency, then you could see this as a great potential long-term store of value,” Fink commented via an interview with Fox Business. It remains to be seen how spot Bitcoin ETFs, especially the one from BlackRock, will continue to perform as there is apparently a “sell the news” event going on in the market in the aftermath of their approval by the SEC. As of this trading hour, Bitcoin remains unmoving in the $42,700 territory in the 24-hour chart of CoinMarketCap. Trading volume, however, shows a 20% surge as $20.044 billion BTC moved between wallet addresses within the same frame. During that time, the digital asset hovered between a low of $41,705 and a high of $43,065."
2024-01-15 06:22:36+00:00,MicroStrategy Chair Michael Saylor Posts Strong Warning To Bitcoin Holders,https://blockzeit.com/microstrategy-chair-michael-saylor-cautions-bitcoin-holders/,"MicroStrategy founder and chairman Michael Saylor once again addressed the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) deepfakes featuring him. He revealed that his team is now working to take down these videos aimed at Bitcoin (BTC) holders. ⚠️ Warning ⚠️ There is no risk-free way to double your #bitcoin, and @MicroStrategy doesn't give away $BTC to those who scan a barcode. My team takes down about 80 fake AI-generated @YouTube videos every day, but the scammers keep launching more. Don't trust, verify. pic.twitter.com/gqZkQW02Ji During the Christmas season, we reported a video circulating on YouTube featuring Saylor who was encouraging viewers to double their Bitcoin holdings by following the “easy steps” he enumerated. It included scanning a QR code to proceed with the transaction. Something was definitely off in the presentation though, because the lip movements of Saylor’s likeness appeared to be unnatural. His head and eye motions seemed to be in a loop, too, while his head looked like it had been wedged in a static body. The video was eventually taken down after a few days. We don’t know the number of people who have fallen victim to the bait, but it should be noted that it was not an isolated incident. According to the recent post of Saylor via the X platform, his team has been working tirelessly to take down these AI deepfakes that have been looking to scam Bitcoin holders. He said his group removes around 80 of these daily on YouTube. However, these weren’t enough to deter the scammers from producing more. Saylor cleared out that there is no risk-free way of doubling anyone’s Bitcoin. He added that MicroStrategy is not giving away BTC to anyone who simply scans a barcode from a video. The Bitcoin advocate advised people not to trust just about anything they see online and that they should exercise due diligence in verifying ads that may affect their finances. In response to these, some people urged Saylor to hold YouTube accountable for its failure to abide by its own terms and conditions. Meanwhile, others harshly commented that those who easily fall prey to these deepfakes probably deserve what’s coming to them so they can learn their lesson. ⚠️Warning⚠️ My security team has been taking down one AI generated deepfake video featuring me, @MicroStrategy, and #Bitcoin trading & giveaway scams on @YouTube every 15 minutes. Be careful out there, and remember there is no such thing as a free lunch. pic.twitter.com/KpklvOxtlH Saylor is easily the best subject for scams involving Bitcoin because of his strong influence in the tech industry and strong support for the digital asset itself. One does not have to go too far to find out his strong conviction in Bitcoin because it just takes checking out his X account to see that most of his recent posts have been all about the cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition further reflects how Saylor and his company are super bullish about it. Based on its latest disclosure, the tech firm already holds a sum of 189,150 BTC after adding 14,620 BTC to its coffers on December 27, 2023. The overall Bitcoin purchases of the company now lie at $5.9 billion at an average price of $31,168 per BTC. At current prices of $42,700 as of this writing, this equates to $8.076 billion."
2024-01-14 07:08:23+00:00,Arthur Hayes Warns Of A Federal Rug Pull And Dip In Bitcoin Prices,https://blockzeit.com/arthur-hayes-warns-of-federal-rug-pull-and-dip-in-bitcoin-prices/,"Cryptocurrency prices suddenly dipped over the weekend just days following the much-hyped approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin, the reference point of the crypto market’s health, surged to $49K on certain exchanges in the immediate aftermath of the historic announcement only to wash out all its momentum yesterday as it struggled to maintain $42K. A new blog post by former Bitmex CEO Arthur Hayes recently provided some sense as to where the market may be heading next. Prior to the SEC’s nod, Hayes has been very critical of the bad side of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the long run. His primary concern lay in the aggressive accumulation of financial institutions like BlackRock of BTC to power up their spot ETFs. He pointed out that too much success of these new assets could “completely destroy Bitcoin.” The investor predicted a major correction coming in March that would pull BTC prices down by 30% to 40% should the digital gold reclaim the $60K highs. He revealed that he will not buy the digital asset until that month’s decision dates have passed. “I am preparing for a vicious washout of all the crypto tourists in March of this year,” Hayes wrote. He added that now until April will be a “no-trade zone” for him to mitigate risks. Hayes also stated Bitcoin price could still dip between 20% to 30% because of a “dollar liquidity rug pull” even without it reaching its all-time high this quarter. But then again, the values could rebound once the Federal Reserve reprimes its money printers. For the crypto personality, Bitcoin represents a neutral hard currency out of control of the banking system. As of this writing at 6:30 AM UTC on Sunday, Bitcoin’s price has shown very little movement as it went between a $42,517 low and a $43,234 high on the 24-hour charts. The digital asset now sits at $42,866, which is 0.4% below the previous day’s trading. Transaction fell by 62%, too, as only $16.94 billion worth of BTC moved between wallet addresses within the timeframe. This puts its volume-to-market cap ratio at 2.13%. The take of Hayes in his latest post should help balance out the over-optimism of the market in the wake of the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals. However, there is no telling how other narratives could play out in the days to come as we gradually proceed closer to the halving and how other crucial events could shape future hype. As always, balance things out with your due diligence because these forward-looking statements are not indicative of the overall health of the market and they don’t reflect whatever updates may be brewing in the near future."
2024-01-13 14:08:02+00:00,BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Breaks Silence: Bitcoin Is Bigger Than Any Government,https://blockzeit.com/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-breaks-silence-bitcoin-is-bigger-than-any-government/,"In a recent interview with FoxBusiness, Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO, has dropped some nuggets on his thoughts on Bitcoin. This follows the SEC’s approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs on Jan. 10 after a long decade of waiting. In the interview with Fox’s Charlie Gasparino, Fink delved into different topics, including the general US economy and Bitcoin post-ETF approval. Upon delving into Bitcoin, Gasparino wanted to ascertain whether Fink significantly influenced SEC Chief Gensler’s approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs.  “Let’s get to Bitcoin…this is a huge thing. I mean, I see it as the minute Larry Fink put his imprimatur on this, he was going to go through. You don’t have to take credit for it…Is it you that pushed for this? Because Gensler hates it, and they’ve been dragging their feet on it for a bit over a year?” asked Gasparino The billion-dollar mogul then replied that Gensler’s stance on Bitcoin being one of the channels of criminal activity is undeniable. However, Fink himself has made some significant adjustments to his secondary views on Bitcoin and believes it presents a lot of opportunity and is a good store of value. “I did believe, and this is Gary’s position, that it’s still one of the vehicles for illicit activity; I think no one can deny that. Where I came around to it, and I came around to a different interpretation three years ago – that there’s a lot of merit to it. There is a lot of opportunity, it is a great store, and this is where you can debate, it’s a good store of value.” In 2017, Fink seemed more stiff-necked and critical with his views about Bitcoin having no better use case or value besides money laundering.  “Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world.That’s all it is,” said Fink. Bitcoin is still being very vocally criticised as a vehicle for terrorism and money laundering by some influential figures like JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, Elizabeth Warren, SEC Chief Gary Gensler, and a host of others. Fink seems to have a more balanced perspective on Bitcoin this time around. He further discusses how Bitcoin has become a juggernaut that defies governments and sets up citizens against currency devaluation and inflation. “If you’re in a country where you’re fearful of your government, and maybe this is one of the reasons why China has banned it… If you’re in a country where you’re fearful for your future, fearful of your government, or you’re frightened that your government is devaluing its currency… you could say this a great potential long-term store of value and, as I said, it’s like digital gold,” said Fink. “It is a ledger, but it’s an international ledger,” he adds. “It’s cross-border. It’s bigger than any government.”"
2024-01-13 06:03:37+00:00,Is Bitcoin Heading For The Dip Before The Rip?,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-the-dip-before-the-rip/,"The much-anticipated approval of the spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the US finally happened. It didn’t come without a hiccup hours before their announcement though and hopes were dashed as the premier cryptocurrency by market cap went all the way up to $49K only to come crashing back down in the $42K range this weekend. So, the question is, “What now?” As of press time at 5:00 AM this Saturday, Bitcoin is 6.7% down as it hovers around the $43,830 line on the 24-hour chart. Its trading volume appears to be stale, too, with just a bump of 0.89% within the period as only $44.51 billion worth of BTC moved between wallet addresses. The numbers indicate a volume-to-market cap ratio of 5.31% for the cryptocurrency after it drifted between a low of $41,903 and a high of $46,353 within the period. The figures are a stark contrast to the ones displayed on Wednesday as optimism ran high for the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs before the eventual official announcement. Unhindered by the hullabaloos caused by the earlier hacking incident, Bitcoin pumped all the way to $49,048 on BitStamp following the historic nod of the regulator. The torrent of spot Bitcoin ETF transactions in the US immediately brought in $7.6 billion in trading volume in two days. Being the biggest player in this new segment of the market, BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink primed up the new financial instrument to attract more investors. JUST IN: Spot #Bitcoin ETF trading volume surpasses $7.6 billion in its first two days. “If you’re fearful of your government, or worrying your government is devaluing the currency, then you could see this as a great potential long-term store of value,” said the asset investment management firm’s head honcho in an interview with Fox Business. “It’s like digital gold.” Popular X (formerly Twitter) crypto personality Ali (@ali_charts) warned that the Bitcoin charts may get uglier in the next four weekly candles before resuming the uptrend. In other words, investors must HODL (Hold On for Dear Life) despite the dip to experience the rip. This weekly #Bitcoin candlestick is looking uglier by the minute! Remember, the TD presents a sell signal anticipating a one to four weekly candlesticks correction before $BTC resumes the uptrend. https://t.co/fOtoU4JQCZ pic.twitter.com/ZdjpE2PJbr Another pseudonymous crypto analyst going by the alias Coin Signals (@CoinSignals_) on the social media platform believes BTC will continue its upward momentum back to the $49K territory because no “Sell” signal exists. It also cites the bearish rant of Jim Cramer, which could turn out to be the opposite by virtue of the Inverse Cramer phenomenon, to spice up its bullish assessment. There is no TD 9 sell signal on weekly pic.twitter.com/8tY29wtnqN Notwithstanding the technical charts, the stampede of the bulls may be far from over. Amid the underwhelming response of Bitcoin values in the entry of its related spot ETF in the US, we still have the halving coming up, which could further tighten the supply of BTC while driving up its demand."
2024-01-12 07:43:34+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Hits $49,000 As All 11 ETF Applications Receive Approval",https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-price-hits-49000-as-all-11-etf-applications-receive-approval/,"Bitcoin price skyrocketed this week and touched a high of $49,048 on BitStamp when all 11 spot Bitcoin ETF applications received approval and began trading live. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $46,191.74 today. This represents a 0.14% price increase in the last 24 hours and a 5.74% price increase in the past 7 days. Bitcoin market cap rose this week and is only $98 billion shy of hitting the $1 trillion market cap. The recent rise in Bitcoin price caused the asset to surpass Tesla, Meta, and Berkshire Hathaway in market cap ranking. Bitcoin dominance has reduced from last week’s 49.1% as the price of Ethereum skyrocketed to over $2600 on ETF approval news. Last week, we saw Bitcoin enter into a ranging pattern. The market was uncertain how long the ranging would continue but many were optimistic of a bullish breakout if the ETFs got approved on January 10, 2024. If a Bitcoin ETF got approved, BTC would rise as high as $48,000 to $50,000. Bitcoin price aggressively pushed up on January 11, 2024, after the first spot Bitcoin ETF trading went live. Bitcoin rose by 7.64% in less than an hour, touching a high of 49,048. After the buying pressure subsided, BTC dropped back to the $45,000 area and currently sits at $46,000. Despite the aggressive move upwards, BTC RSI(14) is still below the overbought area, giving bullish sentiment vibes.  Once the RSI crosses above the 70 level, the underlying asset is considered overbought. At the same time, the overbought region is characterized by massive FOMO in the market and excessive buy momentum. The RSI crossing into these levels is likely to be tied to Bitcoin prices above $50,000.  In the above chart, the crossing of the RSI above the 70 level was characterized by a steep increase in Bitcoin’s price both times. If another swing up like that were to happen, Bitcoin could likely touch $55,000 easily.

2024-01-11 13:23:46+00:00,SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce Celebrates American Investors’ Right To Trade Spot Bitcoin ETFs After Decade-Long Regulatory Resistance,https://blockzeit.com/sec-commissioner-pierce-on-spot-bitcoin-etfs/,"Yesterday was a red letter day for Bitcoin and the entire crypto community, as the SEC finally approved the long-awaited spot bitcoin ETFs. After the Commission’s recent fake tweet which sent hopeful fans and product issuers into a frenzy, the industry is finally abuzz again with excitement. Following the groundbreaking development, SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce has come upfront with her unbiased thoughts on the historical milestone. Pierce released a statement on the SEC’s official website in which she captured her thoughts on the SEC’s decade-long tussle with institutions and investors. As a background, In 2013, Gemini exchange co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss filed the first-ever spot bitcoin ETF application with the SEC. The application was later rejected in 2017 with the Regulator citing proneness of the market to fraudulence and manipulation. Fast forward to yesterday, bitcoin spot ETFs are approved and set to begin trading today. In 2022, the SEC approved the trading of Bitcoin Futures ETFs under the 1933 Act, which was an obvious bias against Spot Products, given that “These futures-based products are more complex and more difficult to manage than the spot product, which can translate into higher costs for investors” according to Pierce. “In any case, the Commission’s basis for letting these products trade should have been an equally compelling basis for letting spot products trade: the correlation between the bitcoin futures prices and the spot prices is high, which means that the regulated futures market is as relevant for a product based on spot bitcoin as it is for a fund investing in bitcoin futures. But, until a court reminded us that our “unexplained discounting of the obvious financial and mathematical relationship between the spot and futures markets falls short of the standard for reasoned decisionmaking,”[6] we persisted in denying a spot bitcoin ETP,” added Pierce. Pierce ended her 14-paragraph statement by “celebrating the right of American investors to express their thoughts on bitcoin by buying and selling spot bitcoin ETPs” and “celebrating the perseverance of market participants in trying to bring to market a product they think investors want.” The Commissioner also gave a thumbs up to applicants for their unflinching perseverance throughout the Commission’s unnecessary hindrances. BTC rode up to over $47.5K within 2 hours of the spot ETF approval news before descending gradually to $45.7K 7 hours later. The gold of crypto has taken off again and is currently at a healthy $46.9K in what looks like a warm-up for an upward trend."
2024-01-10 22:32:05+00:00,Breaking News: US SEC Finally Approves 11 Spot Bitcoin ETFs,https://blockzeit.com/us-sec-approves-spot-bitcoin-etfs/,"All signs were there: the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) setting hard deadlines, the spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange traded fund (ETF) applicants rushing to iron out any issues with their S-1 forms, ads from some companies, listings in exchanges, a hacker jumping the gun, and more. Now, the regulator has finally approved all spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, the cryptocurrency asset they are based on seemed to be nudged only a bit. After a long wait, the US SEC has finally approved not one but 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs. This means investors within its jurisdiction can start trading with these new financial instruments by Thursday in their designated exchanges. The spot Bitcoin ETF filings greenlit by the SEC were from the following: As of this writing at 10:30 PM UTC, Bitcoin only moved up by over 1% in the 24-hour chart to around $46,500 an hour after the landmark announcement. Trading volume, however, jumped to 19% as around $46.50 billion worth of BTC moved between wallets and exchanges during the period. Along the way, the digital asset moved from a low of $44,483 to $46,686. As some analysts have predicted, the spot Bitcoin ETF approval has already been priced in. This was also evident in the movement of the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap in the course of the botched announcement yesterday that the SEC attributed to a hacker. During that time, the digital gold peaked at nearly $48K at the height of the false post on the regulator’s official X account and dipped to $45K when the fraud was exposed. 📊 Poll Results Are In! 🚀Almost evenly split opinions among our followers:➡️ 46% believe the Bitcoin ETF is already factored into the current price ➡️ 54% think it's not yet reflected in Bitcoin's value What does this mean for BTC's future? Share your thoughts!… https://t.co/tYuh6yZ7Vs As I’ve noted earlier, the whole hacking affair already gave us a dry run of what to expect from Bitcoin in the immediate aftermath of its spot ETF verdict. But then again, this kneejerk reaction is not reflective of the long-term impact of these new financial instruments, which we are very bullish of. Could this also be a dry run to test the initial pump of #Bitcoin upon approval of the spot #BitcoinETFs and how much it will dump after a rejection by the #SEC? https://t.co/QEY83Yo7ow This could also be a confirmation that the halving will be the prime mover of Bitcoin’s value going forward since trading the exchange traded products (ETP) does not really move the digital asset itself. They are proxies of the real thing to give investors an alternative way to trade based on the price movements of BTC. It should be noted though that the growing anticipation for the spot Bitcoin ETFs helped drive the price of the crypto asset by more than 70% in the past few months."
2024-01-10 13:07:28+00:00,Breaking News: BlackRock Slashes Spot Bitcoin ETF Fee to 0.25%,https://blockzeit.com/breaking-news-blackrock-slashes-spot-bitcoin-etf-fee-to-0-25/,"BlackRock is slashing down its proposed spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange traded fund (ETF) fee in yet another revision to its filing under review by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This comes just hours before the anticipated ruling of the regulator on at least one pending application for these new financial instruments. JUST IN: BlackRock cuts its spot #Bitcoin ETF fee to 0.25%. BlackRock is considered to be one of the primary catalysts of the bull run we are experiencing. Its filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF last year turned things around in the ailing industry marred by crashing crypto prices and scandals caused by the collapse of powerhouse crypto entities like FTX, Terra Luna, and others. Given its huge role as a market mover, all eyes have been closely watching its every move, especially now that we are approaching a critical juncture in the future of finance. Yesterday, we reported about the world’s largest asset management firm submitting a revision for its S-1 form. However, we were still scraping for more details about the amendment at that time. Now, it turns out that the changes centered on the proposed fees of the company. Based on the previous disclosure of the SEC, BlackRock will be charging 0.20% for the first year or the first $5 billion of its assets under management (AUM) in relation to the spot Bitcoin ETFs, whichever comes first. Beyond that will be a 0.30% fee going forward. The updated filing of the company further decreases the proposed fees of the firm to 0.25% after the waiver to keep up with the competition. Among the applicants, Bitwise appears to have the best offer for customers by waiving its fees in the initial six months of operation of its spot Bitcoin ETF or up to the first $1 billion AUM and 0.24% thereafter. Besides its entry into the spot Bitcoin ETF niche, BlackRock has also been aggressively expanding its reach in the BTC mining sector. The Wall Street giant possesses major stakes in two of the biggest players in this industry, namely Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms. Additionally, it has investments in Cipher Mining, TeraWulf, Stronghold Digital, Greenidge Generation Holdings, and Cleanspark. Despite being the star of the show in the spot Bitcoin ETF saga, BlackRock is currently embroiled in a series of controversies regarding its labor layoffs and for cutting down its Environmental Social Governance (ESG) efforts. In line with the latter, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a recent interview that he will no longer be mentioning the acronym “ESG” because of the issues they tend to stir up."
2024-01-10 12:06:14+00:00,Digital Deception: SEC’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Hoax Spurs Lawsuits,https://blockzeit.com/digital-deception-secs-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-hoax-spurs-lawsuits/,"With the dust yet to settle from yesterday’s false Bitcoin ETF approval tweet, the SEC is set to face a series of lawsuits from big industry names in that regard. Crypto high hopers embraced the news with glee last night, only to be disappointed about an hour later with the regulator stating that the “unauthorized” tweet was due to a compromised Twitter account. Businessman and Tennessee state senator, Bill Hagerty, has described the SEC’s fake spot bitcoin ETF approval as a “collosal market-moving mistake” and “completely unacceptable.” According to Hagerty who is also a member of the Senate Banking and Foreign Relations Committees, the SEC needs to answer to Congress on what just happened. “Just like the SEC would demand accountability from a public company if they made such a colossal market-moving mistake, Congress needs answers on what just happened. This is unacceptable,” tweeted Hagerty. The SEC, especially under its current chief Gary Gensler, has always been associated with the skepticism and the daredevil policing with which it approaches issues pertaining to cryptocurrency and related infrastructure. The agency would have most likely escalated a blunder of this magnitude if it had come from the crypto industry, which explains why everyone affected wants it to bear the brunt of the mistake. Some industry titans, besides voicing out their displeasure with the SEC over the deceptive announcement, have also made a move to sue the SEC over market manipulation. One of such people is Ran Neuner, Founder of Onchain Capital and Host of CNBC’s Crypto Trader. “I’m suing the SEC and Gary Gensler for market manipulation,” said Neuner on X. Richard Heart, American cryptocurrency founder, is another dignitary that’s voiced out his legal tussle with the SEC. In Heart’s words, he’s “fighting the SEC for your rights.”  11 of Heart’s lawyers, yesterday, filed a reply to an earlier SEC complaint, with the crux being to give blockchain technology greater foothold and freedom, using his own cryptocurrencies as the focal point. “I am fighting the SEC for your rights. 11 of my lawyers filed this today. Ironically, today, the SEC’s twitter account was hacked and a fraudulent message was posted. The blockchain literally solves exactly this problem. The SEC is attacking the very tech that it needs. Cryptographically verifiable authentication, proof and publication… Technology is the future. We pray to the courts to defend the constitution and your rights. #Bitcoin,” said Heart. While Heart’s filing isn’t directly linked to the SEC’s false tweet, he announced it in the wake of the event to intensify the SEC’s backwardness in terms of blockchain technology and how embracing the technology would have prevented issues such as this one."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2024-01-10 10:21:51+00:00,Conspiracy Theories Surface As Probe On SEC Hacking Continues,https://blockzeit.com/conspiracy-theories-surface-as-probe-on-sec-hacking-continues/,"The cryptocurrency community is buzzing with speculations as to what really transpired within the ranks of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) following its premature spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) announcement on X (formerly Twitter). Despite the basic reasoning of the agency that it was nothing but a result of a hack in its social media account and X’s preliminary investigation pinning the activity to an “unidentified individual” who just happened to get an access of a phone number linked to the regulator’s account, a lot of people are not buying it. People are now airing their displeasure at the costly mistake of the SEC and politicians are demanding accountability. Although the regulator pointed the blame to a hacker, the investigation by X Safety just exposed how their incompetence actually contributed to the whole affair. For a government body that is tasked with safeguarding the interest of the investing public, they couldn’t even be bothered to enable the two-factor authentication of their social media account. This only made it easier for the perpetrator to waltz into their X channel and cause chaos in the market. Just like the SEC would demand accountability from a public company if they made such a colossal market-moving mistake, Congress needs answers on what just happened. This is unacceptable. https://t.co/tWtLqHtqpu For a catastrophic event occurring hours before the anticipated verdict of the SEC on at least one of the spot Bitcoin ETF filings, this simplistic scenario of a hacking incident is too hard to believe. Mere incompetence is such a convenient excuse for them. At face value, something is definitely wrong here. No one with that kind of conviction makes a game-changing action that’s capable of pumping or sinking the market just for the fun of it, and knowing the trouble they would run into later on. There has to be a driving factor for it. And in this case, let’s not look further than the element of money. The so-called hacking incident was just so timely, too. Of all dates, it has to be moments before the expected ruling of the SEC on a spot Bitcoin ETF. This is certainly a well-planned move and something that surely made a lot of cash for the people involved. Easy Money!The consensus is on the watch for a potential market manipulation happening with only hours to go until the expected verdict of at least one spot #BitcoinETF filing. The bad actors may possibly have a huge stake in #Bitcoin, hence, orchestrating hype for the digital… Adam Cochran, the founder of Cinneamhain Ventures (CEHV), also presents an interesting take on the events that transpired. He thinks the SEC account was both hacked but the post was real. Cochran said it’s possible that the hacker simply found the announcement lying in the draft folders of the account and proceeded to jump the gun with it. He noted that the intricate graphic included in the tweet couldn’t have been created on a whim, too. For him, the approval announcement was already lined up, but it just went off earlier than intended. My guess is that the SEC account was both hacked AND that the tweet was real.Hacker first tweeted and then deleted just a ticker.Then likely found the tweet with the announcement graphic and Gensler quote in the draft folder.SEC wouldn’t get date wrong, and tweet only… pic.twitter.com/RQp7Mo4Zey These past few hours have been tense but if there’s something good that may have come out of it is that now we have a basis for the immediate price movements of Bitcoin should one or more of its related spot ETFs are given the nod by the SEC. The sudden p also gives us a confirmation of the digital asset’s strong base at the $45K level should things fail to go as expected today."
2024-01-10 08:07:41+00:00,Fake Bitcoin ETF Approvals Causes Stir With The US SEC – Are We Still Getting A Spot Bitcoin ETF?,https://blockzeit.com/fake-bitcoin-etf-approvals-causes-stir-with-the-us-sec/,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) tweets out fake news that the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been approved.  However, the securities agency and Chairman Gary Gensler are saying the account was compromised. What does this mean for the actual approval of the Bitcoin ETFs, which are anticipated to be announced on January 10th? The @SECGov X account was compromised, and an unauthorized post was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products. According to the SEC and Gary Gensler, the SEC X account was compromised. And they tweeted out that the agency has not yet approved the listing and trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs. In a now deleted post, the misleading announcement looked legit as well as the voicing, wording, and there was even an image of Gary Gensler with a quote. But of course it was fake. The @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products. Gensler also tweeted out, “The @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.” Read: SEC Chair Gary Gensler Posts FUD Targeting Cryptos Amid The Expected Spot Bitcoin ETF Rulings So, what does this mean for the ultimate approvals, which were anticipated to happen on January 10th, and to start trading on the 11th? We will have to wait and see.  The recent issues were a complete mess, and it would not surprise me if the SEC delayed a few days to let the dust settle here and figure out what is happening. Most analysts still think that things will still go on track because this is not something you do overnight. And there is usually a lot of prep work, letters, and a lot of disclosures. So it could be that things will still go as smoothly as possible tomorrow. Read: Bitcoin’s Next Chapter: What To Expect After Spot Bitcoin ETFs Have Been Approved? Gary Gensler was part of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). And under him, the MF Global collapse and a whole bunch of nonsense that took place in 2008 happened under his watch. So Gensler has a track record of a “royal screw up” as a regulator. And we know that under the SEC, he let Celsius collapse, he let FTX collapse, and he was meeting with Sam Bankman-Fried along with FTX officials. Just like the SEC would demand accountability from a public company if they made such a colossal market-moving mistake, Congress needs answers on what just happened. This is unacceptable. https://t.co/tWtLqHtqpu We also have US Senator Bill Hagerty noticing the recent issue, tweeting out, “Just like the SEC would demand accountability from a public company if they made such a colossal market-moving mistake, Congress needs answers on what just happened. This is unacceptable.” Blaming the tweet, which was carefully worded and included a produced graphic, on a hacked account is a continuation of amateurish and dishonest nature of the current SEC leadership regime. Speculations from the crypto community theorizes that the now deleted post was actually real but was misscheduled. Because the tweet looked legit — it looked like it was a scheduled tweet and maybe someone screwed up and tweeted it out early, right? I am not saying that it is likely, but it is possible. Another point to consider is, why would the hacker tweet out the approval instead of a denial? The hacker could have instead tweeted a denial to crash the price of Bitcoin. On TV right on talking about this.. and yes, I think someone prepped a planned tweet and put wrong date, bc the tweet would have made PERFECT sense tomorrow at this time. The language sounds legit SEC-ish IMO vs a crypto knucklehead pulling a prank but I guess we'll see.. https://t.co/lP6Nghi6fq Senior ETF Analyst for Bloomberg Eric Balchunas also tweeted out the following, “I think someone prepped a planned tweet and put the wrong date, because the tweet would have made PERFECT sense tomorrow at this time. The language sounds legit SEC-ish IMO vs a crypto knucklehead pulling a prank but I guess we’ll see..” Was it really a hack? Or was it something else that was someone pulling the strings? If this was not market manipulation, then I don’t know what is. This is the exact type of thing the SEC is meant to stop — it is supposed to be the agency that protects consumers and investors from these false announcements. But one thing for sure is that this whole debacle further destroys Gensler’s political optics due to the highlights of his failures."
2024-01-10 04:43:16+00:00,Breaking News: X Provides Result Of Probe In SEC Hacking,https://blockzeit.com/breaking-news-x-provides-result-of-probe-in-sec-hacking/,"A couple of hours ago, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced the approval of all spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange traded funds (ETFs) through its official social media account on X (formerly Twitter). Moments later, the regulator said that the post was false and it was a result of a hacking incident. X owner and CTO Elon Musk then greenlit an investigation on the matter, and now, they have an official statement on their findings. X’s Safety team confirmed that there was a hacking incident on the SEC account, which resulted in the controversial spot Bitcoin ETF posting. The breach was traced to an “unidentified individual” who gained access to a phone number linked to the official social media channel of the regulator through a third-party source. The probe also exposed a major flaw overlooked by the social media managers of the agency. Their failure to activate their two-factor authentication apparently made it very easy for the perpetrator to breach their channel. X’s Safety team encouraged everyone to secure their accounts by enabling this extra layer of security. We can confirm that the account @SECGov was compromised and we have completed a preliminary investigation. Based on our investigation, the compromise was not due to any breach of X’s systems, but rather due to an unidentified individual obtaining control over a phone number… While the incident can be conveniently dismissed as a mere lack of foresight on the persons in charge of SEC’s social media, a potential inside job or the angle of market manipulation can’t be ruled out altogether. Heads are sure to roll in the aftermath of this event as it already caught the attention of the higher-ups like US Senator Bill Hagerty. For sure, Musk will also have more to reveal about the subject later on as his team further looks into the issue. The consensus, however, is on the watch for a potential market manipulation happening with only hours to go until the expected verdict of at least one spot Bitcoin ETF filing. The bad actors may possibly have a huge stake in Bitcoin, hence, orchestrating a hype for the digital asset to drive up its price. And surely, BTC nearly tapped the $48K range when the announcement got the attention of investors. The degens may have also placed a “short” as they risked getting exposed and in anticipation of the resulting downward movement of BTC moments later. It should be noted that the premier cryptocurrency indeed dipped to $45K as soon as the SEC disclosed the hacking affair. As of press time, Bitcoin is hovering around $46K as it waits for the smoke to clear. The consolation to all of these though is that we just witnessed a strong support of BTC at the $45K line, which is a major improvement since the previous trading periods of 2023 to the present."

Then, the announcement finally came in the X (formerly Twitter) account of the regulator a few hours ago. However, the post was immediately taken down and it was blamed on a hacking incident. The @SECGov X account was compromised, and an unauthorized post was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products. Remember when the SEC told us to only trust the information they provide instead of third-party sources, especially when it comes to the status of the spot Bitcoin ETFs under review? So, they did make an announcement earlier via their official account on X. “Today the SEC grants approval for #Bitcoin ETFs for listing on all registered national securities exchanges,” said the SEC on the social media platform. “The approved Bitcoin ETFs will be subject to ongoing surveillance and compliance measures to ensure continued investor protection.” It also came with an official statement from SEC Chair Gary Gensler saying, “Today’s approval enhances market transparency and provides investors with efficient access to digital asset investments within a regulated framework.” Moments later, they retracted and claimed a hacker was responsible for it. “The @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted,” Gensler told the public later. “The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.” With an event like this happening within the crucial hours of the crypto community and the overall financial market, heads are about to roll. All concerned parties are now calling for the investigation of the hacking activity and securities lawyers are even looking into the angle of a possible market manipulation. According to various sources, X owner and CTO Elon Musk is currently investigating the cause of the SEC hack. US Senator Bill Hagerty was also fuming as he commented that the incident was “unacceptable” and called for Congress to conduct a probe. The SEC’s decision on the spot Bitcoin ETF filings holds a major implication for the BTC ecosystem. So, the botched announcement spiked the digital asset close to $48K at $47,893.70 before the fraud was exposed. And just like that, it slumped to $45,244.72 following Gensler’s revelation of the hacking. As of this writing at 3:30 AM UTC, Bitcoin is trading at $46,202.55 as the market comes to terms with the latest chain of events and as it awaits the “real” official announcement."
2024-01-09 16:36:23+00:00,Analysts Provide A Conservative Estimate On How Much Will Bitcoin Pop When The Spot ETFs Are Approved,https://blockzeit.com/analysts-provide-a-conservative-estimate-on-how-much-will-bitcoin-pop-when-the-spot-etfs-are-approved/,"We only have hours to go before the anticipated decision of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on all pending spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange traded funds (ETF), or at least on the filing of Ark Invest. With that, there’s an ongoing excitement as to how the digital asset’s price will react to this pivotal event in the world of finance. Some popular analysts on Crypto Twitter just threw in their hats on the subject with a conservative yet realistic prediction. There are super bullish projections out there going up to the hundred grand but there are some who do not think that Bitcoin’s price will just magically pump to the moon at that range. The pseudonymous Doctor Profit (@DrProfitCrypto) on X thinks that the incoming spot Bitcoin ETF is almost priced in the charts. What if I tell you that halving event is more powerful than ETF event ?What if I tell you that #BTC halving starts in April, and all golden bull markets started 4-8 months after halving ?What if I tell you that holding spot and patience is the best strategy to follow ? According to the self-proclaimed elite trader who claims to trade based on psychology, the spot Bitcoin ETFs will be nothing compared to the halving happening in April this year. The analyst believes a nod by the SEC on the new financial instruments will only raise BTC values between a local top of $48K and $52K before undergoing correction. Everyone was bullish till DrProfit announced that 48-52k is local topI announced that 47-48k is next when BTC was at 40k, they copied sameNow big accounts on Twitter copying the same idea of 48-52k correctionLet them steal from DrProfit ⏳ Meanwhile, the halving may not immediately yield significant results. However, the trader says major price movements will occur four to eight months after, which is how golden bull markets are designed. Another popular crypto guru who goes by the alias Ali (@ali_charts) mirrors the same conservative view in the aftermath of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval. The analyst starts by assuring investors that BTC has already established a solid support zone at $42K, thanks to the backing of 2.48 million wallet addresses with a combined haul of 1.12 million BTC. The crypto expert then proceeds to explain that if Bitcoin can overcome the $48K resistance, it could go north up to $55K. #Bitcoin has established a solid support zone at $42,000, backed by 2.48 million addresses holding over 1.12 million $BTC. If #Bitcoin can successfully breach the $48,000 resistance, on-chain data suggests a clear path ahead. With no major supply zones in sight, #BTC could be… pic.twitter.com/xfNHbg3gyy These are indeed viable estimates, but with just hours remaining on the January 10 deadline, it won’t be a long wait until we find out if any of these scenarios play out. The most important question right now though is whether or not at least one spot Bitcoin ETF will see the light of day tomorrow. Several news outlets previously reported that BlackRock is super bullish on the matter. Recently, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck also chimed in with optimism about their approval a few hours from now. The exec further said that several firms may start trading them by Thursday if they get the green light from the SEC."
2024-01-09 13:13:18+00:00,Breaking News: BlackRock Revises Spot Bitcoin ETF Application,https://blockzeit.com/breaking-news-blackrock-refiles-spot-bitcoin-etf-application-with-revisions/,"BlackRock just submitted another amendment for its spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange traded fund (ETF). This comes less than a day before the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is scheduled to give its verdict on the first filing due by tomorrow (January 10). The SEC appears to be stirring things up with just a day remaining before the anticipated approval of the pending spot Bitcoin ETFs. News outlets that have been on close watch for the landmark event have been reporting additional comments given by the regulator in relation to the filings. In line with these, the institutions vying to get a slice of the new segment of the market have submitted their amended S-1 forms. Now, it has come to our attention that BlackRock has just forwarded a new revision for its spot Bitcoin ETF with the IBIT ticker, too. Right now, we’re still scraping more context into this breaking news but we are on close watch on the nature of the said changes in the giant asset management firm’s re-filing. It also remains to be seen how the new developments could affect the expected verdict of the regulator for the other applicants, especially Ark Invest’s Ark 21 Shares. BREAKING: BlackRock just filed another amendment for its $IBIT #Bitcoin ETFAnother step toward approval 🚀 pic.twitter.com/zcO0XrskGt As we veer into a momentous event in history that could potentially shake up not only the crypto community but also the world of finance, the shills are now running the mill at double the rate. We are now seeing a wider division between the cheerleaders of these game-changing financial instruments and people spreading FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) about them. In the narration of the pessimists, the new comments of the SEC may signal delays in the ruling of the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Some even equate the affair to a looming denial of the applications. The recent comments of SEC Chair Gary Gensler against cryptos in a series of posts on X are not helping alleviate the mood either. But come to think of it; if the regulator really wanted to deny the spot Bitcoin ETFs, it could have just gone on with the rejection from the get-go. There’s no point in wasting its time to entertain the applicants and guide them throughout the process only so it could throw them off the cliff. Taking that direction is so counter-intuitive. Even if the applications are to be delayed, this should not be viewed as tantamount to denial. A delay could still mean it could happen at some point. It may only be ironing out the kinks to ensure that no one will run into trouble once the ship goes full sail."
2024-01-09 11:20:38+00:00,Bitcoin’s Next Chapter: What To Expect After Spot Bitcoin ETFs Have Been Approved?,https://blockzeit.com/what-to-expect-after-spot-bitcoin-etfs-have-been-approved/,"As reported last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked all ETF applicants to submit their final revisions. And apparently, every single issuer did. January 10th may be the day the securities regulator finally accepts the applications from thirteen investment firms for the spot Bitcoin ETF. Right now, applicants are taking this spot Bitcoin ETF very seriously on proving their name, as they are working their way to promote their product through competitive fees and advertisements. But the eternal question on every crypto trader/investor’s mind is, what should you expect in the coming weeks, months, or years, assuming it will finally be approved? Many believe we need to have an alternative ecosystem: monetarily, financially and societally, in order to circumvent and go around the mainstream. And the only way that exists, at least from what I can tell, is Bitcoin — the original and the decentralized currency, and the hedge against the current global financial system. However, we are now seeing a convergence of Legacy and the Decentralized system. The Bitcoin ETFs, if approved, would be a merger between Legacy and crypto — everyone is talking about Bitcoin going into the Legacy system, and now we are talking about things like commodities, equities (stocks), real world assets (RWAs) and other items going into the decentralized system. This is going to be the talk of the town for the next couple of decades because we are fully revolutionizing and evolving the way money and ownership works. We are currently living in highly digital lives, and of course we are going to start bringing in real estate, deeds and all the rest online as well. Read: Banking and Web3: How Banks Can Attract Digital Natives and Harness the Power of NFTs  In the next couple of weeks, you are probably gonna see Bitcoin and other altcoins which they call “Darth Maul” wicks. In other words, the market will be very volatile, opening in the middle, then wicking above and below before the candle closes. After you have these dramatic spikes in both directions, it is going to retest each spike — up and down. You are going to see volatility in crypto that is unprecedented. Now, if you are a day trader, that is great! If you are not, you are going to get caught up in the emotion.  The beginning of the Bitcoin ETF is like the first drop — do you ever see how they cut like a little sliver into a dam and a few drops of water start coming through? Then after an hour or two, the dam bursts open and it is all flooding downstream. In the first two days, it is probably going to be rather muted — we are going to see the money come in, but it is not going to be overnight. However, what happens over the next five years is going to be unbelievable. Read: The Industry Is Waiting: Bitcoin Spot ETF Approvals This Week Will Pump The Crypto Markets! I know we have been talking a lot about the Bitcoin ETF and whether it is coming in January 10th or gets denied, and it comes in March instead. None of this fundamentally really matters all that much if we are talking about short-term price action. But we have never seen such financial minutia reported as vigorously as it is being reported about the spot Bitcoin ETF. We are currently at the precipice right now, wherein we are looking out across the vast plains of an unimaginable bull run of epic proportions, in which generational wealth will be created for tens of thousands of people (if you remember to sell obviously). The big picture here is just the beginning."

Over the last ten years, the ETF has faced challenges in gaining approval from the SEC in the United States. However, in the interview, Clayton stated that the reason for disapproval of the Bitcoin ETF is fraud and market manipulation. JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Former SEC Chair says spot #Bitcoin ETF approval is inevitable, ""there's nothing left to decide."" pic.twitter.com/09ajeAEElI Jay Clayton cited that the Bitcoin market is better than five years ago; “The market is better today than it was Five years ago, there was wash sales, laundering, and fraud. We wouldn’t risk approval from the general public because of all sorts of things.” Jay concluded. However, Clayton mentioned that the regulators have taken a huge step towards the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, congratulating them for reaching this point and acknowledging it as a significant move for them to understand and accept Bitcoin. The approval is set to mark a milestone for traditional institutions and the United States at large. Investors and institutions will have the ability to access the market without directly associating with Bitcoin. “It is a huge moment for the financial market; the traditional market will have exposure to the crypto market, specifically Bitcoin, through regulated investment institutions,” Clayton projected. He congratulated the crypto market for advancements, especially in blockchain technology stating, “This is a big step, not just for Bitcoin but for finance generally. If you can tokenize underlying assets and trade that way, That’s a potentially significant change across finance, not just in the crypto space.” All eyes are on Gary Gensler, as the deadline is just a few hours away. This will mark a milestone for the crypto market and the financial industry at large. A bull market is anticipated to occur; moreover, Bitcoin has already drawn attention and interest in the market, and a spot Bitcoin ETF is set to create asset maturity. 1. This is true, comments came back on those S-1 documents with the fees that we all went crazy over this morning (this isn't out of ordinary)2. Expect to see more amendments tomorrow because of this3. That said — I don't think this is necessarily a delay signal https://t.co/o2m0lIBSct Additionally, on January 8, ETF issuers submitted amended S-1 and S-3 filings to the SEC, disclosing the amount of fees they wanted to charge ahead of ETF approval. According to James Seyffart, an ETF analyst, it is a sign that regulators are accelerating things.  In the market, Bitcoin was able to surpass the $44,500 and $44,700 resistance levels, marking a significant increase of 5%. The coin is moving at a large pace and is heading towards the $48,000 level. Yesterday, the bulls managed to pump the price of Bitcoin to the $47,300 mark, but selling pressure dominated the market, decreasing the price below $47,000. Resistance is expected at the $47,200 level and $47,000; a move above the $42,000 resistance level will escalate the price to the $48,000 mark."
2024-01-09 08:04:36+00:00,Bitcoin ETF Hope Dashed Again? SEC’s Additional S-1 Comments Stir Controversy,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-etf-sec-s-1-comments/,"In a surprising twist of events, the SEC has issued additional comments on form S-1s of spot Bitcoin ETF applicants. The comments came not long after the prospective bitcoin ETF issuers submitted documents outlining the proposed fees for their products. The SEC’s prompt response to these latest filings has provoked mixed feelings with many feeling they’ve just deployed another delay tactic from their sleeves. Several industry dignitaries, influencers, and journalists believe something is fishy about the SEC’s prompt comments on the issuers’ form S-1s and that it may be indicative of a possible delay. Perianne Boring, Bitcoin advocate, and CEO of Digital Chamber of Commerce was one of the first conversation starters to call the move a delay signal. “????SPOT BITCOIN ETF UPDATE: The SEC just issued additional comments on pending applicant’s S-1s. This is a delay signal.????,” wrote Boring. Boring’s perspective on the additional S-1 comments didn’t sit well with the very enthusiastic and hopeful spot BTC proponents in her following – who accused her of spreading FUD (Fear Uncertainty and Doubt) – and causing investors to empty their bitcoin bags. Amidst the uncertainty, other well-known voices in the industry have replied the rumors of a possible delay with more civility, stating that it’s a normal step in the approval process and means everything positive for the spot ETF approval. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terret, after speaking with some of the issuers, believes it’s just part of the process to set the stage ready and beat the January 10 approval deadline. “Just spoke with a couple of people who received additional comments. They say they’re not worried and the @SECGov hasn’t conveyed a change of plans.  My sense is that they’re fairly confident this is just part of the process to get everything in before January 10th,” wrote Terret Nate Geraci of ETF Store, who’s been an ardent observer and very outspoken about the process also believes it’s a necessary process that won’t affect the approval timeline. “Re: additional SEC comments on prospective spot bitcoin ETF issuer S-1s… “Comments addressed minor details… and should not affect the timeline for a potential approval by the regulator.” Expect updated S-1s tomorrow,” said Geraci. While the industry awaits a potential ETF approval this week, BTC has maintained a healthy growth from the end of last year going into 2024. The gold of cryptocurrencies hit $47k around 8:55 PM UTC yesterday and is currently at $46,913 as of this writing. The industry awaits a favorable outcome from the SEC, which could push BTC to $250K or more."

Well, it lost its momentum. And now that it just pumped to $47K, he’s telling people that it’s already topping. Applying the Inverse Cramer means it’s time to get your diamond hands ready people! On the January 8 Lightning Round of Mad Money, Cramer was asked about what he thought of Bitcoin mining firms that are currently pumping, namely Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital. The host then asked, “What do we do with these?” “Let’s stop fooling around,” he said in an emotionally fueled rant. “If you want Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin!” “I think Bitcoin is topping around, by the way, so I’m gonna say enough is enough,” Cramer stated in a quick U-turn to his earlier statements. Just like that, he proceeded to smack the ka-ching button to wrap up his segment. Works every time! pic.twitter.com/ABYXVtkqqx By now, those who are familiar with the cryptocurrency predictions of Cramer have noticed that the opposite scenario tends to play around. For example, when the analyst told people to “ignore crypto cheerleaders” during BTC’s resurgence to the $20K line last year, the digital asset actually went to a bullish trend. There was, however, a change of tone from Cramer in November last year when he admitted that his calls towards Bitcoin were “premature.” Then he went on to tell people to buy BTC if they like it. Post the New Year celebrations, he continued preaching about the premier cryptocurrency by market cap. “This thing, you can’t kill it,” Cramer told CNBC host David Faber. “Bitcoin is a technological marvel and I think people need to start recognizing it’s here to stay,” he continued. And guess what happened? Bitcoin greeted 2024 with a bang as it surged to $45K. It was the first time in nearly two years for the crypto to reach such heights. As soon as Cramer’s remarks were made, BTC slumped back to the $41K territory. For some, it may be another coincidence, but for others, it’s Inverse Cramer at play. With that in mind, is his latest forecast a confirmation of Bitcoin’s further climb? Works every time! pic.twitter.com/ABYXVtkqqx Inverse Cramer is a play the crypto community invented based on the projections of Jim Cramer. The mechanics of this is simple, you just do what the financial analyst says. The coincidences of the opposite occurring, however, are so hard to ignore. So, when Seeking Alpha collated Cramer’s top 10 picks over a period at the end of 2022, it found that more often than not, the strategy yielded gains. Quantifying this would mean a $100 million investment made in the past two years using Inverse Cramer would have resulted a compounded earnings of $147.20 million! Works every time! pic.twitter.com/ABYXVtkqqx Despite what they say about Inverse Cramer, it’s still a risky play and if you don’t lay your cards right, you may end up losing a lot. Notwithstanding this, the consensus carries a bullish outlook for Bitcoin on the way to the anticipated approval of its spot ETFs in the US this week and the halving taking place by April. As always, practice due diligence along the way because investing can be tricky with many factors in motion.

2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2024-01-09 06:49:16+00:00,The Industry Is Waiting: Bitcoin Spot ETF Approvals This Week Will Pump The Crypto Markets!,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-spot-etf-approvals-this-week-will-pump-the-markets/,"We are experiencing so much FOMO in the crypto markets, and the price is pumping like crazy as Bitcoin has surged to approximately 10% and has hit about $47,000 all in anticipation of the Bitcoin spot ETF being approved by multiple applicants. Crypto investors are eagerly awaiting a decision from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Thirteen companies have filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF:  Multiple issuers said that they expect to receive final approval (or disapproval) of S-1 filings by late Tuesday or Wednesday. Simply put, an S-1 filing is a filing to register a new security with the SEC. JUST IN: Spot #Bitcoin ETFs expected to be approved Wednesday and could begin trading this week, CNBC reports. pic.twitter.com/e0TfBrRIXK The big news of the day though, is that CNBC is reporting that the Bitcoin spot ETFs could be approved by Wednesday. So that will be on the 10th of January, and trading could happen this week. Fees spot bitcoin ETF filers: Grayscale – 1.5% Ark 21Shares – 0.25% * iShares/BlackRock – 0.30% *Bitwise – 0.24% *VanEck – 0.25% Wisdomtree 0.50% Invesco Galaxy 0.59% * Fidelity – 0.39% Valkyrie 0.80% Hashdex 0.90% Franklin 0.295 * means there's a lower % to start Now, what’s fascinating is that the competition around fees has been heating up. And look, competition is great for the consumer, so this is good. Everyone is trying to come out the door with a big bang, right? They know the competition is going to heat up here. There is going to be big marketing around this product and they can always start off with low fees and then increase those fees over time. The fact that they are doing this, they are having this game theory playing out here, this competition for these fees shows that. I think they are confident that the approvals are around the corner, even if Gary Gensler might decide to delay this for another week or two. Read: What You Need To Know About Bitcoin Spot ETF Fees — Is It Worth It? Standard Chartered posting some moon math! $200,000 coming pic.twitter.com/IQueMhjgiP Standard Chartered Bank put out a prediction, saying that Bitcoin spot ETFs may bring in $50 billion to $100 billion of inflows this 2024. It’s to be seen. I personally do not know how much capital is going to come in. I believe capital will come in over time. One of the things you do not want to fall into or traps you do not want to fall into, is that as soon as it is approved, that means $500 billion is coming into the market the next day — it does not happen that way. There will be a crawl-walk-run process. So please keep that in mind. The media will try to hype it up as though next month you are going to see a billion dollars. It is going to take time — the marketing is going to start, and they still have to educate the wealth managers and registered investment advisors. Read: Standard Chartered Announces Blockchain Unit For Asset Tokenization We are also getting recent reports that JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are in talks with Grayscale about the Bitcoin ETF role. Other reports including BlackRock and Valkyrie are named Authorized Participants (AP), including JPMorgan, for the Bitcoin ETF. And just a month ago, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was sitting with US Senator Elizabeth Warren in front of Congress saying this is all for scammers, fraudsters and criminals. Read: JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon: Governments Should Shut Down Bitcoin & Crypto – Details A thread 🧵Some things to keep in mind if you're considering investing in crypto assets: Gary Gensler recently did something interesting. He usually puts out his propaganda around crypto, but some people are calling out that this time around, he did not say “crypto asset securities” — he said “crypto asset investments.” A very interesting change of tone. So, the fact that he is naming it this way, is a very bullish sign, and he is losing. He knows that just going around saying “crypto asset securities” is actually prejudging the market. Read: US SEC Coins New Term For Digital Assets In Its Recent Investor Alert Letter – Details We are supposed to get an answer as early as today from January 8th to January 10th, but one thing that I want to remind you is that just because these are big players like BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity and everybody else, does not mean it is going to get approved. I personally think we have a strong chance of it getting approved. But at the same time, so many people are getting absolutely wrecked by shorting the market right now. But anything is possible. Gary Gensler could pull out some sort of delay tactic. Who knows what he would come up with. Is that highly probable though? I do not think so. I think the approvals will happen, but you never know. So just be prepared is what I am saying."
2024-01-09 06:00:02+00:00,SEC Chair Gary Gensler Posts FUD Targeting Cryptos Amid The Expected Spot Bitcoin ETF Rulings,https://blockzeit.com/sec-chair-gary-gensler-posts-fud-targeting-cryptos-amid-the-expected-spot-bitcoin-etf-rulings/,"This year is a great time to be a part of the cryptocurrency community. We have the spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) that are gearing up to shake the very foundations of Wall Street and the halving in the BTC ecosystem a few months from now. However, US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler appears to be raining down on the Bitcoin bandwagon’s parade as he posted several warnings about crypto assets in a series of tweets on the X platform (formerly Twitter). The three-part rant of Gensler started off by emphasizing that not all crypto asset investments may be compliant with regulations, especially the provisions of federal securities laws. He cautioned investors about firms that may be withholding key information pertaining to the protections of their investments. 1⃣ Those offering crypto asset investments/services may not be complying w/ applicable law, including federal securities laws. Investors in crypto asset securities should understand they may be deprived of key info & other important protections in connection w/ their investment. The SEC Chair also pointed out the volatility inherent to cryptocurrencies. He reminded everyone that many crypto projects have been bankrupted due to this factor. 2⃣ Investments in crypto assets also can be exceptionally risky & are often volatile. A number of major platforms & crypto assets have become insolvent and/or lost value. Investments in crypto assets continue to be subject to significant risk. In the last part, Gensler pointed out how these digital assets have been a breeding ground for scams. These include fraudulent coin offerings, Ponzi and pyramid schemes, and theft. 3⃣Fraudsters continue to exploit the rising popularity of crypto assets to lure retail investors into scams. These investments continue to be replete w/ fraud- bogus coin offerings, Ponzi & pyramid schemes, & outright theft where a project promoter disappears w/ investors’ money. The seemingly noble cause of Gensler, however, was met with resistance from a majority of the responses. One user sarcastically thanked him for protecting us against fraudsters like FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried and Celsius’ Alex Mashinsky. Another criticized the government watchdog for not even knowing how to do a thread. Our favorite though was the comment telling everyone that unlike banks and the entire Western financial system, the cryptocurrency sector has never been a subject of a central bank bailout. The industry has also survived countless crises despite the central bank and traditional banks conspiring against it. 4️⃣ Unlike banks and the entire western financial system, crypto has never had a central bank bailout. In fact, central banks are actively conspiring against it. And yet its price is fast approaching all time highs having survived countless crises on its own The recent remarks of Gary Gensler amid the anticipated spot Bitcoin ETF verdicts no longer come as a surprise because he has always been opposed to cryptocurrencies. Over the years, he issued the same warnings against them whenever he had the had the chance, telling people about how they have been a hotbed for scams and their volatile nature. The SEC Chair has a more mellow stance on Bitcoin though. During a congressional hearing in October 2023, he reaffirmed the status of BTC in relation to the Howey test. “I would say it’s not a security and then the test is otherwise for other laws,” he told the members of the legislature when asked about his view on Bitcoin. It should be noted as well that he never specifically mentioned Bitcoin in his recent posts, so they could very well be directed to other cryptos."

This surge is attributed to the anticipation of a positive outcome regarding the approval of Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). JUST IN: $47,000 #Bitcoin After a full day of rallying, the BTC price entered the highest level since the previous bull market and passed $47,000.

January 10, 2024, is the day Bitcoin spot ETF gets approved opening up Bitcoin investment to non-crypto investors. Spot Bitcoin ETF applicants were expected to submit their Form S-1 amendments by Monday, January 8, 2024, 8:00 AM EST. As of 07:50 AM EST, only 9 out of the 11 applicants had submitted their S-1s. These are BlackRock, ARK 21Shares, VanEck, Valkyrie, WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, Fidelity, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and Wilshire Phoenix BREAKING‼️ Bitcoin ETF Issuers have less than 2 hours submit their final S1s to the SEC by the 8am deadline.Submissions so far:– BlackRock– ARK 21Shares– VanEck– Valkyrie– WisdomTree– Invesco Galaxy This comes just a few days after the 11 applicants submitted their 19b-4 amendment forms. The S-1 forms include crucial information about the spot Bitcoin ETF, including fees and identities of the market makers for the ETFs.  Eric Balchunas, an ETF expert from Bloomberg correctly predicted that final S-1 forms will be filed on January 8, 2024. Eric also tweeted “It’s basically done” on January 5, 2024, referring to the fact that the SEC was trying to line every applicant up for a live ETF launch on January 11, 2024. Even though Balchinas is basically convinced of an ETF approval, he stated that “You gotta leave a little window open for these things (rejection)” On the heightened tension of a Bitcoin spot ETF approval, Bitcoin price rose and crossed above $45,000 once more, setting the market on an extremely bullish sentiment. It is possible a $50,000 Bitcoin price coil tbe seen in the next few days. Furthermore, in the S-1 forms submitted, a key pattern of applicants lowering their fees has stood out. BlackRock’s lowered to 0.30%, and ARK lowered to 0.25%, among others. This shows that these Wall Street giants are competing to offer cheap access to BTC-denominated tokens."
2024-01-08 13:36:11+00:00,Applicants Reveal The Proposed Fees Of The Coming Spot Bitcoin ETFs,https://blockzeit.com/proposed-fees-of-spot-bitcoin-etfs/,"We just caught wind of major updates on the pending spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the US. Today, some of the applicants have already disclosed their proposed fees for them, and it should blow your mind. As of 8:00 AM ET or 1:00 PM UTC, the following announcements just came up: The continuing progress of the spot Bitcoin ETF filings under review by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is fueling speculations of their guaranteed approval within this week. As a result, Bitcoin once again tapped the $45K as the hype train primed its engine. As of press time, Bitcoin is hovering around $45,000, which shows an increase of over 1% in the 24-hour chart. The positive news also caused a spike in the trading volume of the digital asset by 75% as more than $30.044 billion worth of BTC moved between wallets and crypto exchanges. The circulating supply of the premier cryptocurrency in the market today sits at 19.5929 million BTC. Meanwhile, the uptick in price bumped its market cap to $882.122 billion. The momentum of Bitcoin is gradually narrowing the gap from its all-time high of $68,789 on November 10, 2021, to 34%. These figures may appear to be a long way to go at present values, but the two major events occurring in the BTC ecosystem this year, namely the anticipated spot ETF approvals and the halving, are seen by analysts as just the primary ingredients we need to surpass them."
2024-01-08 13:16:24+00:00,Fresh Updates On Pending Spot Bitcoin ETFs In The US,https://blockzeit.com/fresh-updates-on-pending-spot-bitcoin-etfs-in-the-us/,"Tensions are now running high and the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) factory is working double-time as the anticipated deadline of Ark Invest’s spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange traded funds (ETFs) draws near. The same date of its ruling on January 10 is also widely speculated to coincide with the verdict on the filings of other players in the niche like BlackRock, Grayscale, VanEck, Fidelity, and others. Recently, ETF Store President Nate Geraci doubled down on the likelihood of spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday, January 10, in an X post. The exec didn’t mention the entities who will possibly get the green light but he shared a screencap of reports identifying BlackRock as a likely candidate. The same sources also say that the world’s largest asset management firm is confident of the date. Based on the latest developments in the spot Bitcoin ETF saga, the amended S-1 filing of all parties involved is due by 8:00 AM ET today. With that, the verdict of the regulator on them could come as early as tomorrow or Wednesday. This could pave the way for the official announcements or launches around Thursday or Friday. So, it should be cleared out that it should not come as a surprise if we don’t hear about anything on the 10th yet, but the following days could be crucial for the market. Looks like BlackRock believes Wednesday is the day for spot bitcoin ETF approval…via @CGasparino https://t.co/RERN4YvpUy pic.twitter.com/U3xD129eBu It appears the SEC is only ironing out some “minor” kinks in three spot Bitcoin ETF requests. Citing the information provided by mainstream news sources, the unnamed issuers only need to divulge the fees and identities of the market-makers in their filing. Speaking of the fees, ARK just cut down its numbers from the original 0.80% to 0.25%. Meanwhile, BlackRock promised to charge only 0.20% for the first 12 months or the first $5 billion assets under management (AUM), whichever comes first. BREAKING: BlackRock and ARK have slashed their #Bitcoin  ETF feesARK – down from 0.80% to 0.25%BlackRock – 0.20% for the first 12 months, or first $5 billion AUM.The fight for customers has started… As everyone is playing ball with the demands of the SEC, starting by shifting from an in-kind redemption model for the ETFs to an in-cash system up to cutting down the fees, we see no more reason for the regulator to deny or further delay their filings. Looking at how the story is progressing, future customers of these new financial instruments will definitely have a lot of reasons to get excited about."
2024-01-07 16:28:37+00:00,Did Satoshi Nakamoto Just Use Binance? Moves $1.17M Worth Of Bitcoin To His Wallet,https://blockzeit.com/satoshi-nakamoto-moves-1-17m-worth-of-bitcoin-to-a-binance-wallet/,"Something happened recently that no one else could explain. Satoshi Nakamoto’s Genesis wallet — the first wallet ever to hold Bitcoin — just received a bunch more Bitcoin! $1,100,000 worth of $BTC was send to Satoshi Nakamoto's wallet address. Either we are about to find out who Satoshi is or someone just sent over a million in #Bitcoin to his address…. pic.twitter.com/AeRnVjduiE A mysterious user went on Binance and bought $1.17 million worth of Bitcoin, and sent it to Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallet — the wallet that has not been touched since the very beginning. And rumors are circulating that the developer behind Bitcoin is back, as his wallet has just received 26.917 Bitcoin. Is this a mistake? Is it really Satoshi Nakamoto shopping on Binance and sending this large amount of money? Let’s discuss! Read: Satoshi Nakamoto Resurfaces: What Could Be Its Implications For Bitcoin A transaction of $1 million is not a small send, so there are three possible reasons for this: The reason behind why the sender is not Satoshi Nakamoto is because, to withdraw that much amount of money from Binance, you have to go through some Know Your Customer (KYC) processes — clear and simple. Some even speculate it is a marketing scheme for the Bitcoin spot ETFs, or it was just a million dollar mistake, in which I do not think it is a mistake to send it to that particular wallet.  I think it could be someone who wants to make sure that Bitcoin spot ETF applicants such as BlackRock, cannot get their hands on that Bitcoin. The sender might want to make sure he/she can deduct the possibility of investment firms obtaining that Bitcoin as best as possible — in addition to contributing to the scarcity of the cryptocurrency. Read: Too Much Success Of Spot Bitcoin ETFs Is Bad For Bitcoin Let us pretend Satoshi Nakamoto is not an important person other than a whale. When you see money flow off from an exchange and be put into a private wallet, that is the thought process of someone who is saying the price is about to go up or is not even considering selling. But the biggest news here does not have anything to do with the price, it has to do with who Satoshi Nakamoto really is, and could this information help us find out more of that detail. The other thing is that anybody can send crypto to any address — if you know what the address is. So people send money to Satoshi Nakamoto all the time, it is just never this much money. If it was indeed a mistake, then that is the cost of admission for the education in crypto. Oftentimes we have to double or even triple check those transactions, and make sure you send a small amount first to an address you have not made a transaction to yet. There is not a whole lot of information outside of what I can show, but my guess is that this is probably a co-opted move by a group of crypto folks who are probably around in the neighborhood, wherein if they were to pool their money that they can afford to lose in exchange for a laugh or for an angle on some kind of story that is going to be able to propel in the coming days."
2024-01-07 10:01:09+00:00,BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF Could Be Approved By January 10 Says Fox Business,https://blockzeit.com/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-could-be-approved-by-january-10-says-fox-business/,"BlackRock seems to be confident that its spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange traded funds (ETFs) will be given the green light by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. That is if the recent report of Fox Business is to be believed. JUST IN: BlackRock expects its Spot #Bitcoin ETF to be approved on Wednesday, Fox Business reports. On Saturday, BlackRock announced that it will be laying off three percent of its workforce. That would mean around 600 employees getting laid off. Despite the backlash, the world’s top asset management firm defended the event as a routine affair. It cited as an example the same decision it laid down last year as part of its restructuring based on employee performance. The report then moved the discussion to the spot Bitcoin ETF filed by BlackRock. Fox Business claimed that the financial institution is expecting the approval of these new financial instruments by Wednesday, January 10. The news actually coincides with what has been circulating in the financial and cryptocurrency world since the previous month. It should be remembered that back in December, Bloomberg Intelligence’s James Seyffart and other industry watchers deduced that the SEC may be gearing up to approve all pending spot Bitcoin ETF filings by January 5th and the official announcements could come as early as the 8th or 10th of the same month. We are yet to learn whether the SEC has already decided on the applications because everyone involved seems to be mum about the matter. However, with the coming Monday happening to be the closest deadline in the forecasts, we are definitely keeping our eyes peeled on the developments. These inferences from financial experts were mostly anchored on rumors from unnamed sources inside both the SEC and the financial entities involved. Fueling these speculations was the apparent haste of the regulator in processing all the applications when it set a hard deadline for all revisions in spot Bitcoin ETF filings on December 29. There’s also the fact that all the applicants have been playing ball with the SEC in finalizing their pending documents. Everyone has already changed the redemption model of their spot Bitcoin ETF into in-cash to appease the government watchdog and increase their chances of getting the nod. The Fox report, coupled with optimism about the SEC’s ruling, pushed Bitcoin back to the $44K territory. As of this writing on Sunday morning (UTC), BTC is trading at $43,990 but the trading volume of the digital asset has dropped by 38% over the 24-hour frame. Could this mean that everyone else is now HODLing in anticipation of the major announcements this week? Stay tuned for more updates as we continuously monitor the market for a potential landmark statement from the SEC this week."
2024-01-07 08:20:15+00:00,Will BlackRock Destroy Bitcoin? Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes Predicts Major Changes,https://blockzeit.com/will-blackrock-destroy-bitcoin/,"As we approach the anticipated approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF in early 2024, the role of industry giants like BlackRock becomes increasingly pivotal. This Forbes article, featuring insights from financial expert Arthur Hayes, delves into the potential consequences of this development. While BlackRock’s entry into the Bitcoin market signifies a major shift, it raises critical questions about their profit-driven motives versus the broader interests of the cryptocurrency community.  This piece offers an in-depth analysis of what this could mean for the future of Bitcoin. Former #Bitmex CEO Arthur Hayes: ETF Success' Might 'Destroy #Bitcoin' https://t.co/ZiNY1teiDu Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, said if managers like BlackRock are too successful, they will completely destroy Bitcoin.  Hayes added that if BlackRock buys up all the Bitcoin, there will be no more Bitcoin transactions and miners would be unable to afford the energy it costs to secure the network. And as a result, they would shut off their machines — without miners, the network dies, and Bitcoin essentially vanishes. He also said that the death of Bitcoin would create space for another crypto monetary network to grow in its place [CBDCs]. This network could just be a reboot of Bitcoin or something different that is an improved adaptation of the original Bitcoin. Read: Bitcoin Positioned For $1M As Wartime Inflation Looms Says Hayes There are no lies detected here and Arthur Hayes is one of the utmost crypto OGs in the space. His statements are 100% right — once Traditional Finance (TradFi) and these powerful public servants come in, they could essentially control the supply of Bitcoin. And he is also correct that if the miners have to shut their miners off, then the Bitcoin blockchain would cease to operate. However, I personally believe the miners will not shut their rigs off, I think they will probably get bought out by a lot of these big entities.  Because at the end of the day, BlackRock, the Federal Reserve, and countries around the world are going to want their fair share, and there are public public servants that do not care about the people in any way, shape or form. Read: Experts Anticipate SEC’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Between January 8th-10th A 30% $BTC crash could follow the #bitcoinETF saga, @CryptoHayes says.@sndr_krisztian reportshttps://t.co/KcqiP0mHMK In his latest blog post, Hayes presents a prediction for the Bitcoin market crash in March, anticipating a severe correction of 30-40% due to the looming market volatility and changes in the Federal Reserve’s financial policies. I personally believe we are seeing BlackRock and other investment firms come into the crypto space because they want to make money, and they also want control. Plus, we have the CBDCs, and I do not know if we will ever have another successful reboot of Bitcoin. But to me, it is more so kind of like a CBDC complete control. Either way, I am not going anywhere — I do not think Bitcoin is going to zero, but I am going to be a little bit cautious with this. I know a lot of people are very supportive — they are very excited about the Bitcoin spot ETFs getting approved, especially BlackRock’s, but if you take a step back and think about it, what exactly has BlackRock actually done for you? They literally own or have shares of most companies in the US, and essentially own everything that we have."
2024-01-06 07:19:01+00:00,Spot Bitcoin Approvals Near as Blackrock Files 19B-4 Amendment Form with the SEC,https://blockzeit.com/spot-bitcoin-approvals-near-as-nasdaq-blackrock-file-19b-4-amendment-form-to-the-sec/,"With only a few days left for a potential Spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC, 11 ETF applicants submitted the 19b-4 amendment form with the SEC yesterday. Acceptance of these filings by the United States Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a green light sign toward spot Bitcoin ETF approval. On January 5th, BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, and a couple of issuers submitted the 19b-4 amendment file late Friday. These asset leaders are among the applicants who filed for a spot-Bitcoin ETF, hoping the SEC will approve the ETF. The crypto community anticipates that the SEC will approve the 19b-4 amendment file on January 10, marking a significant step in signalling approval. Following several meetings between the ETF applicants and the SEC, the filing is the last stage in the SEC’s approval of the ETF. The filing proposes a rule change on stock exchanges to pave the way for ETFs. However, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) had earlier informed the ETF applicants to submit their amended filing by earlier Friday. Sources who did not want to be revealed cited the fact that the SEC will vote on the rule change document next week. Moreover, if the SEC approves the 19b-4 form, it will only approve the S-1 filing amendment for ETFs to start trading. The crypto community and analysts are optimistic that the SEC will approve spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF) for the first time. Drawing an illustration from Eric Balchun X’s post, he wrote, “Yeah, it’s done. The latest I’m hearing (from multiple sources) is that final S-1s are due at 8 am on Monday as the SEC is trying to line everyone up for the January 11th launch.” However, several financial advisers are not sure that the SEC will approve the ETF. Yeah it’s basically done. Latest I’m hearing (from multiple sources) that final S-1s are due 8am on Monday as SEC is trying to line everyone up for Jan 11th launch. That said, I still want to hear it from the SEC to call it official. Moreover, Grayscale is ready for SEC approval. Jenn Rosethel, Grayscale spokeswoman, stated that “this filing is another significant step toward uplisting GBTC as a spot Bitcoin ETF.” She added, “We are working collaboratively with the SEC, and we remain ready to operate GBTC as an ETF upon receipt of the regulatory approval.” The SEC has until January 10 to approve or deny a specific Spot Bitcoin ETF applicant: 21Shares and Ark Investment, as they were the first to resubmit ETF applications. James Seyffart, a Bloomberg analyst, reassured his faith in the SEC and posted on his X account. My view is in line with @EleanorTerrett's reporting. I think the SEC could begin signaling to issuers to expect approvals tho I'm still expecting official approvals Jan 8 – 10. I also think the gap between approval orders and actual trading will be measured in days — not weeks https://t.co/zEVGXePlTA “My view is in line with @EleanorTerrett’s reporting.

2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2024-01-05 12:00:00+00:00,Experts Anticipate SEC’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Between January 8th-10th,https://blockzeit.com/experts-anticipate-secs-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-between-january-8th-10th/,"All eyes have been on the SEC this week in anticipation for a spot bitcoin ETF approval, however, some industry heavyweights believe it’s till next week. Big names like Bloomberg’s James Seyffart, Nate Geraci, and Fox’s Eleanor Terret all lean towards a next week approval, especially between Jan. 8th and 10th. One of the major reasons why industry titans are confident about the ETF approvals being next week is that the SEC was still in meetings with issuers as of Jan. 3, trying to round up with comments on the 19b-4s.  “????SCOOP: The @SECGov is holding meetings today with the exchanges (@Nasdaq, @CBOE, @NYSE) to finalize comments on the 19b-4s submitted by the $BTC Spot ETF issuers.” said Fox’s Eleanor Terret on X. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas has been one of the strongest believers in the spot Bitcoin ETF approval. He believes the SEC isn’t necessarily delaying or planning to deny the filings, but making finishing touches on issuers’ 19b-4s leading up to an imminent approval. “Things you prob don’t do if you going to deny or delay. Hearing similar btw, and why why when we see updated (final) 19b-4s roll in that is sign approval imminent as SEC has been doing back and forth w issuers offline to perfect their 19b-4s vs doing numerous refilings a la S-1s,” wrote Balchunas on X. Terret reported that inside sources “close to the SEC could begin notifying issuers of approval on Friday with trading beginning as early as next week.” “ETF analysts and issuers alike remain confident that a favorable decision from the SEC will be made on or before Jan. 10, as the SEC continues to meet with key players on the matter.” added Terret. Nate Geraci of ETF Store also highlighted Terret’s report above in a screenshot format, in agreement that the SEC will roll out spot Bitcoin ETF approval notifications late this week and that trading should begin next week. Similarly, Bloomberg’s James Seyffart’s views on the approval timeline align with Terret’s reporting. Unlike earlier analyses about the trading timeline being weeks from approval, he believes the issuers are ready to start trading next week within days of approval. “My view is in line with @EleanorTerrett’s reporting. I think the SEC could begin signaling to issuers to expect approvals tho I’m still expecting official approvals Jan 8 – 10. I also think the gap between approval orders and actual trading will be measured in days — not weeks,” said Seyffart on X."
2024-01-05 10:00:00+00:00,Dylan LeClair: “MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Play Is The Most Misunderstood Story In Corporate Finance”,https://blockzeit.com/dylan-leclair-microstrategys-bitcoin-play-is-the-most-misunderstood-story-in-corporate-finance/,"MicroStrategy has remained the top Bitcoin accumulator in the corporate world. While other big businesses shy away from openly investing in this digital gold, MicroStrategy has been vocal about it. Bitcoin analyst, Dylan LeClair, in an interview on CNBC, explained that the corporate world does not understand MicroStrategy’s plan to keep investing in Bitcoin, even though the plan has been successful so far. This interview comes just days after MicroStrategy bought an additional 14,620 BTC for $615 million, bringing their total Bitcoin holdings to 189,150 BTC. This stash’s value currently stands at $8.11 billion. Microstrategy has had a staggering success just because Michael Saylor decided to go the way of Bitcoin. He believes that Bitcoin is the most salable money across time and space. The software and data intelligence company was only valued at $1 billion in 2020, but over three years of consistently investing in Bitcoin, the valuation has skyrocketed up to $11 billion. On December 27, 2023, MicroStrategy shares (MSTR) hit a new yearly high of $624.78 after the news of their latest Bitcoin purchase broke on the internet.MSTR soared 337% in 2023, outshining NVIDIA, Meta, and many other native American companies.  As of the market close on January 4, 2023, MSTR was trading at $685.15 per share, an 8.48% increase in the past 24 hours. The most profitable company in the world since the COVID-19 pandemic was Tesla, whose current market capitalization is 756.36 billion . If MicroStrategy keeps on increasing its stash before the bull market begins, it is possible it can topple Tesla before this bull cycle is over.Tesla. In the thick of the bear market (2022), Tesla offloaded the bulk of its Bitcoin holdings but CEO Elon Musk said the decision was not a “verdict” on the digital currency. Tesla revealed it offloaded approximately 75% of its Bitcoin between April 1 and the end of June. Now that Tesla is largely out of the Bitcoin game, MicroStrategy’s BTC accumulation plan might just be the play that makes Michael Saylor the market mover. MSTR share price is expected to go up as Bitcoin popularity increases, especially after the Bitcoin ETF is approved."
2024-01-05 07:45:11+00:00,Market Wrap: BTC Double Top Morphs Into A Consolidation Pattern As Bitcoin ETF Fever Reaches Peak,https://blockzeit.com/btc-in-a-consolidation-pattern-as-bitcoin-etf-fever-reaches-peak/,"Everyone’s eyes are peeled at the BTC chart days to what could be the approval of the long-awaited Bitcoin Spot ETF. The price of BTC is $43,642.60 today, representing a 1.18% price increase in the last 24 hours and a 2.20% price increase in the past 7 days. January 10, 2024, remains the best possible date for a Bitcoin ETF approval, can BTC price hit $50,000 before then? Let’s find out Bitcoin price, along with its dominance has risen since last week. From 47%, BTC dominance now stands at 49.1%. The market cap is up by over $20 billion, signifying growth and increased activity around the digital asset. Last week, Bitcoin formed a potential double bottom, but since it was not complete, there were chances it could morph into a ranging pattern or Rally-base-Rally kind of pattern. Only time will tell. BTC remained above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, never once nearing or even touching them.  Overall market sentiment for Bitcoin remained bullish and the greed levels did not spill into extreme greed – which is a sell signal. For the most part a ranging pattern is better off than a double top. While a ranging pattern can break out in either direction, usually, the trend breaks out in prevailing direction of the market before the price action goes into consolidation. In this case, that would be up. This ranging pattern sets the chart up for a move to the $50,000 mark. The longet the range, the higher the breakout. Think of a slingshot, the further you pull it back the further the stone will fly out.  If a Bitcoin spot ETF does get approved on January 10, 2024, we could see Bitcoin hit $50,000. However, BTC may not go back to its previous all time high price, at least not before halving.The market manipulators makers could bring the price back to $30,000 to $33,000 area in the weeks before halving. 2024 is an interesting year, and the congregation of events this are extremely rare. We shall see $48,000 BTC in January, and we shall taste $30,000 before halving. Plan your portfolio accordingly.

2024-01-04 11:42:02+00:00,Is the Bitcoin Spot ETF Already Priced In?,https://blockzeit.com/is-the-bitcoin-spot-etf-already-priced-in/,"With the decision on the Bitcoin spot ETF looming, investors are wondering whether the ETF’s approval is already priced in. This determination will influence expectations of a price rally, a drop, or a sideways movement upon the decision. The recent gains of Bitcoin over the past few months seem to suggest a “Yes.” Bitcoin’s price has nearly doubled since October. However, the impact of an actual approval on Bitcoin prices remains unclear. Questions such as “How much money will actually flow into the market?”, “Will other institutions follow?”, and “Will this legitimize crypto?” are being vividly discussed on social media. Also, it’s worth considering how much of this rally is attributable to the upcoming Bitcoin halving in April this year. An event that in previous years has always led to a strong increase in Bitcoin price. Also read: Uh-Oh, SEC’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Could Be Delayed To January 15th  In a poll we launched on Twitter, our community appeared split on whether the Bitcoin ETF is already priced into the current Bitcoin price. Approximately 46% of the Blockzeit Twitter followers believe it is, while 54% think it is not. Is the #BitcoinETF priced in already?#Bitcoin Experts and analysts appear to be equally torn. Many see the ETF as a game-changer that could change Bitcoin forever, making it mainstream and attracting a wave of new investors. The involvement of big players like BlackRock only adds to this anticipation, suggesting that the approval might be just around the corner. However, some voices in the crypto and traditional finance community advise caution. They argue that the market may have already adjusted to the possibility of an ETF, and warn against expecting a big surge in price. Gabor Gurbacs, adviser at VanEck, for example believes that the initial impact of the Bitcoin ETF is being overrated by the market. However, Gurbacs also notes that the longterm effect of ETFs are usually underestimated. In my view, people tend to overestimate the initial impact of U.S. Bitcoin ETFs. I think maybe a few $100mm flows (mostly recycled) money.Long term, people tend to underestimate the impact of spot Bitcoin ETFs. If history is any guide, gold is worth studying as a parallel. https://t.co/6vvkA9aC09 In conclusion, as the decision on the Bitcoin spot ETF comes closer, the market remains in a state of suspense. Only time will tell whether this event will be a transformative moment for Bitcoin or a milestone already reflected in its price. Also read: What Happens If Spot Bitcoin ETF Is Not Approved?"

Balchunas replied to crypto analyst Markus Thielen’s tweet about a “contrarian stance” predicting a possible rejection of all the Bitcoin ETF applications. Amidst the industry-wide anticipation of a positive outcome on the BTC ETF applications, Markus Thielen of 10xresearch.co begs to differ.  “Despite the widespread anticipation of SEC approval, our contrarian stance asserts that all proposals must catch up to a crucial requirement, possibly leading to rejection for ALL Bitcoin Spot ETF applicants in January,” wrote Thielen. Balchunas replied to Thielen’s tweet, trying to ascertain whether Thielen based his prediction off a trusted or inside source, or even the SEC itself. “Hi Markus saw the “rejection” prediction just curious are you basing this off any sourcing (eg issuers or inside the SEC) or is it more just your opinion/take on things? Thanks,” said Balchunas. Balchunas also stated that he’s heard nothing indicative of anything but approval. According to him, Thielen seemed to be pro- Bitcoin-ETF-approval, but changed his stance on the ETF approval all of a sudden. “People tagging me like crazy on this “rejection” report. We have heard nothing to indicate anything but approval but I want to give the guy benefit of doubt so I’m asking if he has any sources or if he just speculating. He seems to be bitcoin bull and recently tweeted “executives” said approval likely. So unsure why he flipped.” The renowned Bloomberg ETF analyst also took a swipe at Matrixport in another tweet citing the crypto platform’s conflicting statements on spot ETF approval and rejection – all within the same day (Jan. 2). Matrixport made two posts – “Bitcoin Spot ETF approval imminent, BTC to jump to $50,000” and “Why the SEC will REJECT Bitcoin Spot ETFs Again ” which have raised so much speculation in the industry. Reacting to the contradictory statements, Balchunas said; “Looks like the Matrix Report took both the blue pill and the red pill..” BTC crashed from 45K to 40K in just two hours today based on rumors of possible spot ETF rejections. The king of cryptocurrencies is gradually retracing its way up and currently at $42,500 as of this writing."
2024-01-04 06:00:00+00:00,"Grayscale, JPMorgan And Goldman Sachs In Talk For Bitcoin ETF Role",https://blockzeit.com/grayscale-jpmorgan-and-goldman-sachs/,"As the deadline approaches, Grayscale Investments is reportedly in discussion with both Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan regarding their potential role in a spot Bitcoin ETF. On January 4th, anonymous sources revealed that Grayscale Investment had talks with both firms regarding the proposed  ETF role. According to the source, Grayscale wants to play a vital role in the creation and redemption of spot Bitcoin ETF shares once approved by the SEC. However, both JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are considered authorized participants (AP) in the same role that Grayscale wants to vie for. This development follows a week when Grayscale Investment submitted its S-1 application without specifying its authorized participant. Being an authorized participant allows institutions to facilitate the creation of ETF shares by exchanging them for the underlying assets, in this case, Bitcoin. Additionally, the AP is also authorized to conduct ETF price tracking on the asset and provide liquidity. However, reports suggest that Goldman Sachs was previously in discussion with Blackrock to secure an authorized participant position. It took over ten years, but we’re finally on the verge of having spot bitcoin ETFs approved in the USA.(Yes, we are.)Many deserve credit for this milestone, but chiefly @Grayscale and its lawyers, who had the guts to fight this out in court and won.Let’s fight more in 2024. Blackrock had mentioned JPMorgan and Jane Street as its authorized participants in its S-1 application in its ETF proposal. Additionally, JPMorgan had mentioned Jane Street has its AP, but there is a chance of Goldman Sachs joining the bigger Jane Street that has been awarded the AP role for various firms. Recent interactions with the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and several ETF proposal candidates have sparked optimism about the approval of the ETF. Moreover, the ETF issuers and the crypto community are hopeful that the deadline set by the SEC will bring a positive outcome. With the ongoing search for regulatory approval of the ETF, approval is set to catalyze the crypto market. We might witness a breakthrough where traditional investors in the United States might have a chance to participate in trading Bitcoin without directly owning it. What impact will the BTC ETF have on the price of the cryptocurrency?The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is currently hovering around $42k. Analysts agree that the approval of a spot BTC ETF would make it easier for institutional and traditional retail investors to invest in Bitcoin.… pic.twitter.com/XZbs4zA89s Although the SEC has never approved Spot Bitcoin ETFs, the involvement of various traditional financial institutions like Blackrock, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan shows acceptance of these digital assets. Besides, it shows the evolving and mature market for cryptocurrencies. Additionally, spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchanged on established stock exchanges; therefore, they will bring robust liquidity to the Bitcoin market. This will make it easier for institutional investors to enter and exit the market without serious price volatility."
2024-01-03 14:00:00+00:00,What Happens If Spot Bitcoin ETF Is Not Approved?,https://blockzeit.com/what-if-spot-bitcoin-etf-is-not-approved/,"The deadline is closing in for the SEC to either approve or deny the spot Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin has performed impressively in the last 50 days. With speculation that ETF approval is set to occur on January 10, the price has witnessed an impressive soar. Although the chances of spot Bitcoin ETF approval are high, there could be a pull rug of the decade by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the approval. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas stated that the chances of rejection of ETF are 10%, citing that the regulatory body may have a lot of paperwork regarding ETFs. Although the speculation of ETF approval is at 90%, the 10% chance includes both denial and approval scenarios. The crypto market has embraced the idea of ETF approval by the United States Security and Exchange Commission on January 10 or even past the initial date. On the other hand, we should consider the bitter truth of the SEC rejecting the approval of the spot-Bitcoin ETF and what will happen to the price of the asset. It is not a surprise that the SEC might reject the ETF approval; the chances are likely to be there. Eric Bulchanus, an ETF analyst, said that with the amount of effort and time put in by Bitcoin ETF issuers and the SEC, it is unlikely that ETF would be rejected. Matrixport’s latest report released a rare view that the SEC will reject all Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, and final approval may be achieved in the Q2. It also predicts that the price of Bitcoin will fall to 36,000 to 38,000, and recommended that investors buy put options or… Looking back at 2017, Cameroon and Tyler Winklevoss first proposed the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. This was an exchange-traded fund that was created to open up Bitcoin to investors and institutional investors. Despite the thinking proposal, the SEC rejected the proposal on March 17, 2017. At the time, Bitcoin was at $1,400 and had dropped significantly by 30% to $900. The analyst believes that if the ETF is not approved, the price of Bitcoin will face a bearish trend, and the target is estimated to be below the $30,000 level. If spot bitcoin ETF not approved in January, might be one of bigger rug pulls in crypto history…Not my base case, but can’t entirely rule out given history here (which is why I said *close* to 100%).That said, sticking w/ my original pre-Grayscale court victory prediction. https://t.co/zhlLDgMlzw Analyst Nate Geraci on X (Twitter) said, “If the SEC rejects the approval of the spot-Bitcoin ETF, the crypto market will witness the biggest rug pull in history.” If the SEC does not approve the spot Bitcoin ETF, it will be a knockdown to the crypto market. The ETF is viewed as a milestone of acceptance by traditional institutions and is set to increase traffic in the market. Rejecting ETF will bring substantial drag to the crypto market, which will affect the rest of crypto assets like Ethereum, Dogecoin, and MemeCoins. On Tuesday, Bitcoin was struggling to hit the $46,000 mark before the selling pressure lowered the price below the $45,000 mark. However, the bulls this morning tried fighting the market and soared the price of the asset above the $45k mark, but the asset is currently trading at $44,088 at the time of writing."
2024-01-03 12:57:27+00:00,Bitcoin Flash-Crash: BTC-Price Crashes to $40k On ETF-Rejection Rumors,https://blockzeit.com/the-fud-has-started-bitcoin-price-crashes-to-40k-on-bitcoin-etf-rejection-rumors/,"The FUD has begun. The Bitcoin price briefly fell to $40,000 from the previous level of $45,500. The drop was based on the rumor that the SEC will reject all Bitcoin Spot ETF applications. The price has since recovered and now lies at $42,700. Here is what happened. The rumor started with a report by an analyst of Matrixport, who predicted that ALL ETF applications will be rejected in January. This is, however, just a prediction, with no actual proof. This is the “reason” for the dump. I put reason in quotes, because this is really just a leverage flush. Regardless, this is an OPINION with zero new information that flies in the face of everything shared by experts. Are you guys that skittish? pic.twitter.com/inqMvPrb8r The entire crypto market fell upon this news, with $BTC dumping by $5k within a few minutes. This is the first time such a huge dump is happening since Bitcoin bottomed at $15k. A total of $500 million in long positions have been liquidated. Here is how the market reacted: WHO IS DUMPING #BITCOIN?? pic.twitter.com/mzKHzrSjPY With the decision of the SEC being only days if not hours away, we will be witnessing more FUD and market volatility. The likelihood of a Bitcoin Spot ETF approval, however, still is very high. Bloomberg ETF analyst, EricBalchunas, gives a +90% chance of approval due to a number of factors, especially the SEC’s significant change in behaviour by way of engaging with applicants and providing them with guidance on updating their applications."
2024-01-03 12:00:00+00:00,"Uh-Oh, SEC’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Could Be Delayed To January 15th",https://blockzeit.com/secs-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval/,"News came in during the New Year celebration that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may decide on the pending spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) as early as January 2 or 3. With no news coming in as of this writing, there’s speculation that it may be delayed by a week. The SEC has an ultimatum to lay down its verdict on the spot Bitcoin ETF filing of ARK Invest’s ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF by January 10, 2024. With the recent fast-tracking of the process and the hard deadline it set for amendments in the filing of all parties involved last December 29, 2023, the consensus has more reason to believe that the regulator may be aiming to nail its ruling for everyone within the said period. The mass approval could also help level the field for all players like what ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood pointed out in the past. Thanks to Polymarket, a decentralized events prediction market, there’s now a wedge in the public’s optimism. According to a new event on the platform, spot Bitcoin ETFs could get the nod from the SEC by January 15. As of press time, an average of 85% of the people there are wagering on this possibility. This represents over 60% change in the perception of users within the past month. A postponement by a week is still a positive development in Bitcoin and the overall crypto market. However, there’s a psychological deadline created by the mass media that we might see approvals between January 8 to 10. Missing out on this date could feed the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) claiming that the SEC, in cahoots with its favored institutions, may push back or deny applications initially to orchestrate the biggest rug pull masterminded by the government in history. They say this way, the US government and its alleged cronies in companies like BlackRock could scoop in more supply of Bitcoin before the eventual approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. If spot bitcoin ETF not approved in January, might be one of bigger rug pulls in crypto history…Not my base case, but can’t entirely rule out given history here (which is why I said *close* to 100%).That said, sticking w/ my original pre-Grayscale court victory prediction. https://t.co/zhlLDgMlzw As I mentioned, however, this bleak scenario painted by the likes of the ETF Store President Nate Geraci would be tantamount to SEC shooting itself in the foot. It will be career suicide for all the people involved, especially for SEC Chair Gary Gensler, because the ensuing pandemonium will certainly earn them the ire of Congress. Not to mention that it could also result in a potential lawsuit from ARK Invest, whose filing is already due on January 10th."

The firm had previously stated that part of the funds would be used to acquire more bitcoin. On January 2, Saylor announced, while filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, that he had already started selling the firm’s stock. He sold 315,000 stock options, granted to him on April 4, 2014. According to the filing, Michael Saylor began selling his first 5,000 shares on January 2nd, planning to sell his option award between January 2nd and April 25th. During the third quarter of the 2023 call, Michael Saylor announced that he would be selling 5,000 of the firm’s shares on a trading day for the next four months. This was first disclosed in that quarter’s 10-Q filing, indicating that he could sell up to 400,000 shares of his vested options through April 26. Michael Saylor mentioned during the call that “The move would allow him to address his “personal obligations” and, of course, buy more Bitcoin.” He went on to state that his equity in the company remains significant despite his sales. @saylor during the $MSTR fourth-quarter conference call confirming he’s exercising MicroStrategy options to buy more #bitcoin personally: pic.twitter.com/VRbC06VX5U MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, owning 189,000 bitcoins in its treasure after its last purchase in December, valued at $8.54 billion at the current price. In the previous year, Bitcoin recorded an impressive growth of 170%; however, MicroStrategy outperformed the asset by almost three times, recording 411% growth since the beginning of 2023. As the January 10 deadline approaches, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) may take more time to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, claiming that they still have a lot of paperwork to go through. The cryptocurrency community is speculating that the announcement will come late this week or early next week. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, ETF rejection by the SEC might come differently. He said, “While it is unlikely, there is still a chance that the SEC could hand down the rug pull of the decade.” New Research note from me today. We still believe 90% chance by Jan 10 for spot #Bitcoin ETF approvals. But if it comes earlier we are entering a window where a wave of approval orders for all the current applicants *COULD* occur pic.twitter.com/u6dBva1ytD Balchunas went on and announced on the X (formerly known as Twitter) that “we haven’t gone further than 90% due to the possibility of the SEC delivering a significant decision. While he doesn’t think there will be a full denial, he adds that the 10% chance includes both approval and denial scenarios. "
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."

Recently, he reaffirmed his bullish stance on the world’s premier cryptocurrency by market cap. JUST IN: Jim Cramer says on CNBC ""you can't kill"" #Bitcoin and ""it is here to stay."" pic.twitter.com/uhWoyE1wSF Exactly a year ago, Jim Cramer blasted Bitcoin as it was seemingly gearing up to retake the $20,000 mark. The Mad Money host said he and others are not buying into the bullish reversal of BTC and recommended viewers to bet on gold instead. Cramer advised people to “ignore crypto cheerleaders” and place their money on gold as it’s a “real hedge.” He also claimed that Bitcoin is neither an accepted currency nor a reliable financial instrument for store of value. Before that, he reportedly sold his Bitcoin holdings in 2021 when prices started going downhill amid China’s crackdown on crypto. Then he reiterated his contrarian position in the onset of the Sam Bankman-Fried trial when he commented, “Mr. Bitcoin is about to go down big.” In November though, the former hedge fund manager went through a redemption arc in the crypto community. During that period, he shifted his allegiances by telling people that he was wrong about selling Bitcoin. “Look, if you like Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin,” Cramer stated in the November 22 episode of Mad Money. “That has always been my view.” “And for a while, I liked it, and I decided that money had been made, but I was premature,” Cramer admitted. The media personality mentioned he “made a lot of money” from his BTC investment, too. Fast-forward to the arrival of 2024, Cramer is now bullish on the prospects of Bitcoin as it recaptured the $45,000 range for the first time since April 2022. His optimism on the digital asset comes ahead of the expected mass approval of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of all pending spot Bitcoin ETF. “This thing, you can’t kill it,” Cramer told his CNBC co-host David Faber. “Bitcoin is a technological marvel and I think people need to start recognizing it’s here to stay.” Cramer even went on to name-drop the late Charlie Munger who famously referred to Bitcoin as “rat poison.” The host remarked that the associate of Warren Buffet “was blind to this.” Despite his bullish forecast on Bitcoin, Cramer held back a bit as he cautioned viewers that not everyone who is going long on the cryptocurrency may keep their position longer. He warned of a potential “sell the news” event following the flurry of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals."

Moreover, this could lead to a surge in demand for Bitcoin from both investors and retailers. The SEC has rejected several spot Bitcoin ETF applications; however, this approval is set to make the access to cryptocurrency more accessible to investors.

2024-01-02 12:00:00+00:00,Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Could Come In As Early As January 2,https://blockzeit.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-could-come-in-as-early-as-january-2/,"New developments in the spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange traded funds (ETFs) saga suggest that their approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could come as early as January 2. According to reports, the SEC may start giving the green light on spot Bitcoin ETF filings today or by tomorrow. This would allow the companies involved to iron out their launch by next week. The schedule will likely follow the timeframe forecasted by analysts like James Seyffart between January 8 to 10. The regulator already laid down a hard deadline for the final revision of all spot Bitcoin ETF filings last December 29. And with everyone playing ball with the agency’s preferred in-cash redemption model for the new financial instruments, the projected dates couldn’t be farther from the truth. Bitcoin just crossed the $45,000 threshold just after the New Year’s festivities. These numbers were last seen in March 2022 as BTC dived all the way to $15,000 that year. As of this writing at 10:00 AM UTC, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap soared by over 7% in the 24-chart as it sits at $45,679. The rally has also triggered a whopping 98% increase in the transaction volume of the cryptocurrency within that period as $30.86 billion of the digital asset moved between crypto wallets and exchanges. The market cap of Bitcoin now lies at $894.74 billion, thanks to the surge. During that timeframe, the coin went from a low of $42,594 to a high of $45,899. The present pricing notably squeezes down the gap between the current values of Bitcoin and its all-time high of $68,789 in November 2021 by 33%. The rising numbers have dragged other cryptocurrencies upwards, too. Among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, Solana (SOL) had the most gains as it jumped more than 12% followed by Avalanche (AVAX) by 10% in the daily chart. We are still keeping our radar on the companies that will get the SEC’s favor. It should be noted, however, that BlackRock, VanEck, Bitwise, Fidelity, Invesco, WisdomTree, Valkyrie, Ark Invest, and Grayscale have all complied with the needed revisions within the regulator’s posted deadline. Companies such as Bitwise, Hashdex, and VanEck have launched their spot Bitcoin ETF ads already within the past two weeks, which signals their strong optimism for the approval of their applications. Or this could also mean that, just maybe, they already know something that we have yet to figure out."

So, one of the easiest ways to bait crypto fans into entrusting their hard-earned holdings is by linking their scheme to him, or worse, using his likeness in an elaborate deepfake video. Michael Saylor says, “send me your Bitcoin and I’ll double it” in this YT ad.#AI deep fakes are going to get out of control here real quick. pic.twitter.com/MQ6pI3ANUF An ad showing the former MicroStrategy CEO has been circulating on YouTube leading up to the holidays. It featured Saylor inside an office enticing viewers to bite into his offer of doubling their Bitcoin holdings. From there, he enumerated the “easy steps” they can undertake to grow their wealth starting by scanning the QR code in the presentation. It sounds too good to be true, isn’t it? That’s because it probably is. People familiar with deepfake and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies immediately outed the video as a scam. Upon closer examination, one will notice right away that the actions of Saylor there seem to be off. His head and eye movements also appear to be in a loop while his head looks like it’s superimposed on a stationary body. What’s more alarming about the whole affair was that it was an advertisement approved by YouTube! We can no longer find the original video on the streaming platform, but some people on X claimed it was from the same person who perpetrated the bogus commercial in November featuring a fake rendering of Ripple CEO Brad Garlington. Like the Saylor promo, the Garlington ad encouraged viewers to send at least 1,000 XRP to a certain address so it will be doubled. Again, the same hints would tell us that the video was made employing a deepfake and AI combo. As expected, people were livid about the fake Saylor ad. Most of the heat was directed to YouTube for even approving the ad in the first place. Others suspected that someone at the website may be getting paid for the approval of the phony commercials, and they questioned their often slow response to these issues. As a result, some urged Saylor to sue the website for the personal damages he incurred because of the platform’s failure to implement its terms and conditions. They said it would be an easy win for the MicroStrategy chair. Few commented that those who send their crypto to the addresses provided by the scams probably deserve to lose their holdings so they will learn their lesson."
2024-01-02 04:00:00+00:00,Bitcoin Just Popped The $45K Mark,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-just-popped-the-45k-mark/,"Just like that, Bitcoin (BTC) popped the $45K line on the chart in the aftermath of the New Year celebrations. What a great way to start 2024! Bitcoin greeted 2024 with a bang as it crossed the $45,000 range, which was a price not seen since March 2022. As of this writing at 2:00 AM UTC on Tuesday, January 2, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap is trading at $44,943. It’s currently up by around 5% in the 24-hour chart and its transaction volume also soared by 38% as $23.08 billion of the digital asset was traded within the frame. During this period, BTC journeyed from a low of $42,214 to a high of $45,004.58. The crypto is still a long way from its all-time high of $68,789 back in November 2021 but it’s gradually narrowing the gap towards that number by 35%. Zooming out the graphs shows Bitcoin rising by over 3% within a week, 16% within a month, and a whopping 170% within a year. The key narratives responsible for the rising optimism in Bitcoin are the upcoming decision of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on all pending spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) this month. There’s also the BTC halving event happening in April. Based on how it is fast-tracking everything, the SEC may be on its way to approving all spot Bitcoin ETF applications between January 5 to 10 this year. The consensus seems to be banking on a favorable ruling by the regulator as some of them have already pulled the trigger for the ads of these new financial instruments in the US. Among the first to fire up their spot Bitcoin ETF commercials were Bitwise, Hashdex, and VanEck. Next in line is the Bitcoin halving occurring each time its network mines 210,000 blocks, which is equivalent to four years each cycle. The premier blockchain will catalyze the fourth halving at the 740,000th block sometime in April. When it eventually takes place, Bitcoin mining difficulty will be increased while the reward is lowered from the current 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. We don’t know for sure how the halving will affect BTC prices but supply and demand dynamics dictate that the resulting scarcity will bump the figures up. Helping the bullish outlook is the gradual shift of traditional financial institutions regarding Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and other forms of digital assets. Countries that have strongly opposed them have begun displaying a swerve in their policies, too. Bitcoin is long way past its rough patch in 2022, too. Thanks to the collapse of high-profile cryptocurrency projects and companies, regulatory uncertainties, and major lawsuits, it went on a crypto winter until late last year."
2024-01-01 16:00:00+00:00,VanEck Director Says The Impact Of Spot Bitcoin ETF May Have Been Overestimated,https://blockzeit.com/vaneck-spot-bitcoin-etf-impact/,"VanEck Director for Digital Assets Strategy Gabor Gurbacs thinks people may have been overestimating the potential impact of the launch of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the US. With that, it may come as a letdown when the sky-high expectations will not be initially met. On the other hand, he advises everyone not to underestimate their long-term effect. Gurbacs tried to quell the skyrocketing prospects centering on the short-term effects of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US in an X post. The VanEck director explained that, at most, only $100 million in net inflows from “mostly recycled money” could be unleashed by the institutions involved. Gurbacs expressed a more bullish perspective on their long-term influence on BTC prices instead. He used gold ETFs as an example to illustrate the possible short- and long-term outcomes of spot Bitcoin ETFs in BTC prices. The VanEck analyst pointed out that when gold ETFs were introduced by State Street in 2004, their effects were barely noticeable in gold prices. Eight years past their launch, however, gold climbed from $400 to $1,800 while its market cap surged from $2 trillion to $10 trillion. Gurbacs believes Bitcoin may follow gold’s course in relation to its spot ETFs. The only difference is that BTC may achieve new heights “much faster” because of its already known supply limit and halving events, which emphasizes BTC’s scarcity. The approval of a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF may create $ Trillions in value.On November 18, 2004, the SPDR (State Street) Gold ETF (GLD) was introduced.In the subsequent 8 years gold’s price quadrupled+ from $400 to $1,800 adding ~$8 Trillion in market cap going from ~$2 Trillion… pic.twitter.com/eE5vasJwV5 Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart chimed in on the prediction of Gurbacs’ in agreement. He said the public is too focused on the excessive projections of spot Bitcoin ETFs that it may come as a letdown when their soaring expectations will not be realized. Due to this, they tend to overlook the long-term impact it brings to the table. Mostly in agreement with Gabor on this. Consensus seems to be (anecdotally) that People are focused on a massive short term impact that I think could be a bit of a let down while at same time not fully appreciating the potential longer term impacts. https://t.co/z69Wbffcu9 According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website, VanEck just updated its spot Bitcoin ETF application on Friday. The amendment ditches the in-kind redemption model in favor of an in-cash system following the regulator’s earlier recommendation. It also mentions Coinbase as the company’s custodian for its new financial instrument. At the same time, VanEck released its spot Bitcoin ETF ad, which indicates its strong optimism towards its filing’s approval by the SEC. This comes hot on the heels of similar commercials by its rivals Bitwise and HashDex nearly two weeks ago.

2024-01-01 06:00:00+00:00,Is Bitcoin Halal Or Haram: A Salafist Cleric Gives A Definitive Answer,https://blockzeit.com/is-bitcoin-halal-or-haram/,"Since Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies went mainstream, there has been a debate centering on whether or not it was allowed in the Islamic faith. Recently, a 90-year-old Saudi Salafic cleric laid down what could be the most definitive answer to this debate. NEW: 90 year-old Saudi Salafic cleric writes a Fatwa deeming #Bitcoin acceptable under Islam 👀 pic.twitter.com/DNGduIuMAm Although the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been instrumental in expanding the reach of cryptocurrencies and exchanges, there have been arguments among some Islamic scholars if these digital assets are indeed “halal” or “haram.” Many of us may have already encountered these two familiar words, especially the former, in various product packaging or other forms of goods but some may not have a full idea of what they really mean. For the unfamiliar, halal means “permissible” while haram means “forbidden” under Islamic law. These form the guiding principles of the faithful to ensure that they are acting, consuming, or practicing other activities in accordance with the standards of morality. Some Sharia experts used to argue that crypto is haram because many of them are not based on real commodities or have speculative values. Investing and trading them were also likened to high-stakes casino gambling. However, other Sharia law experts like Mufti Muhammad Abu Bakar, Manager of Shariah Operations at Minhaj Advisory in Dubai, firmly believe cryptocurrencies similar to Bitcoin are halal when they are used as a payment system or as “zakat” — a donation required from a Muslim based on their wealth or savings. They are permissible as well when they are based on Sharia-compliant projects. To finally put the status of Bitcoin to rest, Saudi Salafic cleric Adbul Rahman Nasser Al-Barrack recently issued a “fatwa” or verdict on the official status of the digital asset based on the traditional Islamic faith. The 90-year-old cleric’s issuance started with an admission that Bitcoin may have been once considered unacceptable but he is now reversing that view. A direct translation of what the Saudi Salafi cleric says, “…what makes it[Bitcoin] more likely to say that it is permissible – in my opinion – is that as long as this currency has a cover from the one who issued it, it is acceptable.” “Because then they resemble checks issued with divided amounts on a balance in a known account,” it adds. The fatwa also pushes for discussion of Bitcoin’s expanded adoption. However, he reminds his subjects that similar to paper money or fiat, the digital asset must not be utilized for usury and it should be required for zakat."
2024-01-01 04:00:00+00:00,How Will The 2024 Bitcoin Halving Affect BTC Prices?,https://blockzeit.com/2024-bitcoin-halving-effect-on-btc-prices/,"Bitcoin (BTC) like gold flourishes because of its decentralized, permissionless, limited, and censorship-resistant traits. But unlike the precious metal, the digital asset’s finite supply is known. As we approach another halving on its way to its cap of 21 million BTC, we are now feeling its increasing scarcity. Each halving increases Bitcoin mining difficulty and reduces the rewards by half. So, it not only changes the way the coin’s ecosystem operates but it also serves as a reminder of its exclusivity. With that, each event has historically catalyzed massive bull runs. According to eToro, it takes an average of 10 minutes to mine a block on the Bitcoin blockchain, which rewards the miner 6.25 BTC. Given these numbers, around 144 blocks are mined daily, which generates 900 new BTC. Normally, miners don’t keep all their haul because they have to sell some of their BTC to cover their expenses. These sell-offs drive down BTC prices from time to time. However, the upcoming halving may change the way Bitcoin miners operate. Due to mining rewards getting slashed in half, the overall Bitcoin mined per day will be reduced to 450 BTC by April 2024. The resulting scarcity leading to a surge in BTC prices could reduce the selling pressure exerted by miners. So, the next cycle could lead to unprecedented valuations for the digital asset. The source didn’t put in any figures in its theory but super bullish predictions by expert analysts are betting $80,000, $140,000, and even $250,000 per BTC in 2024. We’d like to clarify though that these forecasts have factored in the anticipated landmark approval of the US Securities and Exchange Commission of all pending spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) under its jurisdiction. On the other hand, there’s a possibility that Bitcoin prices will not get far from what we are witnessing now.  The proponents of this theory cite the “efficient market hypothesis” (EMH) as a basis, which argues that since the “halving is a public and predictable event,” there’s a chance that the price of the future halvings may already be reflected in prevailing prices. Let’s not discount the historical data that has consistently displayed all-new highs in Bitcoin prices at each succeeding halving cycle. But then again, the EMH theory could still play out because of the fact that more people are now aware of the nature of cryptocurrencies and have a better grasp of their inner workings such as halvings. The post warns that although there is tremendous optimism about the Bitcoin halving in relation to the digital asset’s price, investors should be on guard for potential shifts in market sentiments stemming from hype and the effects of the competition. We would like to add here the immense influence that regulations may pose to the crypto along the way."
2023-12-31 08:00:00+00:00,Are Grayscale and ARK Invest Better Positioned For A Spot Bitcoin ETF?,https://blockzeit.com/grayscale-and-ark-invest-spot-bitcoin-etf/,"There’s no doubt that the biggest powerhouses in the spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange traded fund (ETF) race are BlackRock and Fidelity. However, two other heavy hitters in the form of Grayscale and ARK Invest may have better leverage against their rivals. The radars of traditional finance (TradFi) institutions and the crypto community are all tuned on the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) right now as everyone awaits the agency’s ruling on all the pending spot Bitcoin ETF applications under its jurisdiction. Among the applicants, the entry of BlackRock and Fidelity sure made a lot of noise because of their strong foothold in the assets management sector. Grayscale and ARK Invest, however, appear to be in a better position against the other heavyweights. First of all, both institutions have been trying to get into the game years before their competitors. BlackRock came in late in the scene after a seesawing statement from its CEO, Larry Fink, about the digital asset. It should be noted that the exec once called Bitcoin “an index of money laundering” before shifting his allegiances when the cryptocurrency started taking off. But to the company’s credit, it should be noted that its spot Bitcoin ETF filing was one of the main contributors to the current bullish swing of BTC. Fidelity’s entrance came as no surprise considering that its Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer earlier commented about Bitcoin’s “unique advantage” over gold. But with the company’s founding going way back to 1946, its move served as a further reaffirmation to the growing trust of TradFi in the digital asset. For Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, Grayscale is uniquely positioned against others because all it needs is to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot ETF. Even after getting rejected by the SEC numerous times for its spot Bitcoin ETF filing, GTBC has already held around $27 billion in assets and processes $150 million worth of transactions daily. Balchunas believes that if GBTC were to be converted into a spot Bitcoin ETF and launched in its current version, it would immediately capture the top 1% of the market. So, to keep a “level-playing-field” for the participants, SEC will likely nerf Grayscale right out of the gate to prevent a “kingmaker” scenario. While AP agreements could keep some from starting gate, that won't be problem for Grayscale. Their issue is a special one and it is the SEC not wanting to play king maker bc if they allowed to convert on Day One, they'd have massive advantage via tons of embedded aum/volume. pic.twitter.com/jGBR41WpFj Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest, on the other hand, has more than $100 million lying in wait to be unleashed once its spot Bitcoin ETF is greenlit by the SEC. Days ago, ARK closed its GBTC position as it cited “tax and regulatory uncertainties” as reasons for the pullout. After that, the funds were moved to ProShares’ Bitcoin futures ETF. Balchunas claimed that the Bitcoin futures ETF may only be a “temporary parking spot” for ARK’s funds as it awaits verdict for its spot Bitcoin ETF filing in the US. Like Grayscale, the company seems to be prepared already for the potential surge of volume and flows with its haul. “Flows and volume are crucial in the marketing of an ETF,” said the Bloomberg analyst. We predicted they'd do this a month ago.. smart imo, better to give your own ETF a nice aum boost while saving your investors on a big ann big exp ratio pic.twitter.com/YlBvKDS2dk"
2023-12-30 15:14:51+00:00,"BlackRock Names Jane Street, JP Morgan As Broker Of Choice For ETF",https://blockzeit.com/blackrock-name-jane-street-jp-morgan-as-broker-of-choice-for-etf/,"BlackRock, the U.S.-based financial institution, announced JP Morgan Securities and Jane Street as its ETF Bitcoin Broker when filing with the Securities and Exchange Commissions on Friday. Blackrock named the two institutions as brokers as the deadline for ETF approval nears in the next 10 days. Moreover, Valkyrie had also appointed Jane Street and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. for the same role should the SEC approve the spot Bitcoin ETF by January 10th.  However, JP Morgan’s appointment came as a surprise to the crypto community. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon has consistently made it clear that he does not support Bitcoin but rather sees it as a bar of gold without authority while suggesting that it should be banned. However, this move by BlackRock did not go unnoticed, although it increased its chances of getting approval from the SEC by updating its spot-Bitcoin ETF application. This move received several criticisms from various sources.  How about that @ewarren, Jamie Dimon’s @jpmorgan is involved with #Bitcoin despite its only use case serving terrorists, drug cartels and other criminals. Or maybe you and Jamie Dimon are simply gas lighting the American public. https://t.co/1dBilLTh7k However, JP Morgan and Jane Street’s choice of BlackRock is a clear move that tends to collaborate with traditional finance. Moreover, both firms are excellent players in trading and custody and major players in traditional finance. Additionally, the authorized firm has emerged as a key point of interest with ongoing talks with the SEC. Just another datapoint to update priors that we live in the clown world simulation when Jamie ""crypto should be banned"" Dimon's firm would be a leading AP on the premier spot crypto ETF. Jane Street has been picked by over 3 institutions that have filled spots for Bitcoin ETF applicants: Blackrock, Valkyrie, and Fidelity. Although Jane Street is associated with names that may cause trouble, like FTX founder Sam Bankman, the firm is among the largest market makers. This makes it the best choice for the SEC; additionally, the firm reported a portfolio worth over $300 billion. UPDATE: @ValkyrieFunds just filed another amended S-1 for their Bitcoin ETF. Anddddd they have named Jane Street and Cantor Fitzgerald as their APs. Floodgates opening. https://t.co/GKKIoAvaTy pic.twitter.com/JisXS3XxVR Despite the firm being associated with FTX Sam Bankman and Alamanda head of research Caroline Ellison, it was still the best choice, which could increase BlackRock and its rivals in ETF spot-bitcoin approval. Jane Street kept the ETF bond market liquid during the 2020 Covid crash. Therefore, Jane Street remains the best choice for SEC and Spot-Bitcoin ETF applicants. Broker-dealers serving as authorized participants for ETFs are responsible for handling the creation and redemption of baskets of shares in the fund as well as transfers of cash to and from its administrator. However, the president of ETF, Nate Geraci, stated that “lining up APs won’t exactly be a layup for every prospective issuer, so this was an important step.”"
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

This innovative platform, now in early access, is anticipated to catalyze a monumental 2000x surge, drawing significant parallels and interest from established cryptocurrency communities.  Option2Trade (O2T) is not just another entry in the crypto market; it represents a paradigm shift. With the incorporation of advanced A.I technologies and a robust exchange framework, Option2Trade (O2T) is set to redefine trading experiences. Investors from Render (RNDR), known for their cutting-edge approach to GPU-based rendering on the blockchain, see a natural ally in Option2Trade’s (O2T) tech-forward setup. Similarly, Fetch.ai (FET) backers, who are accustomed to AI-enhanced blockchain networks that optimize data-driven environments, find Option2Trade’s (O2T) vision particularly compelling. Render (RNDR) has been at the forefront of decentralized graphics rendering, transforming GPU computing power across distributed networks. The Render (RNDR) community, always on the lookout for platforms that push the technological envelope, recognizes Option2Trade (O2T) as a potential game-changer that could enhance their investment strategy, leveraging its A.I capabilities to possibly optimize rendering processes and trading scenarios alike.

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."

The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2023-12-29 10:48:26+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Forms a Double Top as January 10th Bitcoin ETF Deadline Looms,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-forms-a-double-top-as-january-10th-bitcoin-etf-deadline-looms/,"Bitcoin price has entered another correction after failing to break the $44,000 level for the second time in a row. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $42,507.00 today, representing a -1.06% price decline in the last 24 hours and a -2.60% price decline in the past 7 days. However, with the news of a possible Bitcoin ETF approval on the January 10th deadline, Bitcoin may be rising to $50,000. Here is how that is going to happen. Last week, Bitcoin price spotted a potential double top but it was not complete. There was a possibility the price would break above the previous top. The market was green for most of last week, and news of a rare SEC meeting with all Bitcoin ETF applicants may have caused optimism in the hearts of crypto investors. Bitcoin price action maintained above the 50 and 200-day moving averages, remaining bullish. However, the BTC price was rejected at the $44,000 area and started going back down, forming a potential double top. The double top that is now in formation will be complete when or if the BTC price breaks below the $41,000 mark. Otherwise, Bitcoin would have entered into a consolidation pattern, which is better than a double bottom. A ranging pattern for BTC at this time would cause the asset to oscillate between $44,000 and $41,000 for some time before the market takes a definitive direction. In case, the double top does take precedence, BTC has strong support at $39,000, and $38,000. The latter is especially strong since it is a resistance-turned-support and would make for a strong bounce area. Strategic Decision Playbook for Jan 8-10 participants.Case 1: ETF is approved, and market moves up 5K+ points. Stay put and smoke a victory cigar. More gains are coming. The Samson Mow God Candle is in play.Case2: ETF is approved, and market sells or ignores the news. Great… The SEC held a meeting with ALL BTC spot ETF applicants on December 22, 2023, and the contents of the meeting were mainly about the removal of in-kind redemptions from filings. It looks like the SEC was giving the applicants final requirements to amend their applications before the January 10th final submission deadline. It has been almost 10 years since the last approval of the first-ever filing. If a Bitcoin spot ETF is approved, coupled with the Bitcoin halving, BTC could move as high as $220,000 per coin DISCLAIMER: The work included in this article is based on current events, technical charts, company news releases, and the author’s opinions.

2023-12-29 04:00:00+00:00,"Crypto Visionary Tim Draper Expects Bitcoin To Soar, Surpassing $250,000 Mark",https://blockzeit.com/crypto-visionary-tim-draper-expects-bitcoin-to-soar-surpassing-250000-mark/,"American billion-dollar mogul and venture capitalist Timothy Draper has predicted that Bitcoin will skyrocket to a whopping $250,000 in 2024. Draper made this bold prediction while interviewing with Coin Bureau, where he said that Bitcoin hitting $250K will probably “come pretty soon” and “will go way past it” upon hitting the target. Draper had started amassing bitcoin as far back as 2014, when the cryptocurrency was relatively new and crypto in its infant stage. The venture capitalist went ahead to bid for  30,000 BTC after the Mt. Gox collapse in February 2014, after seeing the cryptocurrency display daredevil resilience regardless of the unfortunate event at the time.  The renowned venture capitalist bagged 30,000 BTC for $19 million. Fast forward to this year, the value is up over 4,000 percent and worth over 800 million. Ever since scooping this much Bitcoin, the billionaire has been vocal about the prospects of the top crypto, making a couple predictions, some of which have given him a solid reputation in the industry. In 2014 also, he predicted that Bitcoin would reach a high of $10,000 in three years, and it happened just as he said in 2017 to everyone’s amazement. Draper’s latest prediction on Bitcoin isn’t the first time he’s stood by the king of  cryptocurrencies hitting the $250K target. He had already made the forecast back in 2022 and maintained it throughout some of the biggest storms that have rocked the crypto space. After the FTX collapsed in Nov. 2022, the billionaire still maintained his faith in Bitcoin’s hitting $250K, stating that he believed “the fiasco is going to bring on a lot more Bitcoin maximalists.” He’s come under fire from critics who accused him of misleading people, seeing BTC didn’t hit the $250K mark or come close this year, but he doesn’t seem to flinch much. “The only reason I’ve given the second prediction was that the first one was so good. I had a lot of pressure to put another one out there,” speaking about why he made the prediction about Bitcoin reaching a quarter million dollars. He also blamed the US government for smothering his predictions to death and suppressing the advancement of Bitcoin. “I went on a rant. I actually said all these things. US Government is killing the golden goose of Silicon Valley. Regulations smother innovators”, said Draper. Bitcoin is up 0.19% as of this writing, according to CoinMarketCap analytics.  It is currently at $43,080, which seems to be its resistance point for the past week. All eyes look up to the SEC for a favorable decision on the spot Bitcoin ETFs, which could potentially send BTC to the moon by next year."

According to a tweet from Michael Saylor, the company’s executive chairman, the purchased bitcoin was worth $615.7 million. MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 14,620 BTC for ~$615.7 million at an average price of $42,110 per #bitcoin.

Michael Saylor has a strong belief in the long-term potential of Bitcoin. MicroStrategy has the highest holding of Bitcoin, accounting for 0.7% of the entire market capitalization. MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 5,445 BTC for ~$147.3 million at an average price of $27,053 per #bitcoin. As of 9/24/23 @MicroStrategy hodls 158,245 $BTC acquired for ~$4.68 billion at an average price of $29,582 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/GbJtUoQfXv MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor announced that he believes that cryptocurrency is the future currency; therefore, he is unwavering in his positive outlook for Bitcoin. Although the cryptocurrency market is fluctuating, he has faith in Bitcoin and the approval of the ETF, which is set to increase Bitcoin’s price in January. Bitcoin is a growing asset, and its value is seen as a hedge against inflation; therefore, institutions are taking advantage of this by investing in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency market. MicroStrategy is among the institutions that are investing in Bitcoin with the ongoing trend from different institutions. The purchase of 14,620 Bitcoin has increased the institution’s value today by 3.2% since the company announced it would consistently invest in Bitcoin as a long-term investment. The company is not slowing down; it is instead increasing its efforts and recording a value of $5.9 billion. The decision of the SEC on ETF approval might skyrocket the value of the institution if, by January 10, the decision is made in favor of cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy has been accumulating Bitcoin since 2020. Yesterday’s act shows how committed the institution is to cryptocurrency. The increase in Bitcoin price ensures the institution is kept on track, contributing heavily to the success of MicroStrategy. Moreover, analysts have an optimistic view that Bitcoin is set to go bullish. The halving of Bitcoin, which is set to cause great scarcity, and the approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF) by the SEC in the U.S. The approval of the ETF will increase investment in the cryptocurrency market. From Saylor’s perspective, it’s unwise to save in a fiat currency that is perpetually debased when he can instead put the company’s treasury in a liquid asset that doesn’t suffer from dramatic supply inflation. Additionally, Saylor believes that Bitcoin represents a form of gold, only that Bitcoin is harder, smarter, and stronger than gold. The purchase of Bitcoin marks MicroStrategy as the major holder of cryptocurrency."
2023-12-28 10:00:00+00:00,Stocks Linked To Bitcoin Rallied By 300% To 600% In 2023,https://blockzeit.com/stocks-linked-to-bitcoin/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been a success story this year as it rallied to recover its losses during the long crypto winter. In the backdrop of this surge, however, are companies linked to the premier cryptocurrency by market cap that pumped their stocks more than the digital asset. Bitcoin's 2023 rally drove some of the stock market's biggest gains this year https://t.co/VvryL5PdlX According to CNBC, the big winners this year that even trumped the 150% gain of Bitcoin were Coinbase, Microstrategy, and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. The stocks of these companies soared by 300% while Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital recorded a 688% increase. What’s more, the said businesses were among the biggest gainers in the US market. FactSet’s data revealed that the four were among the top eight performers of the year for companies with at least $5 billion market valuation. “It’s just more fuel for a fire,” commented Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz in the network’s Squawk Box interview. “Crypto stocks are trading almost like a mania.” Marathon Digital, one of the Bitcoin mining firms that BlackRock is betting on, was at the precipice of closure last year when it lost almost $400 million on its operations with only $28.4 million in sales. This came amid the falling Bitcoin prices of that period. Marathon Digital’s fortune flipped this year as it registered $64.1 million in earnings for Q3, which was a result of a $97.8 million revenue pump the prior year. Now, it’s doubling down on its operations through a $178.6 million expansion in Texas and Nebraska. The acquisition will increase the Bitcoin mining portfolio of the company by 56% while raising its capacity to 910 megawatts and hashrate to 50 EH/s within the next 18 to 24 months. “By vertically integrating, we take the profit margin for the third party out and we can run the site the way we want to run it,” said Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel. The exec also noted they are crafting contingency measures to ensure that they’re on “sound financial footing” the next time Bitcoin prices dip. It turns out that three of the four biggest gainers in Wall Street happen to be the biggest Bitcoin whales this year. Coinbase is just next to Satoshi Nakamoto in BTC holdings with a total of 947,755 BTC in its reserves and public wallets. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the largest asset manager in the world, had 643,572 BTC in its stash. Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy has been aggressively hauling Bitcoin as of late raising its supply to 189,150 BTC."

Last Wednesday, the technology firm purchased 14,620 BTC for around $615.7 million. MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 14,620 BTC for ~$615.7 million at an average price of $42,110 per #bitcoin. As of 12/26/23, @MicroStrategy now hodls 189,150 $BTC acquired for ~$5.9 billion at an average price of $31,168 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/PKfYY59sTW According to the latest post of MicroStrategy Co-Founder and Chairman Michael Saylor on X, the 14,620 BTC acquisition was made at an average price of $42,110. This takes the company’s total haul to 189,150 BTC at $5.9 billion and at an average price of $31,168 per BTC, inclusive of fees and expenses. With the present price and accumulation in the equation, the investment of MicroStrategy has already paid off by over $2 billion. This could further bubble considering that two major events are happening in the Bitcoin ecosystem next year, namely the ultimatum for the spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) filed under the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the halving. MicroStrategy started collecting Bitcoin back in August 2020 with an initial investment of $250 million. Over time, the company gradually added more to the haul until it reached the current numbers. Right now, MicroStrategy is the seventh-largest Bitcoin whale in the world. It is only next to Bitfinex in the rankings, which is estimated to possess 192,508 to 200,000 BTC. Before the latest Bitcoin purchase, MicroStrategy’s stocks went up by 327%, which pumped its market cap to $8.3 billion. In the last filing for Q3, the tech firm displayed $130 million in sales. The company was joined by other Bitcoin whales, specifically Coinbase and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. The three were also included in the top eight performers for companies valued above $5 billion. A massive pay-out is expected for these whales once the anticipated approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US finally takes place in January. Based on recent developments, the decision of the SEC could be hammered out by the 10th of that month. As of this writing at 2:00 AM UTC on Thursday, Bitcoin is trading at $43,551 with a 2.5% gain on the 24-hour chart. This takes its market cap to $852.86 billion but trading volume significantly dropped by 12.76% as only $26.25 worth of the coin moved in wallets and crypto exchanges within that frame. During this time BTC moved from a low of $42,167 to the current high. Bitcoin still has a lot of catching up to do from its $68,789 all-time high on November 10, 2021, though. However, with the super bullish projections centering on the digital asset, it may finally reclaim or even surpass that spot by next year."

Russia faced a barrage of sanctions after the nation attacked and tried to invade the neighboring Ukraine. Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Financial Market Committee was quoted stating that they plan to make legal the cross border payments using cryptocurrencies as early as the first half of 2024 “We will meet with the relevant parties again in January and discuss the regulation of cryptocurrencies. Because the cryptocurrency market in Russia is quite large. Major players involved in the mining and circulation of cryptocurrencies want this regulated; They are ready to pay taxes. Therefore, I expect cryptocurrency legislation to become law in the first half of 2024.” According to the Russian Newspaper Izvestia, the proposed regulations include penalties for the illegal use of cryptos, such as money laundering and funding criminal and terrorist activities. Cryptocurrency will be ingrained in Russia’s economic and financial system, spanning circulation, cross-border transactions, and even taxation. The adoption of BTC as a legal tender in Russia is set to happen in March or April 2024. However, discussions for the same will take place in January. Aksakov discussed the importance of Bitcoin payments and other cryptos in fostering and improving international payments during the interview.As of the time of the interview, major crypto players in Russia are in support of the regulation and do not have a problem paying taxes on their cryptocurrency revenues.  This development comes just a couple of weeks before the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF on January 10, 2024. The approval of a Bitcoin ETF could further strengthen Russia’s position on the global financial map if they are already underway with legalizing BTC."
2023-12-27 12:00:00+00:00,Exploring New Bitcoin Price Predictions Above $100K Per BTC,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-2024-predictions/,"The anticipation for the approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the US is all the talk in the crypto scene right now. One of the questions commonly raised concerning this pivotal event is how high would Bitcoin price fly once it finally happens. Citing a study by Galaxy, the Crypto Valley Journal posits that Bitcoin prices may depend on the resulting inflows. It used as a basis the behavioral data of investors from early 2018 to 2022 during the price fluctuations of BTC to establish a link between the two. Based on its estimates, there are currently $14.4 trillion worth of addressable assets in the US. With the conservative assumption that only 10% of them would invest in a spot Bitcoin ETF with an average allocation of 1%, there would be $14.4 billion in inflows in the first year. Integrating the momentum-driven model would translate to $141,000 per BTC. The caveat, however, is it will be hard to predict the resulting demand of the spot Bitcoin ETFs upon launch and after the hype surrounding them subsides. Tim Draper, a venture capitalist (VC) who is better known in the crypto community for his bold Bitcoin predictions and purchases, is keeping his $250,000 forecast per BTC. Initially, he said Bitcoin would tap those numbers this year, but it didn’t. When his target missed the deadline, he blamed the hesitance of traditional financial institutions in adopting the digital asset. Later on, he adjusted his ultimatum by two years to put his $250K price estimation for Bitcoin in 2025. In his latest interview with Coin Bureau, Draper doubled down on his projection but advanced the deadline to 2024. The VC noted the resiliency and flexibility of the Bitcoin blockchain in adopting layer 2 solutions, smart contracts, and NFTs in the form of Ordinals for his analysis. Although not expressly addressed in the interview, the nod of US regulator in Bitcoin in the form of spot ETFs based on the crypto will certainly trigger mass adoption of the coin by both retail and institutional investors—the latter whom he blamed for his missed target will be a vital factor in fulfilling his vision. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC, Bitcoin appears to be in a consolidation phase. With that, it hadn’t moved much on the 24-hour chart as it continued to tread the $42,400 line and only gone down by 0.70%. BTC only went from a $41,676 low and a $42.797 high within the timeframe. Despite the lack of notable price actions, trading volume remained at 12.19% as $27.47 billion worth of BTC moved between wallets and crypto exchanges. Right now, the market cap of Bitcoin sits at $830.68 billion and its valuation is still 38% away from its all-time high of $68,789 on November 10, 2021."

The cause of Bitcoin’s price drop is due to short-term holders; the data shows that short-term holders are moving their Bitcoin from cold wallets to exchanges.

However, BitMex co-founder Arthur Hayes warns that too much success of these instruments could prove to be detrimental to the Bitcoin ecosystem. In Hayes’ blog post on December 23 that covered a mishmash of topics ranging from his Japanese adventures to crypto, the former BitMex CEO went beyond the spot Bitcoin ETF hype train to how they would “completely destroy” Bitcoin if they become “too successful.” For the American entrepreneur, the very fabric of Bitcoin’s existence lies in its ability to be traded. That’s because when all of the digital asset’s 21 million supply cap has already been mined by 2140, the only way miners could earn from it is by validating blockchain transactions. “In essence, if Bitcoin moves, it has value,” said Hayes. “But if there was never another Bitcoin transaction between two entities, miners would be unable to afford the energy it costs to secure the network.” “As a result, they would shut off their machines,” he added. “Without the miners, the network dies, and Bitcoin vanishes.” The idea of traditional finance (TradFi) entities hoarding the digital asset in a “metaphorical vault” only to trade them via derivatives will dry up transactions according to Hayes. Eventually, the incentive of miners to keep validating transactions is diminished until they gradually move to more rewarding crypto ventures. Bitcoin getting in control of regulated investment managers would end up deconstructing its decentralized framework and it becomes just another “state-controlled financial asset.” However, Hayes envisions the entry of an alternative that would stay true to Satoshi Nakamoto’s goal in the demise of the Bitcoin blockchain. “It is beautiful when you think about it,” Hayes pondered. “If Bitcoin becomes just another state-controlled financial asset, it dies because it isn’t used.” “The people will once again have a non-state-controlled monetary asset and financial system,” the investor stated. “Hopefully, the second time around, we will learn not to hand our private keys to the baldies.” Hayes’ foresight may be too far forward in the future but crunching them down paints a bleak scenario should the Wall Street personalities whom he called “baldies” were to control Bitcoin’s supply and movements. Bitcoin currently stands at a critical point where the approval or denial of its spot ETFs could either make or break it. Right now, there is optimism that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will greenlight them by January 2024 considering how the regulator has been fast-tracking the process with hard deadlines and pushing the applicants to adopt a model that it prefers. Estimates vary as to how BTC will move past the approval of its spot ETFs, but industry players are betting $80K to $100K for the crypto. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood even laid down a super bullish forecast of $1 million per BTC on the way to 2030."
2023-12-26 04:00:00+00:00,FUD Says We May Be Heading For A Spot Bitcoin ETF Rug Pull,https://blockzeit.com/fud-spot-bitcoin-etf-rug-pull/,"Most reports point to the potential approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange traded funds (ETF) filings in the US by January 2024. Given the current developments, the author of this article is also quite convinced that we may be heading there. But just to keep an open mind, is there are possibility for the US Securities and Exchange (SEC) to deny them? What could be the reason for this, and most importantly, how will it impact us? All signs lead to the likely mass approval of spot Bitcoin ETF requests around January 10, 2024. The SEC now appears to be fast-tracking everything as it just advised applicants to submit the final revisions of their filings on December 29. The regulator also recently provided instructions on how the institutions vying for spot Bitcoin ETFs on how they should proceed with their redemption models. Everyone seems to be complying with the advice of the agency despite a little reluctance on the parts of BlackRock and Grayscale. With the hard deadline and amendments coming straight from the horse’s mouth, it just does not make sense for the SEC to deny or further delay the proceedings. The present state of things, coupled with the much-awaited Bitcoin halving, is fueling the hype train. Lately, these have been instrumental in BTC breaking the $44K barrier for the first time in more than a year. As optimism runs high, it would be a punch in the gut to us who are betting on the crypto if things suddenly take a downturn. In November, prior to the major updates on the subject, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe warned that the SEC may reject the spot Bitcoin ETF filings. He said that the SEC’s decision may be grounded on the fact that exchanges and custody are not entirely separated. However, the US watchdog hadn’t raised such issues in its meetings with the applicants, so it might not be the case. Then again, there are experts like Nate Geraci who are keeping an eye over a potential swerve from the SEC. If the regulatory body denies the applications for some reason, it could be a catalyst for one of the “bigger rug pulls in crypto history.” He cleared out though that there’s a small window of probability for this ever happening. If spot bitcoin ETF not approved in January, might be one of bigger rug pulls in crypto history…Not my base case, but can’t entirely rule out given history here (which is why I said *close* to 100%).That said, sticking w/ my original pre-Grayscale court victory prediction. https://t.co/zhlLDgMlzw Some unpopular FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) is also being circulated as of late claiming that the SEC, in cahoots with financial powerhouses like BlackRock, may orchestrate a scheme to initially deny or continuously delay all spot Bitcoin ETFs due soon to tank BTC prices. This way, its favored institutions can further scoop more supply of the digital asset at lower prices before they blow off the roof again. It will be like the SEC shooting itself in the foot, but there’s some semblance of logic in this narrative if one considers that the verdict for BlackRock’s filing is not due until March 2024."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2023-12-25 16:00:00+00:00,How To Buy A Bitcoin Ordinal? – A Comprehensive Guide,https://blockzeit.com/buy-bitcoin-ordinal/,"You have probably heard of Bitcoin. But, have you heard of Ordinals? They are changing everything we know about NFTs. So, what are they? And why is everyone talking about them? In this article, we are going to break down what Ordinals are and introduce you to the latest innovations on the Bitcoin blockchain, and how you can get these inscriptions. Ordinals are a brand new way to look at the Bitcoin network that allows for all kinds of data like text audio, video, or jpegs of your favorite piece of art, to live on the blockchain. It sounds a lot like NFTs on other chains right? Ordinals totally change digital collectibles allowing information to be securely stored directly in Bitcoin blocks forever. When you purchase an NFT on another chain, all you are really getting is a link that points to a JPEG stored on someone else’s computer. The image can even be taken down or the domain of your NFT could get seized. Luckily, Bitcoin fixes all of that. Read: How Ordinals Project Will Benefit Bitcoin Created by former Bitcoin core contributor Casey Rodarmor in late January 2023, the Ordinals protocol is a convention for numbering and transferring individual Satoshi on the Bitcoin network effectively enabling Bitcoin native on-chain NFTs. Ordinals are just Satoshis — the smallest unit of Bitcoin. They are like Bitcoin serial numbers that let you track the history of the Bitcoin, see when it was mined, who owned it and how many times it has been transferred. Some Satoshis are even rarer than others based on when they are mined, who they are mined by, or the dates they were mined on. Inscriptions are a way of adding data to a Bitcoin the data can be anything from text, images, audio, or video. And once it is stored on the Bitcoin blockchain, they will always be there without any need of a third party. When you take a Satoshi and put your own data onto it. It is labeled with a unique inscription number — it is like a numerical label that shows you when you have added the information. So, if you added something a month ago, it would have a lower inscription number than if you added it today — lower numbers are usually considered more rare. An example would be the Inscription Number 0 by Casey Rodarmor. Read: Potentials Unlocked By Recursive Inscriptions In The Bitcoin Blockchain BRC-20 tokens are the hottest new things in the crypto right now, which have accounted for 41% of all Bitcoin transactions in May 2023. You heard that right, even tokens are now available on Bitcoin too. In March 2023, a developer that goes by the name of Domo (@domodata) started wondering if it would be possible to inscribe JSON formats to Satoshis to create a token standard for Bitcoin just like the ERC-20 for Ethereum. By attaching the JSON code to Satoshis, we can now define every characteristic of a BRC-20 token like minting and supply using codes. Just like any other tokens we are so familiar with, BRC-20 tokens can be minted and spent. Once deployed, any Bitcoin Ordinals wallet can connect to the network and mint the token. The first of such tokens was of course the thing that made all of these possible in the first place such as ORDI. Since its launch, ORDI became the largest BRC-20 token by market cap with over $1.17B. And of course in typical crypto fashion, other tokens that have gained broad visibility include tokens with names like MEME, PIZZA and PEPE. Read: BRC-20 Tokens Are Currently Blowing Up In China – Details Bitcoin was initially envisioned as a decentralized, peer to peer, electronic cash system. With BRC-20 tokens, more use cases are now unlocked.  Just like any other tokens, BRC-20 can be freely transferred between peers as digital cash and potentially used for payments on commercial platforms.  BRC-20 tokens also have the potential to kickstart a vibrant DeFi economy like what we have seen on Ethereum, including DEXs, lending platforms, structured products, yield farms, decentralized governance and more.  To take things one step further, BRC-20 tokens can also be tokenized to represent real world assets (RWAs), which can help increase the transparency and security of existing processes, and easily enable on-chain, fractional ownership which can lead to increased liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets like real estate. Thanks to Ordinals, miners are earning more now thanks to the increase in network activities, Bitcoin adoption is rising but the flipside of this also means more stress to the Bitcoin blockchain, resulting in higher gas fees. Xverse is a popular Bitcoin Web3 wallet at the time of this writing. Click “Download” and it will become an extension in your browser. You can also download it on your phone whether it is Android or iOS. After downloading, you are going to want to set it up. So, go to your extensions and click Xverse wallet, and hit “Create Wallet”. In here, you are going to want to back up your wallet. Click “Backup now”. And this is your seed phrase — the seed phrase is the most important thing as this is what gives you access to your wallet. Clicking “Show” will reveal your 12-word secret recovery phrase and you are going to want to make sure to write that in a super secure place. Do not store it on your computer or phone. After you have recorded your secret recovery phrase, you are going to have to create a password. Make sure it is super secure — use upper and lower cases, and then click “Continue”. Your wallet has been successfully created. In this wallet, you are going to have to make sure that you have Satoshis. In this aspect, it kind of reminds us of the way Ethereum needs gas fees.  To do that, You are going to have to go to a cryptocurrency exchange and buy Bitcoin. If you already have Bitcoin, then you just need to transfer it to your Xverse wallet. Now that you have your Ordinals wallet loaded with Bitcoin, you can start the process of choosing a marketplace and then finding an Ordinal that you want to buy. As for Ordinal marketplaces, there are a ton to choose from. So, for this tutorial, let’s go with Magic Eden. Head over to Magic Eden and connect your Xverse wallet to the DApp. Once you are connected, head over to Bitcoin Ordinals and choose a collection you want to buy. Similar to when you buy an NFT on Ethereum, you can purchase an existing NFT, one that’s already minted or in the case of Ordinals inscribed on the blockchain. With that said, some marketplaces work differently. I think as the market continues to progress, the marketplaces will all work more similarly to each other. However right now, there are different ways to buy or mint these Ordinals. Regardless of where you stand, you have to marvel at crypto’s continuous innovation. Is this just a fad that will pass soon? Or will Bitcoin DeFi and NFTs truly pose a challenge in Ethereum’s domain? But no matter what, always remember to DYOR and invest responsibly."
2023-12-25 10:00:00+00:00,Bigger Things Are Happening In Bitcoin Than ETF Approvals In The US,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-in-china-and-nigeria/,"There are two anticipated events currently building hype for Bitcoin (BTC). These are the anticipated mass approval of spot exchange traded funds (ETFs) based on the cryptocurrency and its coming halving. However, there are other bigger things outside of the US that could also pump it on a larger scale. Before anything else, let’s address the elephant in the room, and that’s the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently calling a meeting with all spot Bitcoin ETF applicants. The joint conference centers on adopting an In-Cash Redemption mechanism for their ETF models instead of the In-Kind Redemption system preferred by financial institutions. So far, most of them seemed to have already complied with the regulator’s previous recommendations to iron out the kinks in their requests. Only BlackRock and Grayscale are holding onto their original proposal by offering In-Kind as an alternative, arguing that it’s more efficient and attractive to investors than In-Cash. Furthermore, the SEC reportedly advised the financial institutions to finalize and submit their cash redemption model before the end of the year. All these point to the agency fast-tracking everything related to the ETF applications, which reinforces the narrative that it may be looking to lay down its decision soon. Experts predict the decision to be announced by January 10. There are also other things happening elsewhere that could potentially drive up Bitcoin adoption. China banned cryptocurrencies in 2021 due to their perceived risks to national security and social stability. It ordered a crackdown on transactions, exchanges, and mining involving crypto in the mainland. This consequently contributed to the long bear market in the past two years. The giant Asian nation’s decision was further backed by the collapse of Tether and FTX in 2022. Despite its strict enforcement, China has taken great strides in blockchain adoption and has displayed a softer stance on Hong Kong’s bid to become a global crypto hub. The country seems to be flipping its position on cryptocurrencies though based on the People’s Bank of China’s (PBoC) latest report. The document explained that cryptocurrencies have limited reach in traditional finance (TradFi) and that their market only accounts for 1% of the global arena. The same paper asked various governments to come up with the “same business, same risks, same supervision” approach in crypto regulation. Nigeria, another country resisting cryptos since 2021, also made a U-turn on its policies. Similarly, the Western African giant’s central bank is now recognizing that its previous stance on the matter is already getting outdated due to the growing demand and adoption of these digital assets. “However, current trends globally have shown that there is a need to regulate the activities of virtual assets service providers (VASPs) which include cryptocurrencies and crypto assets,” said the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on December 22. “Following this development, the Financial Action Task Force, FATF, in 2018 also updated its Recommendation 15 to require VASPs to be regulated to prevent misuse of virtual assets for ML/TF/PF.”"
2023-12-25 04:00:00+00:00,Are Bitcoin And Ethereum Heading For A Santa Claus Rally?,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-santa-claus-rally/,"It’s that time of the year again when everyone is in a festive mood. One of the anticipated events this week is the so-called “Santa Claus Rally.” So, will we see major gains in Bitcoin (BTC) and/or Ethereum (ETH) this season? Previously, we discussed what the Santa Claus Rally is all about. In a nutshell, it’s a phenomenon in stock investments happening within “the final five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the following year.” Since 1950 to 2023, the market has shown gains at an 80% probability. Now, there’s an ongoing narrative that cryptocurrencies may exhibit surges these holidays. With that, let’s take a look at the background and possibilities of a Christmas rally in Bitcoin and Ethereum on our way to 2024. Bitcoin does not appear to play ball during the Santa Claus Rally. Since cryptocurrencies trade 24/7 compared to stocks which are only limited by the operating schedules of the stock market, Techopedia compiled the performance of BTC starting from December 25th to January 2nd. Based on the illustration above, BTC only indicated significant gains on a scale of four out of ten or 40% of the time. The most increase it got during these periods was in the days leading to 2021 when it soared 35.9%. The worst was in the run to the following year when it shed 6.9% of its value. Using the same formula, the source examined how Ethereum moved throughout the event from its launch in the Christmas of 2015 to the New Year of 2023. From the looks of it, ETH has outclassed BTC in most instances. In an eight-year frame, the crypto pumped five times, translating to a 62.5% chance of benefitting from the Christmas rally. Even if we narrow Bitcoin’s stats from 2015 to the last occurrence, it’s still three out of eight times on the charts or a mere 37.5%. The best return for ETH during the rallies was 29.6% in 2017 while its worst was a dip of 5.4% in 2021. It should be noted, however, that Ethereum appeared to track the movements of Bitcoin from 2019 onwards. As displayed by the charts, Ethereum has better chances of outpacing Bitcoin during the Santa Claus Rally. But then again, if the two key narratives of BTC are placed in the equation being the anticipated mass approval of its spot exchange traded funds (ETFs) and halving all happening in the coming year, the premier crypto in terms of market cap could blow the roof. If not during the Xmas season, the massive gains of Bitcoin might happen on the way to January 10 when the US Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to give all the applications a go.

Analysts believe that the crypto market is going to surge in January after the approval happens, that is if it is going to happen. At this point, we are assured that the spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved by Jan 10th. Additionally, we have witnessed the SEC calling for a rare joint meeting with the ETF applicants in the U.S. to discuss the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. On YouTube, among well-known analysts, CryptoRUs predicted that the market expects a significant surge after ETF approval. He believes that, if the Bitcoin ETF is approved it will cause a large cash-inflow in the market. ETF approval in the U.S. will unleash investors and institutional investment into Bitcoin which will increase the price of Bitcoin and the crypto market at large.  “This is a done deal, Spot Bitcoin ETF is coming by Jan 10th,” he said assuring his viewers a 90% approval. #Bitcoin Will SKYROCKET After ETF Approval (It's Coming Very Soon) https://t.co/y9EXZDEMub Additionally, Hong Kong security and monetary regulations announced that they are set to review and accept ETF applicants. This comes after 5 years of the Security and Futures Commission (SFC) implementing professional investors only. This year alone, Hong Kong has changed its view towards cryptocurrencies. For instance, in April, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced it would permit virtual asset providers to operate in the city. Currently, it has allowed retail investors to engage in crypto ETFs under conditions.  Currently, the market is witnessing a bullish momentum, the crypto coins have been performing impressive in the past 50 days. Some of the top performing coins are Solana and Avalanche: The coins have witnessed a huge uptrend in the market since Jan 1st 2023. SOL for example has made an impressive growth of 732% being the second-best smart contract token after Ethereum. On the other hand, AVAX has also witnessed a 360% since Jan 1st 2023 and a 104% increase in the last 2 months. Currently, SOL is trading at $95, still below its all-time high of $259, while AVAX is trading at $45 below its all-time high of $144. Bitcoin on the other hand is showing some Bullish trend. Currently, the Bitcoin price has reached the $44,000 mark after the rare joint meeting between BlackRock, Nasdaq and the Security Exchange and Commission that was held yesterday. Analysts suggest that Bitcoin could reach the $50k mark as of Jan after the coin encountered resistance at the $43,300 and $43,500 mark, they believe that if the bullish momentum continues for a little while, the market will be closing at the $50,000 mark.  The ETF approval is really in the SEC’s hands, but the crypto community is positive that the SEC will take the right path to approval. ETF approval will ensure that U.S.-based retail investors have access to Bitcoin through spot Bitcoin ETFs. This will create a huge surge in the crypto market and also mark the acceptance of cryptocurrency in the financial industry. "
2023-12-24 07:00:00+00:00,"El Salvador Opens Doors, Grants Citizenship To Foreign Bitcoin Investors",https://blockzeit.com/el-salvador-citizenship-to-foreign-bitcoin-investors/,"In a latest development, El Salvador has passed a new law enabling foreign Bitcoin investors to obtain the country’s citizenship. The migration law, approved this Wednesday, will grant citizenship to foreigners who donate Bitcoin to the government’s social and economic development endeavors. El Salvador shocked the world in 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt cryptocurrency – Bitcoin specifically – as it’s legal tender back in September 2021. This bold move has since sparked a daredevil Bitcoin revolution that it’s continued to build on – and which other nations like the Central African Republic are gradually buying into. In January, the country passed a groundbreaking Digital Securities Law which established a “legal framework for all digital assets that are not Bitcoin. As well as those issued on Bitcoin.” Another reason for this law was to prepare the stage for issuing its volcano bonds and protect investors and customers from “bad actors” in the space. The Volcano Bond is the country’s geothermal energy project to harness volcanoes for mining Bitcoin and has been on the works since adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Meanwhile, the Volcano Bond has been legally approved and should be issued early next year, according to the country’s Bitcoin Office. “The Volcano Bond has just received regulatory approval from the Digital Assets Commission (CNAD). We anticipate the bond will be issued during the first quarter of 2024. This is just the beginning for new capital markets on #Bitcoin in El Salvador,” wrote the Bitcoin Office on X. Once issued, the Volcano Bond is expected to contribute considerably to the country’s Bitcoin economy and also influence greater investment. As for the new citizenship law, the intricacies of the dynamics are yet to be exposed. However, the law doesn’t yet hint at any minimum BTC donation requirement for foreigners looking to become citizens. According to the law, qualifying foreigners will be exempted from the country’s conventional 5-year residency requirement for people from non-Hispanophone countries. While the US crypto economy has been facing back and forths with the government elites and financial titans, El Salvador has been making giant strides to fully incorporate Bitcoin into its economy and achieve an actual nationwide acceptance. In the US, Senator Elizabeth Warren is waging a non-stop war against crypto – to impose limitations on its use and operation around the country. She’s garnered a group of 19 other senators who are motioning for a limitation in the modus operandi of crypto to mitigate  terrorism and other crimes. And so far, it seems US top players have only magnified all the minor loopholes in the crypto space. SEC Chief, Gary Gensler, has also sustained a reputation for having tussles with top exchanges and companies in the crypto economy. Yesterday, Gensler posted on X about non-compliance in the crypto space. “There is a lot of noncompliance in the crypto space. It undermines confidence when so many people have been hurt and all they can do is stand in line in the bankruptcy court. Further, this can make it hard for the good faith actors to compete,” wrote Gensler. Top crypto players reacted to the post decrying the SECs inability to create compliance guidelines for crypto companies like Coinbase for the past few years. An X user and top crypto influencer @ThinkingCrypto1, among others, replied to the Gensler’s tweet: “You are one to talk about noncompliance. You are a liar and have no allegiance to the law. You should be fired immediately,” said Gensler While all these controversies keep besetting the crypto space in the US, its South American counterpart is making applaudable advances with Bitcoin. El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, has also dropped his two cents about the political state of the US lately. “The United States has lost its ability to lecture any other country about “democracy,” said Bukele on X"

Moreover, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst commented on the news that they are concentrated on in-cash redemption since they are worried about money laundering. Earlier this week, BlackRock among the Spot Bitcoin ETFs applicants complied with the SEC rules and focused on filling the in-cash redemption. January 10th is the final day on which the SEC will determine the fate of Bitcoin ETF and how it will impact the crypto industry. Investors, the crypto community and the financial industry have confident that the SEC will approve the ETFs and make history in the crypto industry. The Bitcoin spot ETF approval is a big deal to the crypto industry, this will mark the adoption of digital currency in the United States and traditional institutions.

ETF will drive demand for Bitcoin by institutions which is set to create a huge cash inflow in the industry. Particularly, halving will ensure scarcity of Bitcoin, but, through ETF, individuals would access Bitcoin exposure at a lower cost thus impacting the market significantly. "
2023-12-22 08:31:40+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Tests $44K Again As SEC Meets With All ETF Applicants,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-tests-44k/,"Bitcoin price witnessed a price increase after crashing -10.21% last week. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $43,885.02 today, representing a 0.18% price increase in the last 24 hours and a 3.30% price increase in the past 7 days. Bitcoin is testing the $44,000 region again, but can it break above it? Let’s find out. Last week, Bitcoin’s journey toward $48,000 was disrupted by a sell-off that sent the asset’s price to the $40,000 region. However, the $40K region proved to be a strong support level. Bitcoin is still well above the 50 and 200-day moving averages and investors still remain bullish about the asset. The $44k – $45K region has become a strong resistance area and bulls can only hope to break through it. Additionally, the SEC had been ordered by the court to take a fresh look at Spot Bitcoin ETF and it looks like the regulatory agency heeded the order. Bitcoin chart spots a potential double top pattern on the daily timeframe, putting a concern in the hearts of investors and traders alike. The pattern is completed in the fashion of a double top, Bitcoin is looking to drop to $40,000 and if $40k does not hold, the asset may sink further to the $38,000 region. However, if $40,000 holds, BTC would have officially entered a consolidation phase in which whales accumulate between $40,000 and $44,000 before the next push upwards. Alternatively, the potential double top may not form and Bitcoin may end up rising higher and breaking above the $44,000 barrier – This is the most ideal scenario given the general trend of BTC is upwards. 6️⃣ The ETF spot applicants make a small amount of changes to their spot ETF listing after the meetings.7️⃣ Multiple BTC spot ETF commercials by the applicants have surfaced online this week.8️⃣ The SEC has held a meeting with ALL BTC spot ETF applicants today. Meanwhile, the SEC held a rare meeting with all the spot Bitcoin ETF applicants recently. From posts made by the attendees, the focus of the meeting was on ensuring “cash creates” and requesting the removal of in-kind redemptions from filings. Removing “in-kind redemptions”, means that investors cannot exchange their ETF shares for a basket of the underlying assets that the ETF holds (in this case Bitcoin). They would be forced to receive cash instead. These regulations are aimed at maintaining the supremacy of cash (USD) over Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

2023-12-22 06:00:00+00:00,How Much Is BlackRock Investing In Bitcoin Mining,https://blockzeit.com/how-much-is-blackrock-investing-in-bitcoin-mining/,"BlackRock, Inc. is now the world’s largest asset manager with $9.425 trillion assets under management (AUM). On the other hand, Bitcoin (BTC) remains the biggest cryptocurrency out there with a market cap of $851 billion at prevailing rates. With these, it comes as no surprise that everyone got so worked up when the two powerhouses in their respective industries intersected via a spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF). BlackRock is still awaiting approval for its spot Bitcoin ETF filed under the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Given the recent developments, industry watchers are confident that the regulator may drop the gavel favorably by next month. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink was once a major critic of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. He once called BTC “an index of money laundering.” In a plot twist though, his company made news mid-2023 when its spot Bitcoin ETF filing was made public. The event was one of the primary catalysts for the ongoing Bitcoin bull run. The public generally saw this as a recognition of the digital asset’s legitimacy and future potential. However, some in the crypto community immediately frowned upon the idea that a company once discrediting Bitcoin is now riding on its coattails. Others raised also alarm over the company’s move for power consolidation in both the traditional financial (TradFi) and digital institutions. Moreover, there are fears that the entry of BlackRock and buddies at Wall Street could deconstruct BTC’s decentralized ethos. It appears BlackRock is not merely contented on disrupting the market with its spot Bitcoin ETF. The asset manager has been strategically placing its bets on Bitcoin miners, too. BlackRock’s foray into Bitcoin mining came under the spotlight in August when people dug in deeper to find out its other moves toward the digital asset. From there, it was discovered that the financial giant had major stakes in four out of five of the world’s largest Bitcoin miners. However, the trail does not end there. Recently, it was revealed that BlackRock continues to be highly involved in the Bitcoin mining industry as it just adjusted its positions on its stakes. BlackRock’s portfolio adjustments improved its control of Marathon Digital at 11,206,584 shares valued at $98.7 million. It also brought its Riot Platforms ownership to 5.65% at 11,215,047 shares priced at $109.68 million. In light of these events, the firm sold its 11,042 Bit Digital shares at $8.59 million. This earned the company 4,81% from the investment. Meanwhile, BlackRock maintains a 1.07% stake in Cipher Mining, a 3.68% ownership in TeraWulf, a 0.37% control in Stronghold Digital, a 0.31% share in Greenidge Generation Holdings, and a 5.38% stake in Cleanspark."
2023-12-22 04:00:00+00:00,More Spot Bitcoin ETF Ads Rolled Out,https://blockzeit.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-ads/,"Hashdex just launched its spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange traded fund (ETF) advertisement. Meanwhile, Bitwise doubled down on its previous commercial by releasing another version of it. Optimism for the coming approval of spot Bitcoin ETF applications in the US is heating up as Hashdex just joined the fray with its advert. This follows the promo of Bitwise, which shows strong confidence on their part that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will favor their filings. Hashdex’s 20-second ad features a mining truck in the desert with the prompts: It ends with the logo of Hashdex and a call to action to visit Hashdex-etfs.com. JUST IN: Hashdex releases new Spot #Bitcoin ETF commercial.  pic.twitter.com/HOocAic7Am So, following the breadcrumbs to learn more reveals that the Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF (referred to as the “Fund”) is sponsored by Teucrium Trading, LLC. Teucrium was established in 2010 focusing on providing investments in alternative markets through ETF instruments. Hashdex reminds us that the Fund only provides price exposure to Bitcoin via futures contracts and it does not invest in the cryptocurrency directly. In other words, it only allows investors to earn through correctly tracking Bitcoin price movements. The second spot Bitcoin ETF commercial of Bitwise has the same format, featuring Jonathan Goldsmith, a.k.a. “Most Interesting Man in the World” again. However, the monologue is changed to “Thought you would like to know… Satoshi sends his regards.” After that, Goldsmith says, “Look for Bitwise, my friends.” The last frame also contains a fine print warning investors of the risks of investing in crypto assets to comply with regulatory standards. JUST IN: Bitwise releases second Spot #Bitcoin ETF commercial. pic.twitter.com/jeUjqQfY8x The developments in the spot Bitcoin ETF niche were enough to build hype for BTC, which pumped up above the $44,000 line on Thursday. As of this writing at 7:00 PM UTC on December 21, Bitcoin stepped back by 1.59% to $43,500 from its daily high. Trading volume has also gone down by 8.41% as only $24.184 billion worth of BTC moved in crypto exchanges. Zooming out on the weekly and monthly charts indicates gains of 1.5% and 18%, respectively, for the digital asset. The current prices are still 36% behind Bitcoin’s all-time high of $68,789 on November 10, 2021. However, the crypto community is positive that BTC may be able to break the barrier by next year as the spot Bitcoin ETFs are finally given a green light by the SEC, and the halving drives more demand for the finite cryptocurrency."
2023-12-21 10:35:56+00:00,"Bitcoin Bounces Back Above $43,000",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-bounces-back-above-43000/,"Bitcoin has again rebounded above the $43k resistance. On the 19th of December, analysts noted that Bitcoin recorded $43,189. After Blackrock Bitcoin spot ETF filling, Bitcoin retained close to $40k support.  Bitcoin recorded a strong bullish momentum after the SEC announced that the United States would be the first to acquire BTC spot ETF (Exchange-Traded Funds). As of the time of writing, Bitcoin recorded a $43,577 high. Although Bitcoin started the week with uncertainties, the Bulls decided otherwise on 18th Dec after the market closed with an increase of 5% above the day’s low.  Info: Read more here about this weeks Bitcoin Price Analysis. Bitcoin price was staggering to climb above $43,000 resistance on 18th December. Although the price reached that high, it also witnessed a slithering downside till the 19th when things went sideways. On the 20th, Bitcoin broke the resistance, and BTC managed to escalate its price to above $43,500. Analysts suggest that if the price could surpass the $43,500 resistance could trigger the price to $48,000 and surpass above $50,000 by Jan.  In the recent days, Bitcoin has shown some strength which is significant to the market. Bitcoin has so far surpassed some key resistance levels while aiming to record highs that it has not touched since 2022. This has attracted investors and market specialists to conclude that Bitcoin might surpass its all-time high. Reports show that the likelihood of the SEC approving Bitcoin spot is 99.99% in January 2024, although there is no definition time at which the SEC will approve Bitcoin spot ETF, asset managers like BlackRock are certain to expect a favorable decision by the 10th of Jan. Micro-Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor during an interview with Bloomberg Crypto, said that Bitcoin will witness a bull run adding that approval of spot Bitcoin ETF will increase the demand for Bitcoin in 2024. Bitcoin halving is going to happen in April 2024 and scarcity of Bitcoin will be witnessed. Bitcoin halving will reduce the number of Bitcoin mined from 900 to 450. With Bitcoin spot ETF approval, BTC demand will be high and this will facilitate Bitcoin’s price to escalate.  The ETF approval is a hot topic in the crypto industry. It will act as a bridge between traditional investors and the crypto industry. It will enable Bitcoin to expand its territory and impact the financial sector. Moreover, if the approval of Bitcoin spot ETF is approved a cash flow of $100 billion will be expected into the crypto market. This will potentially increase Bitcoin’s value in the market and propel the industry. ETF approval matters to the crypto industry, it marks the acceptance and evolution of the crypto industry. Potential approval in Jan will ensure institution investors are drawn near to crypto which will ensure there is a crypto surge in the market. "
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."

We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."

A $178.6 million acquisition sets in motion the expansion of its Bitcoin mining operations in Texas and Nebraska. Florida-based Marathon Digital just used its $178.6 million stash to take more slice of the Bitcoin mining sector. The firm said it purchased Generate Capital’s plants in Granbury, Texas, and Kearney, Nebraska, to boost its mining capacity by 390 megawatts. Crunching the numbers, it just paid $485,000 per MW increase. The addition of the facilities is expected to intensify Marathon Digital’s total Bitcoin mining capacity to 910 MW while speeding up its hashrate to around 50 EH/s within the next 18 to 24 months. The resulting exahashes performed per second are roughly double their current capabilities. Marathon Digital presently owns 3% of its 584 MW facilities. The start of operations of its new fully-owned plants will increase its stake by 45%. Furthermore, the acquisitions will help the Bitcoin miner cut down its coin generation expenses by 30%. “For the past year, Marathon has been vertically integrating as we transition into a more sophisticated and mature organization with a diversified portfolio of Bitcoin mining technologies and assets, and the acquisition of these sites is the next step in that evolution,” said Marathon Digital Chair and CEO Fred Thiel in a press release. “We have spent the past year strengthening our balance sheet by increasing our cash position, adding to our bitcoin holdings, and reducing our debt to prepare for the halving and to ensure we can capitalize on accretive opportunities as they present themselves,” added Marathon CFO Salman Khan. Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (MARA) shares pumped by 11% as soon as the buyouts were made public on Tuesday. This also caused a chain reaction in other Bitcoin mining stocks like Cipher, Terrawulf, and SOS Limited, which grew between 9% to 14%. On a broader scope, the movement of these investments nudged the S&P 500 up by 0.6%. The momentum of Marathon Digital continued to build up to $23.95 at 2:00 PM EST on Wednesday until eventually retracing to $22.10 at market close, which is still 0.59% over the previous day’s close. Meanwhile, MARA has shown a tremendous 32.26% rise in the past five days, 11.79% spike in the past month, and 550% surge on a year-to-date (YTD) basis."
2023-12-21 04:00:00+00:00,We’re Going To Get The Spot ETF Approval Before January 10th says Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz,https://blockzeit.com/were-going-to-get-the-spot-etf-approval-before-january-10th-says-galaxy-digital-ceo-michael-novogratz/,"Galaxy Digital founder and CEO has said we should expect the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals before January 10th. He stated this in a CNBC “Squawk Box” yesterday discussing the current state of cryptocurrency, the latest with the Bitcoin ETFs, 2024 prospects, and other pressing matters. “We are going to get this ETF before January 10th. That is kind of a drop dead date against Gensler before he gets in trouble with Grayscale and the lawsuit. And so, I think you’re going to see this (you know) announced…it wouldn’t start trading then. That will probably take six to eight weeks after that, but it’s just more fuel for a fire…” said Novogratz. Grayscale had sued the SEC back in June of last year over the resection of its application to convert its GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) into a Spot Bitcoin ETF. The SEC rejected its ETF application because the regulator believed such a product was highly susceptible to market manipulation. Fast forward to August this year the tables turned against the SEC. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Grayscale, stating that the company’s intended ETF is very similar to already approved Bitcoin Futures ETFs. In addition, the court dismissed the SEC’s argument that Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) price and market surveillance would suffice in detecting malicious and manipulating market activities. After the ruling, the SEC had 45 days to appeal the ruling, which it didn’t do, this putting Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF application in the works for approval together with other a dozen other applications.  Although Grayscale’s court victory over the SEC has no direct bearing on whether or not the SEC will approve the Bitcoin ETF applications, Galaxy Digital’s Novogratz and others believe the court win could influence the regulator to approve the applications, seeing that their eventual operation won’t be inimical to investors. BlackRock has held many meetings with the SEC over the prospects of its Spot Bitcoin ETF approval. The last meeting was held yesterday, making it three meetings in just seven business days and giving a greenlight to a potential SEC approval come January. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck is also confident that the SEC will do a mass approval of the Bitcoin ETFs and that the “SEC approval of a spot bitcoin ETF is in itself bullish.” “I very much expect it will be all one day beacuse that’s what happened with the Etherum Futures…,” said van Eck in a recent CNBC interview."
2023-12-20 10:00:00+00:00,BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF Filing Amended To Accommodate The SEC’s Wishes,https://blockzeit.com/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing-amended-to-accommodate-the-secs-wishes/,"BlackRock recently met with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and amended its S-1 filing for its spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange traded funds (ETF). The revised document reveals the IBIT ticker for the financial instrument. Most importantly, the updated application contained a new provision for the creation and redemption model of the iShares Bitcoin Trust. The amendment follows the SEC’s recommendation to include cash redemptions. However, the asset manager firm still pushes for its original in-kind system in addition to the regulator’s preference. There are also reports that both BlackRock and Nasdaq had a meeting with the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets. “The discussion concerned The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC’s proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust under NASDAQ Rule 5711(d),” said SEC’s memo. “Blackrock also provided the attached presentation.” The flowcharts shown below provide a comparison between the in-cash redemption model favored by SEC and the original in-kind redemption model submitted by BlackRock: As shown in the proposed mechanisms, the in-kind version is more simplified and it allows greater flexibility for the issuer. It is basically similar to the stock-based ETF wherein the retail investors could redeem their shares via Bitcoin from BlackRock, which could then be converted into cash through a broker-dealer. On the other hand, the in-cash variant adds more safeguards to consumers to quell the concerns of the regulatory body of possible avenues for market manipulation. The chart above details a process where BlackRock takes the Bitcoin out of its wallet to be able to sell it on the market and the cash is handed to the investor. The difference of the schemes all boils down to who will take the conversion risk between the ETF issuer and the retail investor. This is seen as a positive development and a win-win situation for BlackRock and SEC. With Blackrock adjusting to accommodate the SEC’s wishes, the regulator will no longer have a reason to deny the application because the company simply followed what it dictated. The news further fuels speculations that the SEC may be looking to finalize its decisions regarding all pending spot Bitcoin ETF filings come January 5, 2024. According to industry watchers and analysts, this will eventually lead to major announcements by January 10, which could finally pump Bitcoin into new highs. BTC hadn’t moved much as of this writing at 11:30 AM UTC. The most dominant cryptocurrency by market cap is still trading at 42,800, dipping only by 0.55% on the 24-hour chart. Trading volume also fell by 13.36% as only $20.734 billion worth of Bitcoin moved in the market during the timeframe. Could this be a sign that most Bitcoiners are on a HODL right now? In the same bracket, prices of the digital asset moved between $41,800 and $43,000."
2023-12-19 16:00:00+00:00,Bitwise Fires The First Shot In The Bitcoin ETF War,https://blockzeit.com/bitwise-fires-the-first-shot-in-the-bitcoin-etf-war/,"Confident with the approval of its spot Bitcoin ETF application, Bitwise has already fired the first shot in the ad war for these new financial instruments. Bitwise Asset Management, Inc. just launched a short advertisement that sure had the crypto community all pumped up. It’s a pretty straightforward one featuring Jonathan Goldsmith, also known as the “Most Interesting Man in the World” in TV commercials, in a two-liner promo saying, “You know what’s interesting these days? Bitcoin.” The ad ends with “Bitwise: ETFs backed by crypto specialists” along with a lengthy small print detailing the risks of investing in cryptocurrency assets and tokens. So far, the original version of the advert already racked up 1.9 million views on the X platform. A word to the wise, from a man of few words. #bitcoinisinteresting https://t.co/wantGiAIqJ pic.twitter.com/x5MPbElEev Of course, many people see this as a sign of confidence in the approval of Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin ETF filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). For speculators, it could also mean the company may have caught wind of something related to its ETF application that the public does not know yet. Regardless, it’s either great news waiting for us all or Bitwise is just counting its chickens before they hatch. Bitcoin nudges up by 2% to $42,632 on the 24-hour chart as of 2:30 PM UTC on Tuesday just hours following the release of the Bitwise ad. Trading volume also increased at the same rate as $23.55 billion worth of BTC was traded in crypto exchanges while prices swung between a low of $41,152 and a high of $43,354 in the same frame. Zooming out the charts reveals that Bitcoin gained 2% on the weekly, 17% on the monthly, and 155% on the annual timeframes. The massive recovery of Bitcoin allowed it to gradually narrow the gap from its current price to its all-time high of $68,789 on November 10, 2021, by around 38%. That’s still a long way to go, but if the super bullish predictions of prominent analysts are to be considered, it may eventually surpass those numbers sometime in 2024. Estimates range from Bitwise Senior Analyst Ryan Rasmussen’s conservative $80K forecast to the bold $1 million projection of ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood on the way to 2030. Bitcoin is uniquely positioned for a major push due to two key events happening in its ecosystem by next year. The first is the anticipated mass approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF filings pending SEC scrutiny from January 5 to 10. Actually, the SEC is only scheduled to give its final decision for 21Shares & ARK Bitcoin ETF of ARK Invest by the tenth, but industry experts are optimistic that it will be a sweeping endorsement of other filings to level the playing field. Meanwhile, the halving is expected on April 19, 2024, which will increase the mining difficulty and decrease the rewards in the Bitcoin ecosystem. This will further drive the scarcity of the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, resulting in spiking prices."
2023-12-18 08:00:00+00:00,VanEck Makes New Bold Predictions On Bitcoin For 2024,https://blockzeit.com/vaneck-bitcoin-prediction-2024/,"The CEO of VanEck recently sat down on CNBC’s The Exchange to share his thoughts on the direction Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies are heading in 2024. What he said was nothing short of great news for the crypto community. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck reaffirmed his company’s bullish stance on Bitcoin on Friday during an interview with CNBC’s Kelly Evans. He started things off by explaining how the digital asset would react to the fall in interest rates and how it’s behaving similar to gold. “It’s the macro. Stores of value that don’t generate interest, which is why investors like Warren Buffet don’t like them at all, but they behave really in relation to interest rates,” van Eck said. “That’s the big cycle, and interest rates are headed down, directionally speaking.” “So the macro behind Bitcoin and gold are very strong. By the way, they kind of do perform similarly,” he went on. “They both peaked in 2021, they’ve both been rallying this year, obviously, Bitcoin way more than gold for different reasons.” When asked whether or not Bitcoin is in a bubble, the head of VanEck explained that there’s more growth to it than what many perceive. “You can argue about it being in a bubble, but it bubbled in 2017 but then it hit all-time highs in 2021,” the VanEck chief responded. “So, nothing has ever been a bubble that then has outperformed itself.” Van Eck didn’t provide any numbers or deadlines but is positive that the coming wave of spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) approvals in the US could spur all-time highs in BTC and other cryptocurrency prices in the next 12 months. He also expressed his strong belief that the US Securities and Exchange Commission may be aiming to act on the filings all at once to keep the playing field level for everyone. By the way, it’s worth mentioning that VanEck’s ticker for its refiled Bitcoin ETF is “HODL.” Supplementing the bullish outlook of its CEO is a series of tweets enumerating the global investment manager’s early December market predictions. The main forecast revolves around how the US recession and the expected approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs could serve as a perfect recipe to bring over $2.4 billion in inflows into Bitcoin ETFs by the first quarter of 2024. VanEck does not see major price movements in the digital asset during the halving. Instead, the big gains are anticipated during the post-halving period. Further propelling its values will be the US presidential elections, which would dictate positive narratives in terms of crypto regulations. Lastly, the analysts of the firm projected a boost in the utility of Bitcoin in remittances and how Bitcoin Staking on Lightning Network could open up new yield avenues in its ecosystem. As of this writing at 3:30 AM UTC on Monday, Bitcoin is trading at $41,027, showing a 2% drop 24 hours prior. Despite that, trading is 32.28% as $18.558 billion BTC moved between wallets within the period. Prices moved between $40,798 to $42,359 throughout the same daily chart."
2023-12-18 04:00:00+00:00,Cathie Wood Doubles Down On Super Bullish $1M Bitcoin Forecast,https://blockzeit.com/cathie-wood-bitcoin-forecast/,"ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood just reaffirmed her prediction that Bitcoin (BTC) has the tendency to reach a million. This time her numbers were pegged at $1.48 million per BTC by 2030. Cathie Wood, the founder, CEO, and CIO of ARK since 2014, strongly believes in the capabilities of Bitcoin. Her over-the-million forecast for the digital asset is grounded on several factors. First, the ARK boss sees the institutional adoption of the coin as the primary launching pad for its climb to unprecedented levels. She likens the digital asset matching other investments like emerging markets and real estate in terms of potential. Wood’s next reasoning is anchored on the narrative that Bitcoin is an “obvious hedge against inflation.” She believes it’s more practical for companies to hold their balance in BTC rather than cash, which diminishes its purchasing power over time. Lastly, the head of ARK foresees Bitcoin’s utility when it comes to remittances. She pointed out that using the cryptocurrency for overseas transactions would protect users from fiat’s volatility and hyperinflation. Besides her $6 billion company’s reputation on the line, Wood has successfully wagered on emerging technologies over the years. The ARK exec is best known for her accurate projection that Tesla would soar to a pre-split price of $4,000 back in 2018, which represented a 1,000% gain for its stock at that time. However, dissecting her latest theory would reveal some discrepancies in the current state of Bitcoin according to Motley Fool’s Jeremy Bowman. The analyst primarily cited the crypto’s slow adoption even in El Salvador, which fully embraced it as a legal tender and reserve asset. Additionally, BTC has been constantly bashed by seasoned investors like Warren Buffet who referred to it as “rat poison squared” and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon who said would “close it down” if he were the government. Bowman also argued about BTC’s tendency to seesaw in prices, hence, obliterating its inflation hedge narrative and getting it marked by financial experts as a high-beta risk asset. Aside from its fluctuations as of late, a recent example is in 2022 when the digital money crashed together with the stock market. Let’s add to that Coin Bureau’s claim that 40% of its valuation is influenced by hype. Finally, the Motley Fool analyst cleared out that volatility as well as lack of trust and security have hindered Bitcoin as a medium for remittances. As of this writing at 12:00 AM UTC on Monday, Bitcoin’s price dropped by 2% to $41,329.38 on the 24-hour chart. The trading volume of the most dominant cryptocurrency in the market, however, is up by 11.16% as it moved around $16 million between wallets during the period. Meanwhile, the same timeframe saw BTC tread between a low of $41,572 and a high of $42,359. So far, its price is significantly down by nearly $3,000 after tapping the $44,000 mark two weeks ago."
2023-12-15 11:56:49+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Bounces Off $41,000 As The SEC Takes A New Look At Spot Bitcoin ETFs",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-bounces-off-41000/,"Bitcoin price went down -8.62% on Monday, December 11, 2023, driving fear into the market that Bitcoin could fall back to lower $30,000’s. The price of Bitcoin is $42,903, which represents a 0.27% price increase in the last 24 hours and a -0.80% price decline in the past 7 days. Last week’s analysis presented two possibilities for a retracement of the Bitcoin price. On Friday, BTC formed a double-top high at $44,729. The price was to fall back into the supply zone and retest two possible price points – $41,014 and $37,521. The BTC price on Monday experienced a crash of more than 8% causing it to fall below $41,014. The fall however did reach the lower price target of $37,521, invalidating the second possibility (2). Bitcoin price bounced off the $41k support and rose 6.99%.  The double top formed at the $44,7k region forms a new local resistance that BTC needs to beat if it is going to reach the $50,000 target. After successfully bouncing off the $41k region, BTC is now headed toward the $48k target. If Bitcoin manages to clear the $44.7k local top, it will quickly hit $48,000. Afterward, $52k will not be far behind. In the backdrop of this Bitcoin price volatility, Gary Gensler, Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) appeared on CNBC on Thursday and talked about Bitcoin ETFs. On the order of the court, the SEC is required to take a new look at Spot Bitcoin ETFs. This news sends hope into the hearts of Bitcoin cna crypto investors as they feel approval may just be around the corner.  VanEck and Grayscale have submitted further amendments to their ETF applications, which is an indicator that the SEC may be guiding them on how to adhere to their rules, before finally approving their application.

2023-12-14 08:00:00+00:00,Bitcoin Heading To $80K In 2024 Says Bitwise Analyst,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-heading-to-80k-in-2024-says-bitwise-analyst/,"Bitwise analyst Ryan Rasmussen gave his bullish prediction on Bitcoin (BTC) saying that it might be heading to $80K by 2024. The forecast is anchored on the growing preference for stablecoins in the payments sector and other factors. In 2024… Bitcoin will set a new all-time high, the spot bitcoin ETF will be the most successful ETF launch of all time, Coinbase’s revenue will double, and more…Here are 10 Crypto Predictions for 2024 by the team at @BitwiseInvest🧵👇 Ryan Rasmussen, a senior crypto research analyst at Bitwise, recently outlined his take on Bitcoin. He started with the consensus’ bullish narrative grounded on the anticipated launch of spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the US and the halving — all happening in the first four months of 2024. Then, he went on to discuss how the new financial instruments could capture 1% or $72 billion assets under management (AUM) of the $7.2 trillion ETF market. Rasmussen pointed out that the rising adoption of stablecoins in payments could drive the bullish narrative of Bitcoin. He recounted how these crypto “killer apps” have gone from zero to a $137 billion market in the past four years. In the past quarter, the trading volume of stablecoins peaked at $5 trillion compared to Visa’s $9 trillion processed transactions. The analyst sees a further tip in the scale in favor of stablecoins in the following years. Prediction #4: More money will settle using stablecoins than using Visa.Stablecoins are one of crypto’s “killer apps,” growing from effectively zero to a $137 billion market in the past four years, and we think 2024 will be another major year of growth. pic.twitter.com/uGjRxZjsyt Interestingly, the expert believes artificial intelligence (AI) assistants will emerge as new players in the industry, which will likely utilize digitally native money like Bitcoin or stablecoins for payment settlement. This will reinforce the idea of crypto as “the native currency of the Internet.” Rasmussen also projected that more than $100 million will be staked in decentralized prediction markets for event-based and conventional sports-related betting. Again, Bitcoin and stablecoins will likely be tied in this trend. Lastly, the ease of access to Bitcoin will result in more financial advisors allocating to crypto in clients’ accounts. Besides Bitcoin, Rasmussen tackled how Ethereum (ETH) will benefit from the 2024 crypto bull market. He noted that a major upgrade to Ether next year will pull down its transaction costs by over 90% to $0.01, which is certain to entice more users into its ecosystem. It could consequently bring in more revenue for the crypto, estimated to be two times from today’s $2.3 billion to $5 billion. And when it comes to crypto exchanges, Coinbase will benefit the most in the US market rush and Bitwise estimates the company will surpass Wall Street expectations by over ten times. The former’s 2024 analytics data estimates a $5.69 billion revenue for the exchange compared to the latter’s $3.1 billion outlook. That’s over 100% more than the assessed earnings of Coinbase this year at $2.845 billion."
2023-12-13 10:00:00+00:00,Bitcoin Could Boom In 2024 As US Dollar Woes Loom,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-could-boom-in-2024-against-the-us-dollar/,"We are yet to cap off 2023 but there are warnings that the coming year does not bode well for the US dollar. That depends on which side you’re on when the countdown is over though, because 2024 could be a profitable opportunity for Bitcoin (BTC) holders and the overall cryptocurrency community. More financial analysts are now voicing their concerns over the stability of the US dollar primarily due to the USA’s looming recession, political uncertainty, and ballooning debt. These are aggravated by the growing threat of the Digital Yuan and Digital Euro in the USD’s global dominance. US inflation has been at its highest for over four decades. If there’s any consolation, however, the government’s money printers are showing signs of cooling down as evidenced by the 3.7% to 3.2% inflation decline from September to October data. It is estimated to be further tempered in the November data to be released on Tuesday. But then again, JPMorgan is convinced that the recession was only “delayed rather than diminished.” The nation is also showing a lot of division with the different political views at play as the US Presidential Election is scheduled on November 5, 2024. Former President Donald Trump is staging a comeback to challenge President Joe Biden. However, with the former’s ongoing cases, crypto supporter Vivek Ramaswamy and CBDC critic Ron DeSantis are hoping to capitalize on the outcome. In the middle is Bitcoin advocate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. who’s looking to provide an alternative for those already fed up with the past two administrations. We are still 11 months away, but the staging ground is about to get bloodier than it already is as the election nears its climax. After that, the country would then have to brace itself for a new economic landscape if Biden is kicked out of the White House. US debt exceeded $33 trillion for the first time in history because of the increase in government spending. Among the factors blamed for the increase are the country’s continuing post-pandemic relief programs, foreign funding efforts, and political opposition to some of the administration’s proposed tax policies. Both the European Union and China are doubling down on their central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), as shown by the development of their pilot operations. Despite this, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes the two financial instruments are far from ready to be a viable alternative to the US dollar. Thus, the crypto exchange honcho stated that Bitcoin holds the key to “extending Western civilization.” The mentioned scenarios, which could affect the US dollar, will likely reinforce the concept of Bitcoin as a hedge against financial and geopolitical uncertainties going into 2024. Since its advent, the most dominant crypto in the market has been driven by narratives likening it to gold, hence, its moniker “Digital Gold” in its early days. Meanwhile, CoinShares Research Associate Luke Nolan said Bitcoin could skyrocket to $70,000 by the end of 2024 in an email to Forbes. The expert’s conservative estimate is anchored on the hope that the easing of financial conditions turns out as expected and rate cuts are implemented mid-next year combined with an increase in global liquidity. On the other hand, the rumor mill has it that the US government may be cooking a Sovereign Wealth Fund BTC Investment. Crypto personality Luke Broyles claimed its position could dwarf MicroStrategy Chief Michael Saylor’s holdings by 671 times. Furthermore, Jefferies’ analysts posit that the Federal Reserve may debase the US dollar in 2024. This could boost Bitcoin prices by an extra mile. Lastly, let’s not forget the two Bitcoin milestones coming up. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to decide on the fate of Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) by January and Bitcoin halving is occurring in April."
2023-12-12 08:00:00+00:00,"Grayscale CEO On Spot Bitcoin ETF: “It Remains A Matter Of When, Not A Matter Of If.”",https://blockzeit.com/grayscale-ceo-on-spot-bitcoin-etf/,"Grayscale CEO, Michael Sonnenshein said he is optimistic that a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved in early 2024. Speaking on CNBC, he said that the approval of such an ETF remains a matter of when not if.  JUST IN: Grayscale CEO tells CNBC he is optimistic that a spot #Bitcoin ETF will be approved in early 2024 Bitcoin ETF applications have remained the talk of the crypto space for half a year now, with speculations accumulating by the day. The bitcoin price rose over 12% to meet these speculations, while the SEC remained silent about the matter. Deadlines for submission of final amended applications have been set for all firms that have applied for the ETF. A summary of the companies that have applied for #Bitcoin (BTC) Spot #ETF so far and the deadlines to follow: The rise of Bitcoin to $44,000 coincided with Gold price hitting record highs. This led to market analyzers to conclude that global chaos could be fueling Bitcoin and Gold rise as they are safe havens. December 11, 2023, 00:00 – Bitcoin price nuked -7.12% in less than one hour, liquidating over $330 million in long positions. Bitcoin crashed to a low of $40,670, but the price retraced quickly back to the $42k region. #Bitcoin Crash at $40000 pic.twitter.com/8PHFDZwnXN Traders and investors on crypto Twitter are calling it a liquidity hunt since there was no reason for the crash to happen.  Moving on, investors expect Bitcoin to pull back to the low to mid 30Ks in January before the real bull run begins.  Blackrock is the largest asset fund manager in the world, boasting 575/576 ETF applications approved by the SEC. The 576th application is for Bitcoin and there are slim chances that they will lose this one. Bitcoin ETFs introduce crypto and bitcoin to the masses, making it easier for them to speculate on this asset.  However, perhaps the most important factor is that firms applying for Bitcoin Spot ETFs have to have actual Bitcoin in their reserved backing up the ETFs. The billion-dollar and trillion-dollar asset fund managing firms have to ensure they get Bitcoin at a cheaper price before the ETF’s approval. The fact that Grayscale’s CEO is optimistic about a spot bitcoin ETF approval speaks volumes about the state of the ETFs in the coming month. The majority of deadlines for final submissions lie between January and March 2024."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2023-12-12 06:00:00+00:00,$330M Crypto Longs Burned As Bitcoin Red Candles Were Lit On Monday,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-crypto-longs/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been on a bull rush until it hit a wall on Monday. The sudden shift in momentum resulted in the liquidation of long positions in cryptocurrency. The decline of Bitcoin price on Monday also dragged other cryptocurrencies in its wake. The failure of the most dominant digital currency to maintain the $43K range wiped out a total of $332.8 million long positions in crypto within the day based on data obtained by Decrypt from Coinglass. On the other hand, $57.02 million short positions were burned during that period. In summation, these represented losses for 109,025 traders. Fast-forward today, the market appeared to have tamed a bit. Onchain data reflects $161.47 million longs and $59.87 shorts taken out in the past 24 hours from 62,815 traders. As of this writing at 5:00 AM Tuesday, BTC is still struggling between the $40K and $42K lines with current price at $41,500 and dropping by 1.61% in the 24-hour chart. The decline drags the value of its 19.57 million circulating supply to $812.08 billion. Meanwhile, the token saw a trading volume of $33.85 billion, which represents an increase of 53% within that timeframe. Bitcoin remains over 39% down from its all-time high recorded on November 10, 2021, at $68,789. However, overall optimism remains in the crypto community that it will eventually cross that threshold upon the realization of two major milestones happening in the first two quarters of 2024 — the approval of Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETF) in the US and the Bitcoin halving. The hype surrounding the Bitcoin ETF filings in the US has cooled down lately due to lack of updates from official and insider sources. This is currently seen by the majority as a contributing factor in the failure of BTC to pump further. The ongoing consensus though, is that all Bitcoin ETF applications will likely be approved between January 5 to 10 next year. This coincides with the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) ultimatum to act with finality on the request of ARK Invest, but industry watchers and even the company’s CEO, Cathie Wood, believe it will mark a mass approval for all other filings in order to level the playing field for everyone. Some elements supporting the bullish theory are the fast-tracking of the regulator in the comment periods for Franklin Templeton and Hashdex’s Bitcoin ETF submissions to January 5. Another pivotal moment coming up in the Bitcoin network is the “halving.” This is a coded condition in the Bitcoin protocol increasing mining difficulty while lowering block rewards. The event triggers every 210,000 blocks mined, and the closest one is expected to occur on April 19, 2024. Analysts expect the event to drive emphasis on Bitcoin’s scarcity, which could catalyze a new valuation for the token."

This is going to allow crypto to be adopted by the next couple of billion people. But these companies have to make it easy and frictionless. Not everyone is tech savvy, and has to be easy enough where they can maybe have it through their current phone and apps and so forth.

2023-12-11 10:00:00+00:00,One Bitcoin Transaction Can Fill A Backyard Pool,https://blockzeit.com/one-bitcoin-transaction-can-fill-a-backyard-pool/,"New research finds that an average Bitcoin (BTC) transaction costs water that’s enough to fill a backyard pool. It adds up to the controversial energy usage of the cryptocurrency asset. Bitcoin mining does not only use electricity, it also needs water to cool the computers they rely on. Citing a study by Alex de Vries of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, BBC said the volume of water used for such purposes is six million times more than the usual consumption of a credit card swipe. The data shows Bitcoin drained up 1,600 billion liters or gigaliters (GL) of water in 2021. Fast-forward to 2023, the numbers were estimated to have grown to 2,200 GL. The massive amount of water used for Bitcoin is relative to the huge computing power it requires to mine it. A Cambridge University research noted that the power consumption of the Bitcoin network is around 146 TWh annually. That’s more than the yearly energy usage of Pakistan (132.3 TWh) and Ukraine (TWh) and slightly less than Malaysia (150.8 TWh) and Poland (158.2 TWh). Most coal- and gas-fed power plants where Bitcoin mining taps need water for cooling. Meanwhile, most of the liquid is lost through evaporation in hydroelectric plants. That does not even count the water used for the cooling of computers needed to run the “proof of work” concept of Bitcoin. It’s for this reason that Ethereum (ETH) switched to a “proof of stake” model last year to reduce its energy usage by 99%. Bitcoin cannot replicate this, however, given the more centralized state of ETH. University of Southampton Associate Professor of Finance Dr. Larisa Yarovaya commented that Bitcoin mining in areas already having difficulty accessing fresh water “should be a cause of concern among regulators and the public.” In October, Greenpeace USA, the Texas Coalition Against Cryptomining, and Navarro County locals united against the launch of Riot Platform’s new Bitcoin mining in Corsicana, Texas. They referred to the company as a “Bitcoin proof-of-waste miner,” and they believe the establishment of its operation in the city threatens to further burden the locality’s energy grid. They also raised apprehensions over the significant risk to the environment of its activities. Riot Platform positioned its Bitcoin mining rig in Corsicana to take advantage of Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) incentives. One of the rewards allows the platform to sell its discounted electricity at a premium to consumers when energy demand is high. Other benefits include the proximity of its facilities to the Navarro switch and easy access to scarce water sources. The heightened concerns revolving around Bitcoin once again come amid its rallying values, which are triggered by growing institutional adoption and massive accumulation by investors. At the end of last week, BTC surged to a new high never seen since May 2022, conquering the $44K mark before retracement. Despite these issues, the cryptocurrency remains strong as calls for its regulation are dampened by the overwhelming bullish sentiments towards it."
2023-12-08 10:47:13+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Breaks $44,000 As SEC Filings That Mention Bitcoin Hit 1074, Record High In November",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-breaks-44000/,"Bitcoin price witnessed a massive rally this past week, pushing the crypto market into the full-greed mode. The price of Bitcoin is $43,232 at the time of writing, which signifies a -0.72% drop in the past 24 hours and a 12.78% increase in the past 7 days.  Bitcoin dominance is up from last week’s 49.6%, showing the asset has gained more influence over the entire market. The total market cap of BTC increased by nearly $100 billion in just a week, hinting at the state of things when the bull market sets in well. Last week, Bitcoin price was at $38,000, trying to break above the local barrier that had formed there. The market sentiment for Bitcoin was extremely bullish but some form of market manipulation kept the price below $39,000. Despite the price suppression, Bitcoin price could be seen creeping up, forming higher lows and higher highs. Finally, Bitcoin broke past the earlier established resistance levels of  $38,900, $39,974 and $41,000. Bitcoin did better than expected and completely cleared the Supply zone, triggering the horde of Take Profits set there. BTC broke above the supply zone ($43,155) and formed a local high of $44,490, starting to retrace. There are now two scenarios that can play out for Bitcoin, and both involve a retracement back into the Supply Zone. There is probably liquidity sitting around this area. The retracements could drop to 41,100 and 37,900. A break of these two supports could see BTC fall into a consolidation pattern and move sideways between $32,000  and $40,000 before breaking higher. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages provide strong support at $36,700 and $30,000, respectively, giving us a clear picture of the boundaries within which Bitcoin can move. The bearish analysis may be rendered moot if good news breaks into the crypto market and Bitcoin pushes higher. Overhead resistances lie at $48,258, $52,856, and $58,958.Fun Fact: BTC only needs a 60% pump to break its all-time high price.

2023-12-08 04:00:00+00:00,"Counting Down: Bitcoin Halving Approaches With Less Than 20,000 Blocks To Go",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-halving-approaches/,"While the effect of Bitcoin beating the $44K mark still ripples across the crypto space, the coming months seem even brighter as there’s less than 20,000 blocks to the next Bitcoin halving. Every fours years, Bitcoin succumbs to a programming that reduces the rate at which it is mined by half. In any halving event, what happens is that the rate at which bitcoins are produced and made available on the blockchain is reduced by half, thus increasing the scarcity of the cryptocurrency.  The last halving event was in 2020, while the next is expected to happen in 2024. The goal is to get Bitcoin to the maximum supply of 21 million bitcoins by halving the mining rate and rewards every four years till the last bitcoin is mined in year 2140. The principle is not far from the demand and supply interplay in economics.  For conventional bitcoin holders, the best way to explain it is that it’s a three-legged event that affects bitcoin supply, miners, and then investors. What happens to the miners is that they get less compensation for their efforts, which in turn increases competition in their space – so not so much of a good news to them. Investors, however, enjoy improved security as only the most reliable and efficient miners remain and thrive in operation. Still, early investors before halving events also enjoy increased value of the cryptocurrency – while the increase in value eludes late market entrants. This web of events and Bitcoin’s deflationary nature is what puts its halving on the spotlight and commands the excitement of the entire crypto community. Preceding Bitcoin halving events will help give you an idea of how the occurrence has helped increase the coin’s market value. A halving event usually causes an appreciation in the price or market value of Bitcoin by garnering market sentiment and speculation, achieved by reducing the rate of Bitcoin issuance and evoking scarcity and demand. These series of events are then followed by investors anticipating price appreciation. The last three halving events prove that the principle has worked really well and raised hopes on  Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Back in November 2012, the first halving event happened when BTC was just $12. Fast forward to one year later, Bitcoin was almost $1,000. The second halving happened around July 2016 when BTC had dropped to $670, but appreciated to $2,550 in 2017 and later on saw a previous all-time-high of $19,700 in December of 2017. Then followed the May 2020 halving, which occured when BTC was $8,787, but later in November that year, it achieved an all-time high of close to $69,000. While the events later led to significant value increase, one could obviously notice that they didn’t happen immediately beacuse it often takes weeks, months, or over a year for the reduction in circulating bitcoins to trigger investors and reflect in the market. The dynamics of halving as seen consistently in the last 11 years give credence to the ability of the phenomenon to build anticipation of price increase. This in turn drives investor sentiment, followed by a post-halving price surge. The effect is then a lasting positive perception of Bitcoin and trust that the continuous reduction in supply will sustain it as the gold of cryptocurrencies."
2023-12-06 04:00:00+00:00,Coinbase CEO Says Bitcoin Is The Key To Extending Western Civilization,https://blockzeit.com/coinbase-ceo-says-bitcoin-is-the-key-to-extending-us-reach/,"The dramatic inflation of the US dollar is now causing concerns that it may lose its grip on the global market. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong thinks the only way it could retain its dominance is through Bitcoin (BTC). One idea I’ve been contemplating is that Bitcoin may be the key to extending western civilization.The natural trend of whichever country has the reserve currency is to inflate the money supply and increase deficit spending until it loses that advantage. The U.S. is somewhere on… US inflation was at 3.2% in October. It may be down from the 3.7% logged in September, but it is worrying, nonetheless. The stats are further made worse if the country’s ballooning $33.7 trillion debt is put in the equation. According to Forbes, the US dollar is facing a potential threat from the Chinese yuan. In the past few years, the giant Asian nation has been aggressively testing the implementation of its own central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan. State-owned Bank of China (BoC) is currently testing an offline version of its CBDC wallet that can be accessed through SIM cards and is piloting the use of the virtual yuan in some of its provinces. There are also unconfirmed reports that China is pushing for its adoption in the BRICS alliance. According to a recent post by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong on the X platform, the only way to prevent the dilution of the US dollar’s dominance in the world market is via Bitcoin. He stated that it “may be the key to extending Western civilization” amid the growing monetary threat from the East. “The natural trend of whichever country has the reserve currency is to inflate the money supply and increase deficit spending until it loses that advantage,” said Armstrong. “The US is somewhere on this journey.” The Coinbase boss added that both the yuan and the euro are presently not ready to replace the dollar as alternative currencies because of their issues. As the dollar continues to inflate, people may be forced to hedge their wealth using cryptocurrencies, which he referred to as “antidote to inflation.” Armstrong believes Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies do not pose a threat to the dollar. He explained that it is an instrument for check and balance, complementing the role of the US currency, and thus, protecting the interest of Americans. For him, it would be better to shift from dollars to crypto than have another country or region’s fiat. Furthermore, Armstrong forecasts fiat and crypto will continue to co-exist in the long run. Meanwhile, stablecoins like the USDC or flat coins can be the middle ground for both. As of Tuesday evening (UTC), Bitcoin price skipped over $44,000 before retracing at $43,850 at 9:30 PM. The most dominant cryptocurrency by market cap is around 5% up on the daily charts despite its trading volume dipping by 12.56% in the same period as it moved between a $41,421 low and a $44,062 high."
2023-12-05 10:00:00+00:00,What To Expect If The SEC Approves Bitcoin ETFs,https://blockzeit.com/what-if-the-sec-approves-bitcoin-etfs/,"The cryptocurrency community remains at a standstill in anticipation of a favorable ruling on Bitcoin ETFs since the approval of these ETFs promises bumper returns and implications for every Bitcoin investor. Window is officially Jan 5th to Jan 10th. Really this means that any potential approval orders are going to come on either Monday Jan 8, Tuesday Jan 9, or Wednesday Jan 10. Mark your calendars people. https://t.co/8ob8Y6pgU5 Recently, the SEC set an approval window between 5th and 10th January 2024 to present the final ruling on the 12 spot-Bitcoin ETF applications on the regulator’s table, including those of investment giant BlackRock and renowned asset manager Grayscale. Just within this period of intense anticipation, leading up to the January ruling, Bitcoin has already gained massively – over 150% – and surpassed the $40,000 mark around 11:50 PM UTC today, 4th December, with a 24-hour trading volume of about 15.4 billion. While some speculators may ascribe these gains to coincidence, other Bitcoin faithful and analysts are convinced these gains are a leadup to the SEC’s favorable ruling on BTC spot ETFs, all things being equal. However, spikes in prices of commodities after ETF approvals aren’t new at all. After the SEC gave a go-ahead to BlackRock’s Spot Gold ETF back in 2004, gold saw a mammoth price increase; upwards of 300%. Bitcoin has already surpassed the $42K mark with a daily trading volume of 29.26B as of 11:05 PM UTC today, Nov. 4. And Bitcoin has firmly held above the $41K for the past 8 hours as of this writing by 1:17 UTC, BTC has strongly held above the 41K mark and seems to have built a support at the 41.5K mark. If BTC proves surge this much leading up to the SEC ruling, then there’s likely to be greater activity around the cryptocurrency following ETF approvals. A potential approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs by the SEC will be a dream come true for the crypto world, considering the absence of regulation has been one of the major factors setting back giant exchanges like Binance and their chiefs billions of dollars in fines. Although the challenge doesn’t lie with Bitcoin itself, most people refraining from cryptocurrency investments do so because of its highly speculative nature. However, approving a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds could not only stabilize and increase BTC value, but also foster trust in the asset especially while trading as a regulated security. For consumer security and integrity concerns, many traditional and state-owned financial institutions are yet to lay down their reservations concerning Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investment and trading in general. The Spot-Bitcoin ETF batch, if approved, will be the first of its kind, and may break the traditional hedges around adopting and trading BTC like stocks and other securities. Institutions like the IMF (International Monetary Fund) consider cryptocurrency adoption over CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) inimical to both traditional state currencies and consumers at large, the ETF approval and future BTC utilities may increase the likelihood of them dropping their reservations."
2023-12-05 04:00:00+00:00,People Go FOMO Over Bitcoin As Price Pumps To $42K,https://blockzeit.com/people-go-fomo-over-bitcoin/,"The latest Bitcoin (BTC) rally finally tapped the $42,000 territory, a price not seen by the prime cryptocurrency by market cap for 19 months. Experts believe the spot Bitcoin ETF anticipation combined with prevailing economic conditions are now causing “panic buying” or FOMO over the digital coin. After clearing the $38,000 barrier last Friday, Bitcoin maintained its momentum towards the $42,000 line this Monday. The surge saw the digital asset climb around 5.8% in just 24 hours. According to Matrixport, many traders rushed to the market due to fear of missing out (FOMO) by the recent spike in Bitcoin price. The crypto investment services provider cited the high level of Bitcoin perpetual futures fees compared to spot price as a reference for its prognosis. “Traders do not have enough upside leverage, this is the conclusion from the elevated premium that perpetual futures are trading at,” Matrixport reported. The firm noted perpetual futures usually had a 5% to 10% premium, but it observed their fluctuation by 10% to 15% and even at 20% to 30% throughout the year. The surges indicated panic buying from traders either closing their short positions or increasing their leveraged long positions. The increased buying pressure in Bitcoin bloated the crypto market cap to more than $1.5 trillion, showing a 3% jump in just a day. It’s the first time the market to reached such heights since May 2022 during the Terra collapse. A month before it was also the last time BTC traded at $42,000. As of this writing at 1:00 AM UTC on Tuesday, Bitcoin is trading at around $41,770, displaying a nearly 4% gain in the 24-hour chart and 12% in the weekly. Transaction volume is up by 145% in just a day as $39.55 billion worth of BTC moved along wallets. During the timeframe, the digital asset traded went between a $39,978 low and a $42,372 high. The rise in prices pushed the market cap of Bitcoin by 3% to $817.25 billion. The current value is still 39% short from the all-time high witnessed on November 10, 2021. However, there is a growing optimism that it may not be long before Bitcoin could get there. The expected approval of multiple spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the US remains the key driving factor of the BTC pump. If analysts are correct, we may see multiple approvals of these financial instruments between January 5 to 10 next year. Another narrative at play is the upcoming halving estimated to happen on April 19, 2024. The halving event will cut Bitcoin mining reward by half from the present 6.25 BTC. The latest factors fueling the crypto community are expectations of lower interest rates and analysts chiming in their $500,000 per BTC forecasts for next year."
2023-12-04 12:00:00+00:00,Brace Yourself For Spot Bitcoin ETF Approvals By January,https://blockzeit.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-approval/,"Mark your calendars! Industry watchers predict that the US SEC may finally decide on the pending spot Bitcoin ETF applications within January 5 to 10, 2024. According to Bloomberg Intelligence’s James Seyffart, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could change its stance on spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETF). With that, the regulator may decide on the dozen of filings prior to the rumored January 10. The analyst plots the date as early as the fifth, with the most logical schedules falling from Monday to Wednesday or the eighth to tenth of the month. Seyffart attached notices signed by the SEC Division of Trading and Market’s Sherry Haywood in his post to drive his point. Window is officially Jan 5th to Jan 10th. Really this means that any potential approval orders are going to come on either Monday Jan 8, Tuesday Jan 9, or Wednesday Jan 10. Mark your calendars people. https://t.co/8ob8Y6pgU5 One of the latest top traditional finance (TradFi) institutions to join the spot Bitcoin ETF fray was Franklin Templeton. Last week, the SEC opened the comment period for the company’s bid earlier than expected, with the comment period extending until January 5. Comments on Hashdex’s application also fell on the same deadline. There’s a consensus saying that the SEC might be lining up all the filings so it could rule on them at the same time. Van Buren Capital general partner Scott Johnson, as quoted by Seyffart, said SEC will unlikely decide on the weekend after the fifth of January, so the following Monday to Wednesday should mark the pivotal event. January 10 happens to be the ultimatum for the SEC to nail its decision on the 21 Shares & Ark spot Bitcoin ETF submitted by Ark Invest back in June. Experts, including Ark CEO Cathie Wood, believe the regulator may approve everything on that date to level the playing field for everyone. Meanwhile, some in the opposition believe the SEC may still choose to deny the spot Bitcoin ETF requests. The agency could reiterate its concerns for potential market manipulation in its ruling similar to its reasoning for rejecting earlier applicants like Grayscale. By now, it should be very evident that the anticipation for spot Bitcoin ETF is a primary influence in the volatility of BTC. Roundtable’s Rob Nelson and Altcoin Daily’s Austin Arnold suspect both the US government and BlackRock may be onto something here. The analysts speculated that the parties may be intentionally manipulating the price of the cryptocurrency via the spot Bitcoin ETF hype so they could accumulate more of the digital asset when the price is low. The ultimate payoff would be the approval of the filings, which, together with the expected halving phenomenon in April, could inevitably shoot Bitcoin to the moon."
2023-12-04 10:00:00+00:00,Bitcoin Smashes The $41K Barrier,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-smashes-the-41k-barrier/,"The whole weekend has been a busy one for Bitcoin (BTC). After teasing a crossover in the $40K territory last Friday, the premier cryptocurrency by market dominance finally surpassed the $41K point, registering another all-time high not seen since April 2022. As of this writing at 9:00 AM UTC on Monday, Bitcoin’s (BTC) price sits at $41,750 recording an increase of almost 6% on the 24-hour chart. The transaction volume was also up by 64% as $25.89 billion worth of transactions took place on the network within the same period as the coin rallied from $39,000 to nearly $42,000 on crypto exchanges. The digital asset has seen over 150% rally as we approach the final days of 2023, thanks to the anticipation of multiple spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs). As a recap, the financial instrument would allow people to invest or trade based on the price movements of BTC without directly owning the crypto. “This idea that institutional money in US capital markets is going to have a legitimate, compliant avenue… the expectations are extremely high that that’s really going to take bitcoin to new levels,” Token Bay Capital founder Lucy Guzmarian said in a correspondence with Bloomberg. BTC is still around 39% away from its record-high valuation in November 2021 at $68,700, but market watchers are confident it will get there soon. Some even think it may surpass it due to pivotal events happening in 2024 for the coin. Aside from optimism in spot Bitcoin ETF approvals rumored to take place between January 5 to 10, there’s also the Bitcoin halving estimated to take place on April 19, 2024. A new psychological barrier for Bitcoin is now in place at $48,000 based on analysts. Surpassing that again could send the coin to all-new highs, which could finally let it overtake the November 2021 figures. What’s more, there’s the massive accumulation of traditional institutions of Bitcoin and crypto playing in the background, which is further driving bullish sentiments for the digital currency. To date, the biggest whales in the BTC community include: The pseudonymous cryptographer responsible for the creation of Bitcoin reportedly kept 1.1 million BTC distributed across wallets for over 14 years. The largest cryptocurrency exchange in North America may hold as much Bitcoin as Nakamoto based on Arkham Intelligence assessment. However, an examination of its public wallets and reserves only shows 947,755 BTC holdings. Grayscale has now positioned itself as the largest crypto asset manager globally with its 643,572 Bitcoin stash. Despite facing a mega lawsuit against US regulators, Binance remains the largest crypto exchange in the world with a Bitcoin haul between 498,147 and 600,000 units. The US government is the nation with the largest Bitcoin hoard. Thanks to a series of high-profile busts, it has gradually amassed 205,515 BTC in its coffers."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2023-12-04 04:00:00+00:00,"Will Spot Bitcoin ETF Approvals Be A ‘Buy The Rumor, Sell The News’ Event? – Let’s Discuss",https://blockzeit.com/will-spot-bitcoin-etf-approvals-be-a-buy-the-rumor-sell-the-news-event-lets-discuss/,"Bitcoin pushed through $39,000 and is currently trading hands at around $39,400. Things are looking really bullish as anticipation for Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals between January 5th-10th next year are closing in. JUST IN: SEC Spot #Bitcoin ETF potential approval window is between January 5th – 10th, 2024. Now, one of the things that we should be discussing is whether this could be a “buy the rumor, sell the news” type of event. When everyone is expecting new all-time highs or higher prices, or when the herd is looking, doing, and saying those things, you want to be doing the opposite. So we want to figure out where we are in that timeline, because I do not think we are there yet. But if Bitcoin pushes up another leg, memecoins and altcoins start popping up, retail comes back in, then that is a time to sell and take profits. Read: Bitcoin Surges Near $40K The longer #Bitcoin continues to climb towards 50k without an ETF approval the more I think this could be a sell the news event. Not trolling. One of the analysts said, “The longer Bitcoin continues to climb towards 50K without an ETF approval, the more I think this could be a sell the news event. Not trolling.” IMO despite #BTC reaching annual highs today there isn't the excitement matching it This past month installed a lot of fear, just a few days ago many were expecting a crash down to $32kWhen the euphoria returns I will be more skeptical but it appears the market is climbing a… https://t.co/eYXkLNjPoF Another statement from Matthew Hyland also highlighted the following, “In my opinion, despite Bitcoin reaching annual highs today, there isn’t the excitement matching it.” Based on Hyland’s first statement, he is absolutely right — a lot of people are not really excited and retail is not here yet. This past month instilled a lot of fear just a few days ago, and many were expecting a crash down to $32,000. Hyland continued, “When the euphoria returns, I will be more skeptical but it appears the market is climbing a wall of worry which is a very bullish sign overall. It’s almost incredible to fathom that there wouldn’t be excitement at this point. This to me suggests we are going to need much higher prices in order for the greed/euphoria to return.” So once again, the herd is not euphoric or super bullish. Yes, you have crypto people, myself, you guys, who are the small crowd right now, but when everybody is all talking about it, that is the time to be selling, right? Because many of them are not hodlers like you and I. Many of them are just tourists — they come with the herd, they see the prices going up and they think that is the time to buy. But we do not buy pumps — we buy when there is fear in the market. But unfortunately, a lot of people do not know that. Read: 5 Top Real World Asset Crypto To Keep An Eye On In The Next Bull Run Look, things could always change, but until they do, I am going to lean on the facts and what has played out historically. And that is Bitcoin having a retracement movement similar to what it did in 2019 and past bull markets — rallying off the bear market bottom and then hitting the retracement point, then rolling over to test some lows, and starting to work its way back up to new all-time highs. Altcoins will have their little mini bull market as well, and we will see what prices some of these altcoins hit. But I am not expecting new all-time highs — once these multiple ETFs are approved and it comes out, it will most likely be a ‘sell the news’ event, and we should be ready to take profits at that point."
2023-12-03 08:00:00+00:00,Bitcoin Surges Near $40K This Weekend,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-surges-to-40k/,"Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies do not show major movements on most weekends. However, the current one seems to deviate from the norm as the digital asset suddenly made an upward charge near the $40,000 territory. Bitcoin continues to gain the momentum it lost during the long crypto winter. The run to over $39,000 on Friday signified a record-high for the digital coin in 19 months. As of this writing at 4:00 AM UTC on Sunday, BTC is trading at $39,382 shaving off a couple of hundred from its peak within the 24-hour frame. The period saw a 28% decrease in the trading volume for the crypto to $15.894 billion as it pivoted from a $38,692 low to $39,698 based on CoinMarketCap data. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator on both the weekly and daily charts still displays a buy signal for BTC, but the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows the crypto asset around the overbought area in the weekly trend and dangerously close to it in the daily trend. Notwithstanding the technicals, there is a strong bullish consensus about Bitcoin. The hype around it is presently driven by the narratives of the impending approval of spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) and the halving both occurring next year. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is mandated to either approve or deny the 21Shares & ARK spot Bitcoin ETF application of Ark Invest on January 10. The investment management firm led by its CEO, Cathie Wood, is positioned to become the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the US following the failure of Grayscale to get a nod from the regulator last year. The SEC, however, appears to be rushing its request for comments in the spot Bitcoin ETF filings of Franklin Templeton and Hashdex. The decision of the agency led some industry watchers to believe that it may be targeting to decide on all applications come January 5, 2024. Even Wood echoes a similar sentiment, reasoning that doing so would level the playing field for the players in the sector. That’s because after Ark Invest’s spot Bitcoin ETF ultimatum, most of the final deadlines of the filings — including those from Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco & Galaxy, Wisdomtree, and VanEck — do not arrive until March of the same year. Bitcoiners should remain vigilant as the current investment trend is mainly triggered by two anticipated events in BTC’s economy. Even the charts are not 100% accurate in their predictions because sudden changes in the regulatory landscape or immediate shifts in market sentiment due to key macroeconomic events could shift the tide and further push volatility."
2023-12-01 10:16:15+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Firmly Above $38,300 As $29M Pando Asset Files For A Spot Bitcoin ETF With The SEC",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-above-38300/,"Bitcoin price experienced another push up to $38,362 region in an attempt to break the previous high of $38,457. The asset is still trying to push through this barrier, and from the look of things, it might. Meanwhile, Pando Asset, a Swiss Fund manager, has filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF application with the United States Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC). BREAKING: 🇨🇭$29M AuM Swiss Fund manager @PandoAsset just filed a spot Bitcoin ETF application with the SEC pic.twitter.com/lmk2mMJntr Pando Asset joins the growing list of asset fund managing companies filing for crypto-related ETFs. Bitcoin dominance rose to 49.6% from last week’s 49.3%, signifying that the total market cap of Altcoins shrank compared to BTC’s market cap. This is an indicator that Bitcoin has had a positive past week.  Congruently, BTC’s market cap has grown from $733 billion last Friday to $749 billion as of December 1, 2023. Bitcoin price previously tested the $38,300 region twice and was rejected. The current rally is the third test on this resistance level. Bitcoin has the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving average as supports at $34,800 and $30,290, respectively. Apart from these, other key support levels lie at $36,152 and $35,443. If Bitcoin manages to break above the $8,300 resistance, it still has to deal with $38,900 and $39,974 weak resistances, and after that, the final push to $41,000  will happen. UPDATE: Over the span of writing this article, Bitcoin broke the aforementioned barrier of $38,300 and is currently trading at $38,670. Fundamentally speaking, at this point in the current markets, the over-saturation of good news is beginning to lose the juice it once had. Perhaps the Pando Asset news is what caused BTC to rally earlier today, but a few months back, even a small firm as Pando would cause BTC to move in a much more volatile manner. The crypto fear and greed index is at 71 (Greed). It has been in the Greedy zone yesterday, last week, and even last month. What follows is usually a scare event that warrants smart money to snipe liquidity from leverage traders.So traders should keep a close eye on their running positions.DISCLAIMER: The work included in this article is based on current events, technical charts, company news releases, and the author’s opinions.

2023-11-29 16:00:00+00:00,"Jim Cramer Recommends Bitcoin, Are We Doomed?",https://blockzeit.com/jim-cramer-recommends-bitcoin/,"After pumping up over the past two months, Bitcoin (BTC) is now teasing the $40K line. Surprisingly, another one of the guys who kept bashing the cryptocurrency revealed he’s been a part of the bullish bandwagon all along, and that’s Jim Cramer. Considering many of his key predictions are often turning out to be the opposite, is the digital asset doomed? Jim Cramer admits he was wrong about selling #bitcoin#inversecramer pic.twitter.com/OyaWBFR37s Over the years, Mad Money host Jim Cramer has never been shy about lashing at Bitcoin. He often questioned its acceptance as currency and its reliability as a store of value. Early this year, he urged investors to “ignore crypto cheerleaders” and bet on gold instead. Fast-forward to the present, Cramer admitted he made a mistake about BTC. His change of tune came with a statement that it was “premature” for him to recommend selling the coin. “Look, if you like Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin. That has always been my view. And for a while, I liked it, and I decided that money had been made, but I was premature,” Cramer told Mad Money viewers on Wednesday. Now, here’s another plot twist. It turned out despite his negative comments on Bitcoin and telling people to stay away from it, Cramer admitted to having invested in it. In reality, the analyst said he “made a lot of money” from his investment in BTC. Critics of Cramer are now jokingly telling the crypto community that Bitcoin may be done for, referencing to the Inverse Cramer phenomenon. For context, the Inverse Cramer was coined by people displeased with the forecasts of the media personality, especially when it involved their favorite stocks or cryptos. It was so popular that even Elon Musk took a jab at this when he was replying to the social media post of Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus. The Force is strong with inverse Cramer It involves betting against every projection made by Cramer. So, for instance, if he tells people to sell Bitcoin, one must buy the asset instead. Some investors claimed to have made considerable profits from the application of the method, and other dedicated investors even put up a website called Inverse Cramer ETF to monitor every forecast made by the host. A previous study of Seeking Alpha tried to put this theory to the test by studying Cramer’s top 10 choices over a period, and then applying the Inverse Cramer strategy under certain conditions. The result was nothing short of impressive because the findings said if one had invested $100 million in the past two years using the technique, it would have compounded to $147.20 million as of January 2023. This unorthodox system, however, is not a reliable strategy, particularly in the existing setting wherein the charts and traditional institutions are now aligning towards a bullish scenario for BTC. It looks like Jim Cramer has been pulling an Inverse Cramer on himself all this time! While he was badmouthing Bitcoin in the media, he was actually investing in it secretly. I guess this development marks another win for Bitcoin."
2023-11-29 06:00:00+00:00,SEC Seeks Comment On Franklin Templeton Spot Bitcoin ETF,https://blockzeit.com/sec-franklin-templeton-spot-bitcoin-etf/,"The US SEC just opened the comment period earlier than anticipated for the Franklin Templeton spot Bitcoin ETF filed in September. The news is once again sparking hype for Bitcoin, but pundits warn of a potential “sell the news” event on longs when January 2024 hits. The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) initiation for the pending Franklin Templeton spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETF) came in prior to the expected schedule. “The commission seeks and encourages interested persons to provide comments on the proposed rule change,” the regulator announced on Tuesday. https://t.co/D6twjA1PpF pic.twitter.com/mPNyGVyFce The Franklin spot Bitcoin ETF’s second deadline comes on January 1, 2024, coinciding with the Hashdex spot Bitcoin ETF. Being late to the party, the ultimatum for SEC to decide whether it approves or denies the application is set for its final deadline on May 30, 2024. Industry experts like Van Buren Capital and Bloomberg’s James Seyffart see this as a move by SEC as a way to give it a window ahead of its deadline on January 10, 2024, thereby, fast-tracking the process. They are clearly pointing out the decision time for ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF of ARK Invest, which analysts predict may be the date when the commission will simultaneously give a go or a no to all similar filings. Going super early on Franklin today (and potentially @hashdex coming too?) would set things up for a full wave of approvals in early January. Might be the reasoning? pic.twitter.com/0WgNXvAZ4m There is, however, a pessimistic outlook for the January 10 event. That is the likely rejection of all spot Bitcoin ETF requests. To play it safe, there’s a possibility that traditional finance (TradFi) who went long on Bitcoin (BTC) may cash out before SEC’s decision time on spot Bitcoin ETFs. That’s if the opinion of former head of derivatives at capital markets firm Genesis Trading, Joshua Lim, is to be relied on. 1/ the CME futures roll traded at dizzying, near-historic wides during last week’s Nov to Dec roll window, touching 23%+ annualized at times, making it briefly one of the most attractive risk-adjusted trades in crypto pic.twitter.com/jVGtVtNMzq It’s becoming undeniable that the entry of more TradFi institutions in the game reinforces the bullish narrative for Bitcoin. But then again, the enthusiasm will probably get quashed before the awaited affair occurs due to the massive sell-offs in investors’ positions — a classic example of the “buy the rumor, sell the news” technique. Lim used the trend prior to the approval of the first Bitcoin futures ETF (BITO) and Coinbase (COIN) in 2021 as an illustration. Both listings peaked at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) as investors rallied, but they quickly dipped when people started taking profits nearing the end of the countdown. 8/ what does it all mean? tradfi is already long and probably thinking about when to exit this trade around etf announcement expect retail to pile in.. and expect tradfi guys to exit (2021 tops in basis were prior to $COIN and $BITO listings) pic.twitter.com/axih2FOUUo As of this writing at 4:00 AM UTC time, Bitcoin pumped over 2% to $37.9K in the daily chart in light of the spot ETF developments. The crypto likewise displayed over 21% trading volume over the timeframe as its price moved between a $36.89% low and a $38.36K high."
2023-11-28 06:00:00+00:00,Bitcoin Just Mooned Not In Value But In Mining Difficulty,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-67-96/,"On-chain data reveals that Bitcoin (BTC) mining difficulty is now at a record-high of 67.96 T, showing a 5.07% spike. Bitcoin mining difficulty ushered in a mining difficulty adjustment at block height 818496. The mining difficulty was raised by 5.07% to 67.96 T, continuing to hit a record high. The current average hashrate of the entire network is 504.80 EH/s. https://t.co/vgAkEgyDOf New metrics from BTC.com reveal that Bitcoin mining difficulty is now at 67.96 T (terahashes) with an average hashrate of 489.63 EH/s (exa hash per second). The adjustment in difficulty happened at block height 818496 of the network. The latest numbers indicate a record-high difficulty in Bitcoin mining with a 5.07% surge since the last update. Despite the skyrocketing figures, the source predicts that no iota of relief is coming in the next few weeks for miners because they are expected to further bump up by 0.43% to 68.25 T in 11 days as of this writing on Tuesday. Volatility in Bitcoin mining difficulty was very evident this year, going between a 10% peak in January and 7.3% dip in the early part of October. The metric configures itself every 2016 blocks — that’s about two calendar weeks — to keep the block time consistent. Block time is the period it takes to explore and introduce a new block into the blockchain. BTC mining difficulty is one of the basic safeguards of the Bitcoin blockchain to keep its Proof-of-Work (PoW) validation system stable. It is a unit utilized to gauge the complexity of the solution to the cryptographic puzzles used in the mining process of the network. Additionally, it estimates the time it takes to look for the right hash for each block in the network. The instrument is a controlling mechanism that adjusts based on the number of Bitcoin miners in the system. As shown in the example here, it increases and decreases along the way to ensure the target block time. There’s no 100% accurate prediction pertaining to the exact schedule of the next Bitcoin halving. However, it happens every four years and forecasts plot the next event on April 19, 2024. The phenomenon will occur at the 840,000 block time range. Every halving comes with a harder process and time to mine a new block in Bitcoin, and this will be a cycle until the 21 million cap of BTC is reached. So, it gets more challenging from here if the currently staggering rate is put into the equation. By next year, the reward for miners will be stricken from the present 6.25 to 3.125 BTC per block. At the moment, there are 19.554 million BTC in circulation, leaving around 1.446 million more to be mined by our next generation until the supplies run out sometime in 2140."
2023-11-24 09:42:29+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Explores New Ranging Zone Amid Binance Debacle,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-explores-new-ranging-zone-amid-binance-debacle/,"This week, Bitcoin’s price crashed to $35,965 after the United States Securities and Exchanges COmmision came after Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao. As of November 24, 2023, 8:23 AM UTC, BTC is trading at  $37,522.96 with a 24-hour trading volume of $12,932,223,949.40. This is a 3.51% price increase in the past seven days and a 0.14% increase in the past 24 hours. Last week, Bitcoin’s bearish divergence forming on the daily chart threatened to spoil the fun. Bitcoin needed to break above $37,486 to test $40,000. The pull to the $40k region is inevitable since much liquidity is sitting there, which the Market Makers need to scoop up. For this reason, we might see an aggressive move to the upside. Earlier this week, Javier Milei, the pro-Bitcoin Argentinian presidential candidate, won the elections, and in turn, BTC’s price pumped a little. However, the move had no momentum as the president-elect received negative light from mainstream media. The news of the SEC’s lawsuit against Binance provided the necessary FUD to push Bitcoin’s price down. However, the bulls proved to be more resilient. SEC managed to oust Changpeng Zhao from Binance’s leadership and replaced him with Richard Teng, an individual deep in the World Economic Forum (WEF) clutches. These events resulted in uncertainty in the market, causing BTC prices to enter a short-term range that turned out to be an ascending triangle. We expect to see Bitcoin breakout of this ascending triangle in the coming days and weeks. The profit target for this breakout is 9.10% from the breakout point, setting BTC at $41,500. There would need to be major fundamental news to enable this push to the upside. A Bitcoin Spot ETF could be in sight as BlackRock representatives met with the SEC to discuss the possibility of listing a spot Bitcoin ETF. Shortly after, they filed a new Bitcoin ETF application. In the spirit of ‘getting there first’, Fidelity was rumored to buy Grayscale or file a spot Bitcoin  ETF application to compete with BlackRock. Following Blackrock’s footsteps, Grayscale files updated the Bitcoin ETF prospectus days after talks with the U.S. SEC. All this occurs in the wake of CZ stepping down as CEO of Binance and WEF-controlled Richard Teng taking the reins.

2023-11-22 04:00:00+00:00,Ordinals Stage A Comeback Driving Up Bitcoin Transaction Fees,https://blockzeit.com/ordinals-drive-up-bitcoin-fees/,"Just when many thought that the Ordinals hype had already been extinguished, the protocol built within the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain comes rallying again, bringing about more activity in the network but also kicking in higher transaction fees. Last Thursday, the Bitcoin network was rocked by surging activity coupled with rising fees. The culprit here was the resurgence of Ordinals due to seemingly renewed market appetite by enthusiasts. As a recap, Ordinals Protocol was formulated by Casey Rodarmor, allowing data to be infused in a Satoshi (Sat)—the smallest denomination of Bitcoin. Ordinals are similar to how non-fungible tokens (NFT) on the Ethereum (ETH) chain work, but their proponents and users have taken a great deal of effort differentiating the two by referring to the former as Bitcoin-native Digital Artifacts. The distinction was apparently very important for them because of the “tainted” nature of NFTs, which were prone to scams. The peak of the transactions came on November 16 and 18, which consequently pumped average fees to $18.647 and $18.378, respectively, based on BitInfoChart’s three-month data. Prior to that, a notable uptick was noticed a week before with the charges bumping at $15.865. As of Monday, the numbers have gone down but at $10.346, they are still higher than the average fees on the second half of the year. All these times, Ethereum was playing catch up and mirroring Bitcoin’s movements in the three-month bracket, except for the November 16 and 18 events. During the 9th, ETH spiked to $10.529 and has overtaken BTC by $2.018 on the 13th. However, it eventually diverged from the premier crypto by market dominance on the 16th and 18th, displaying $7.989 and $4.888 transaction fees, accordingly. The data is reinforced by Dune Analytics charts indicating a dramatic increase in Ordinal inscriptions since October 24. On that date, more than six million Ordinals were inscribed, catapulting the total network fees to 800 BTC or around $30 million. As of this writing at 3:30 PM UTC time on Tuesday, there are now a total of 42.67 million Ordinal inscriptions on the BTC network. The reinvigorated Ordinals demand gave way to the listing of ORDI on Binance on November 7. The inclusion of the second largest BRC-20 token by market cap on the crypto exchange resulted in a buying spree, pumping its price by 50% at that time. Additionally, the renewed in Ordinals sprouted a $7.5 million seed from the November 17 funding round of Taproot Wizards, an Ordinals-based project led by Rodarmor."
2023-11-21 10:00:00+00:00,Futures And Spot Bitcoin ETFs Set On A Collision Course,https://blockzeit.com/futures-and-spot-bitcoin-etfs/,"The coming weeks will be a litmus test for futures Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the US as the Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to decide on the fate of their pending spot ETF counterparts. Two years ago, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) became the fastest ETF to gain $1 billion assets. Currently standing at a $1.4 billion valuation, BITO tracks Bitcoin through futures contracts. However, the landscape is about to shift with the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which could open up cost-effective alternatives for investors. SEC faces an ultimatum to approve or deny pending spot Bitcoin ETFs by January 10. These financial instruments have reaped growing interest from both the traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto community following the legal setback of the regulator in its Bitcoin ETF-related lawsuit. Industry insiders believe that regulators might greenlight spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. The industry is expected to pivot from the futures-based to spot-based Bitcoin ETFs—upon approval. While the former retains short-term trading utility, long-term investors and financial advisers may lean towards the latter said WisdomTree Head of Digital Assets Will Peck. Presently, US regulators are wary about the risk of market manipulation in spot Bitcoin ETF markets. These are further exacerbated by the token’s illiquidity. Despite these reservations, proponents of spot Bitcoin ETFs are pushing the idea that the absence of intermediary in the model of spot Bitcoin ETFs as opposed to the nature of futures contracts is an advantage that could outweigh the perceived risks. On the other side of the fence, some industry experts believe that both futures and spot ETFs can actually coexist. ProShares CEO Michael Sapir says the support of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as well as other TradFi institutions towards futures-based Bitcoin ETFs will keep them appealing to investors. The torrent of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, including those by powerhouses BlackRock, Ark Investment Management, Fidelity, and Invesco are sure to sway interest from their futures-based versions. Their simultaneous approval could threaten the relevance of Bitcoin ETFs on various fronts, including brand differentiation, distribution strategies, and fees. The exemption of spot Bitcoin ETFs from the levies of futures Bitcoin ETFs is anticipated to be a major selling point for investors."
2023-11-20 14:00:00+00:00,Will Argentina Make Bitcoin A Legal Tender?,https://blockzeit.com/argentina-bitcoin-legal-tender/,"Javier Milei is not one to hesitate when it comes to exercise of free speech. This has won him the votes of Argentinians in the 2023 presidential elections. The country’s head of state has been a vocal supporter of Bitcoin (BTC), too, which leaves the question whether or not he will follow El Salvador’s stride in making the cryptocurrency a legal tender. Argentines celebrating out in the streets Javier Milei’s win in the presidential election.Many think that this could be the end of nearly 80 years of Peronism in the country.🇦🇷 pic.twitter.com/slJxdNBUpb Argentina’s hyperinflation is blamed on the peso’s devaluation. To date, the Argentine peso has inflated by 143% and this trend is not showing any signs of stopping any time soon—unless Javier Milei will be able to implement monetary reforms to ease tensions. Milei is not shy of criticizing his country’s central bank. He called it a “scam” and a tool used by “politicians to cheat the good people with inflationary tax.” The politician is known as a strong advocate for the adoption of Bitcoin, and he says it “represents the return of money to its original creator, the private sector.” He added that the cryptocurrency “prevents politicians from robbing you through inflation.” “With legal tender, they scam you with the inflationary tax… #Bitcoin is the natural reaction against central bank scammers; to make money private again.” – Javier Milei, President of Argentina 🇦🇷🇦🇷pic.twitter.com/Rs2yXFo4e7 With that, Milei’s win is considered as game-changer for Bitcoin, but we are yet to find out his stance on the subject of making the coin a legal tender or a reserve asset. However, he stated in the past that he is looking to phase out the peso in favor of the US dollar. Despite his lack of concrete plan for BTC, the crypto community is expecting Milei to make sweeping changes that could pave way for the digital asset’s adoption—mirroring the move of El Salvador. Milei’s position comes off as surprising considering that he built up his reputation around the traditional finance (TradFi) sector, serving as Chief Economist at Corporación América International and being listed at the World Economic Forum (WEC). Milei snagged victory against Sergio Massa, the country’s Minister of Economy, with the former getting over 13 million votes against the latter’s 10 million, translating to 55.89%-44.11% margin. The president-elect will take the helm of Casa Rosada on December 10. The populist president’s often eccentric acts against the mainstream media plus evident disdain for the leftist and “woke” propaganda has earned him the moniker the “Trump of Argentina.” Congratulations, Argentina! 🇦🇷🇦🇷The Javier Milei era has begun and it should be interesting to say the least.Many in the US have compared him to a Ron Paul/Donald Trump hybrid.Here's Milei celebrating his big win tonight 🔥 pic.twitter.com/DW93nUIhhz The connection of Milei and Bitcoin caused the digital currency to jump by 1.39% to over $37,500 in the immediate aftermath of the Argentinian presidential election. As of this writing at 12:00 PM UTC time on Monday, Bitcoin seems to be maintaining its momentum, displaying a 1.75% rise in the 24-hour frame. Trading volume is significantly up by 37.71% during the same period as the coin swung between a $36,414.60 low and $37,509.36 high."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."

The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2023-11-20 10:00:00+00:00,Bitcoin And Ethereum Supplies At Their Lowest,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-supplies-at-their-lowest/,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) supplies are now hitting an all-time scarcity. Onchain data shows that only 30% of Bitcoin and 39% of Ethereum changed hands in 2022 to the present. According to historical info obtained by The Block, the respective 30.12% and 39.15% movements of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past year represent the lowest values since data gathering started in 2017. The most Bitcoin transfers happened between March 2017 and 2018. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s peak activity was recorded between July 2016 and 2017 just a year after its network went live. The chart below shows the active supply of both cryptocurrencies from 2017 to present: The dipping supply of Bitcoin was attributed to the upcoming halving event expected to take place in April 2024. Zooming out the charts reveals that the five-year active supply decreased from 83% to 70.13%. Zooming in on the three-year timeframe also indicates dwindling active supply from the peak of 73% in 2019 to the past three years’ 58.58%. Additionally, network transactions have surged in the background pushing the fees up. This was fueled by the introduction of Ordinals clogging the network early this year—logging a record-high on May 12 and the protocol exceeding a total market value of $900 million. The Block’s analyst suspects that the rising transaction charges may be hindering the volume of transactions in Bitcoin, too. Separate data by Dune Analytics revealed that BTC transaction charges have spiked from $779,649 at the start of November to $11.63 million three days ago. The figures translate to an increase of $1,391%. The long “HODL” on BTC can be further credited to the anticipated resolution of the US Securities and Exchange Commission to the spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) by financial powerhouses like BlackRock, Grayscale, Ark Invest, and Fidelity, among others. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC time, Bitcoin is priced at $37,220—showing a 1.5% climb coinciding with the election of pro-Bitcoin Javier Milei as president of Argentina. The coin experienced reinvigoration in trading volume by 23.76% as its value swung from $36,414 low to $37,509 high. Overall, the crypto community has a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins due to existing market conditions and the growing participation of traditional finance (TradFi) in the adoption of these digital assets. The receding active supply of Bitcoin and impending increase in the difficulty of Bitcoin mining amid the aggressive hoarding of financial institutions shows a consistently rising demand for the digital commodity. As per the basic law of supply and demand, the latter exceeding the former can drive prices up, which reinforces the bullish case of the digital asset in the year to come."
2023-11-20 08:00:00+00:00,Why The SEC Is Hesitant To Approve A Bitcoin Spot ETF And Why It Matters,https://blockzeit.com/why-sec-is-hesitant-to-approve-bitcoin-spot-etf/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been reviewing several applications for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) for years, yet none have been approved. How can that be? Let’s take a closer look at it. There are two primary types of Bitcoin ETFs: spot and futures. A spot ETF directly holds Bitcoin in a custodial account, reflecting Bitcoin’s current market price. In contrast, a futures ETF does not hold Bitcoin; it invests in Bitcoin futures contracts, agreements to buy or sell Bitcoin at a future date and specified price. Due to factors like supply and demand, fees, and expiration dates, a futures ETF’s value may deviate from Bitcoin’s actual price. While the SEC has approved several Bitcoin futures ETFs, such as the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which have attracted billions in assets under management, it has hesitated to approve a Bitcoin spot ETF. The SEC’s concerns include potential market manipulation, fraud, custody issues, and investor protection. One key reason for the SEC’s hesitation is the lack of regulation and oversight in the underlying Bitcoin market. Unlike the futures market, regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the spot market is largely unregulated and decentralized. Hundreds of exchanges and platforms operate in different jurisdictions with varied transparency and security levels. The SEC fears that the spot market’s vulnerability to manipulation, hacking, theft, and other illicit activities could harm investors and undermine the ETF’s integrity. Another concern for the SEC is ensuring the safe and reliable custody of Bitcoin. Unlike traditional assets, which trusted intermediaries like brokers and custodians hold, Bitcoin is stored in digital wallets controlled by private keys. The SEC is concerned about operational, technical, and legal risks associated with Bitcoin custody, such as loss, theft, or compromise of private keys, hacking or malfunctioning of wallets, and unclear Bitcoin ownership and liability. Despite the SEC’s reservations, many experts advocate for the benefits of a Bitcoin spot ETF for the crypto industry and the broader financial system. Approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by the SEC would be seen as a significant milestone and catalyst, signaling Bitcoin’s recognition and acceptance as a legitimate asset class. However, the SEC has not indicated when or if it will approve a Bitcoin spot ETF, repeatedly delaying or rejecting various ETF providers’ applications, like Fidelity, BlackRock, and Grayscale. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has expressed a preference for a futures-based ETF over a spot-based one and has called for more authority and resources for the SEC to regulate the crypto market. As the crypto community awaits the SEC’s decision on a Bitcoin spot ETF, interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies continues to grow, as evidenced by rising prices, trading volumes, and adoption of crypto assets.”"
2023-11-20 06:00:00+00:00,We Might See Bitcoin In The $50K Territory,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-in-50k/,"A popular cryptocurrency trader says that Bitcoin (BTC) may tap the $50K mark before the halving. However, he says “patience is key” on the way to that price. The statement came from the pseudonymous trader, Titan of Crypto, on the X platform (formerly Twitter) last year. Fast-forward on November 19, he once again reiterated the BTC target zone between $39K to $50K to his over 53.7K followers. Titan of Crypto explains that each rally that happened prior to each halving period “topped within the 61.8%-78.6% Fibonacci retracement area,” and this is where the figures on his forecast were from. #Bitcoin Pre Halving Rally Update. 🚀The pre halving rally I told you about one year ago is about to reach its target zone between $39k-$50kPatience is key. 🫡 pic.twitter.com/UOAa1gFsE3 Crypto trader Mags expressed his support to the bullish outlook on Bitcoin in a reply to Titan of Crypto. It went with an alternative strategy suggesting about buying Bitcoin 500 days before halving and then holding on to them until the next 500 days post-halving. No target price was set on the crypto on this one but the chart he provided implied that it may be between 90K and 140K range. #Bitcoin Simple Strategy 🤝1) Buy Bitcoins 500 days Before Halving 2) Hold & Do Nothing3) Sell 500 Days After Halving 4) Repeat pic.twitter.com/65F3TU8YgY Meanwhile, DecenTrader Co-Founder Filbfilb laid down a more conservative peak of $46K for Bitcoin before the monumental event. And when the fireworks settle in the aftermath of the halving, he projects the token lying at $130K by 2025. On the flip side, a correction dipping at the $30.9 line is also being shoved on the table. But then again, many believe that it is only a part of Bitcoin’s cycle as it tests liquidity. There is no definite date for the halving phenomenon, but Nasdaq estimates it to be sometime in April 2024. Bitcoin is hovering around $36,570 as of this writing at 5:00 UTC time on Sunday. The numbers from the on-chain metrics of Coinmarketcap represent 0.20% less than the valuation of the digital asset 24 hours ago as it went on a high of $36,786 and low of $36,414. The trading volume of the token had a double-digit slump at 32.4%. Still, the highest value attained by BTC was $68,789 two years ago on November 10, 2021. Based on the said data, it is no longer impossible for the digital currency to reach $50K, or even more if this resistance is surpassed. The crypto gods may be smiling on Bitcoin right now as anticipation for the halving is also coupled with positive viewpoint regarding the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Taking this factor into account could further push an uptrend for BTC before and during its ride up next year."
2023-11-18 08:00:00+00:00,BitGo CEO Predicts A Sweeping Rejection Of All Spot Bitcoin ETF Applications,https://blockzeit.com/bitgo-ceo-predicts-spot-bitcoin-etfs-rejection/,"Over the past few months, most members of the cryptocurrency community have been salivating at the potential approval of a flurry of spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETF) filed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, don’t get your hopes up too much because BitGo CEO Mike Belshe just gave his bleak prediction of what may be in store for the pending applications on the table of the regulator. In an interview with Bloomberg, the BitGo boss stated that the SEC will “quite likely” reject all the spot Bitcoin ETF filings. The head of the Palo Alto-based digital asset trust company said that the regulator might justify its move on the basis that exchanges and custody are not separated. He may have a good point for this as a number of the applicants have elected Coinbase as the custody partner of their ETFs. Belshe clarified that while Coinbase is in no way another FTX in the making, the company appears to be operating based on the same playbook that Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) presented 15 months ago in Congress when the fallen CEO of the doomed crypto exchange proposed his “seven key points of regulation.” It was in that instance wherein SBF lobbied for involvement in all the functions he proposed for the sake of efficiency. For the BitGo CEO, Coinbase must take a great deal of effort to keep its exchange and custody entities apart in the eyes of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) to give way for spot Bitcoin ETF approvals. At the end of the interview, Belshe took the opportunity to plug his company as the key to the spot Bitcoin ETF predicament. He explained BitGo 100% focuses on digital asset custody and it does not do any trading or exchange, hence, it could fill the missing piece of the puzzle towards the Bitcoin ETF filing approvals. The full interview of Belshe last Friday can be viewed here: As of this writing at 4:00 PM UTC time, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at the $36,140 bracket, showing a dip by 1% in the 24-hour frame. The same period also saw trading volume dive by 19% to $24.2 billion. Over the same span, the premier cryptocurrency in market dominance swung between $35,545 low to $36,646 high. As reported by my colleague earlier, the highest price of BTC last week was at $37,975 during Wednesday. However, the momentum eventually faded as the digital asset tanked back to $35,000. With that said, were there other factors at play during the botched rally? Some argue that market manipulation may have been a deterrence for Bitcoin gaining another major high this year."
2023-11-17 10:01:26+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Rejected At $38k As ETF Rumors Rock The Crypto Space,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-rejected-at-38k/,"Bitcoin price rose sharply and touched $37,975 on Wednesday, Nov 15, 2023, before returning to the $35,000 level. Some argue that market manipulation plays out the best in these times of rising prices. In the fall from ~$38,000 to ~$35,100, over $367 million in liquidations. Over 103,000 traders got liquidated, with the most significant single liquidation happening on OKX, where the trader lost $9.45 million. Last week, Bitcoin price increased by over 10%, and indicators showed the asset might add to its gains. The moving averages (50 & 200) provided support at $35,388 and $32,543. The road ahead was clear for BTC to attempt a run for $40,000.  However, this week, the asset only tested last week’s high of $37,973. While BTC reached this level, it did not exceed it and returned to $35,000. Those are two rejected attempts in two weeks. Bitcoin now braces itself to test the local resistance for a third time. As they say, the third time’s a charm. What would help BTC break out is some good news – which it has been receiving much of lately. Read: Bitcoin Millionaires Grow By 215% Bitcoin is dead in the middle of newly formed demand and supply zones and needs to decide soon. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages provide support at $32,819 and $29,055.  Apart from these two, key support levels for Bitcoin on the Daily timeframe lie at $28,821 and $26,776, while resistance levels are at $37,486 and $40,796. Based on previous Bitcoin history, the new supply zone at the $40,000 level is where many Sell Limit orders and buy stops have been set. Hence, it makes sense for Market makers to push the price to that level and scoop the liquidity nested there. Bitcoin price action and RSI (14) are moving in different directions. In technical analysis, this is called bearish divergence. Bearish divergence is a great and subtle indicator since when it forms, the general market sentiment is ‘bullish,’ hence, the reversal is usually rapid and unexpected. The bearish divergence should result in BTC returning to the 200-day moving average, but it may not happen before the asset touches the $40,000 level.

Since then, Blackrock has contacted the police to investigate the matter. The Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas broke the news and dispelled it as fake – suspicious, right? I think the whole thing was a psychological operation to confuse the market. This is true because two days later, on November 16, 2023, Blackrock filed the S-1 prospectus for its Spot Ethereum ETF with the SEC. It is a game of confusion; only those who can filter out the noise will emerge as winners. Our key dates remain intact: Nov. 17, 2023, Nov. 18, 2023, Nov. 19, 2023, and Nov. 20, 2023.

On-chain metrics placed the value of the coins around $2.22 billion. While there is a possibility of whales cashing in on the pump, it’s also possible that some may only be redistributing their holdings in different wallets. In addition, the popular X user noticed a major move from Bitcoin miners in the past couple of weeks. According to the analyst, these crypto miners have unpacked around 5,000 BTC, estimated to cost $175 million during that span. Another newsworthy tweet from Martinez during the week was his bearish prediction for Bitcoin. The trader warned that BTC may slide to the $33K territory if the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator is to be believed. As a side note, the TD Sequential displays a series of price points that may result in trend reversals. Martinez stated that the sell signal shown by the indicator on the weekly chart comes amid Bitcoin’s struggle to pass up the $38.5K and $42K resistance levels. The analyst explained that the scenario could be a catalyst for a correction down the $33K line. Although Martinez said that he is not touching his spot BTC position until 2025, he is enticed to enter a short in the futures market—given the aforementioned data based on the TD Sequential. The crypto sleuth revealed that he plans to buy the dip before the uptrend continues. But then again, the trader recommended looking for an invalidation point above the $42.5 range. #Bitcoin is nearing $40,000, and the crowd couldn't be more excited. But one important rule in trading is that you cannot follow the herd. Although I'm not touching my spot $BTC position until some time in 2025, I'm inclined to enter a short in the futures market. Want to… pic.twitter.com/dHZbHeKe6Y As of this writing at 3:30 PM UTC time, Bitcoin is down by 1.9% on the 24-hour chart trading as it hovers $36,090. It should be noted though that the trading volume of the asset was up by 28% during the same timeframe while it swung between $36K and $37K. The price of BTC reflected the below-market expectations regarding the US inflation rate. Based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), consumer prices only increased by 3.2% YoY. It reflected the same figures in October but has 0.4% difference compared to September numbers. Ali Martinez paints two contrasting outlook for Bitcoin. One for short-term play and the other is for long-term HODL. These are sound analogies indeed, especially that they all coincide with the technical charts. However, do remember that cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, can immediately change their course without much warning. As always, readers are advised to exercise discretion in their trades and conduct due diligence in their own research rather than falling into the pitfalls of hype or opinionated guesses."
2023-11-15 10:00:00+00:00,What You Need To Know About Bitcoin Spot ETF Fees — Is It Worth It?,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-spot-etf-fees-is-it-worth-it/,"Bitcoin (and recently Ethereum) Spot ETFs are almost guaranteed to get approved as we have massive names like Fidelity and BlackRock that are on the list. And we all know that BlackRock gets what BlackRock wants whenever they ask, that is neither here nor there. Many have been a big advocate for Bitcoin spot ETFs but many are also against it for the reason being is that they are predatory — the true intent and purpose of Bitcoin was to allow regular people like you and me to actually have complete ownership of our money. I do understand that a Bitcoin spot ETF might be good for a select few people — maybe the older generation want to have exposure to Bitcoin without having to create a wallet because self custody is hard. But the reason why self custody is so hard is because you get a great reward for actually holding on to your assets. And in fact, when you custody your own crypto assets, it does not really cost you anything. Read: Bitcoin ETFs: A Comprehensive Guide However, an article was just posted about some of the Bitcoin spot ETF fees and the post came from Bitcoin News. Those seeking to HODL #Bitcoin with a spot ETF are in for a rude awakening 😮Fees will eat a significant portion of your holdings over the long term 👀 pic.twitter.com/epPSh2Ryvk And it is kind of common knowledge that traditional financial products like ETFs charge you about a 1% fee essentially to “manage” your assets.  Another thing people do not talk about is the management or entity that is custodying your assets — if they happen to file for bankruptcy and they are not bailed out, you could lose those assets (but that is a topic for another time). Read: Hong Kong’s SFC Now Considering Spot Crypto ETFs Let’s talk about some of the fees for a Bitcoin spot ETF and how it compares to just actually holding your own Bitcoin and being responsible. Let’s assume you are living in the US and the balance after 30 years for self custody is 100% but for an ETF, it is 73.97%. And for an IRA (Individual Retirement Account) fee plus the ETF fee, it is 54.55% after 30 years. Yes you read that correctly — so if you have a Bitcoin spot ETF, you are going to get charged an IRA fee PLUS the ETF fee; and you are going to lose almost 50% of your Bitcoin. Even if you just hold the Bitcoin spot ETF with just the ETF fee, you are going to lose about 25% of your Bitcoin as opposed to retaining 100%. Read: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF Progress Signals Optimism In The Crypto Market So again I understand the arguments for wanting to have a Bitcoin spot ETF and trusting somebody else to custody your Bitcoin for you. But at the end of the day, that is not Bitcoin’s true intended purpose and it is just more than a predatory tactic from the traditional financial institutions that are coming in and taking from the retail investors."
2023-11-13 10:00:00+00:00,Bitcoin Millionaires Grow By 215%,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-millionaires/,"As of November 12, there are now 88,628 Bitcoin (BTC) millionaires, a surge from 28,084 reported as of January 5. This sudden spike of Bitcoin millionaires represents 215% increase over 2023, displaying threefold growth. This is probably based on only on-chain data. 🤷‍♂️But please don't FOMO. 🙏—Over 60,000 Bitcoin millionaires emerge in 2023, 3x more since January https://t.co/Yfs6fr8mPR Crunching the data, addresses that hold at least $1 million worth of Bitcoin currently stand at 81,962, with wallet addresses holding $10 million or more totaling 6,666. In comparison to the January 5th records, there were 28,084 millionaires holding at least $1 million worth of Bitcoin through 24,279 addresses; 3.805 more had at least $10 million according to data found through Wayback Machine web archive. Bitcoin millionaires have seen their ranks rapidly expand thanks to an upward trend in its price, pushing Bitcoin past $30,000. For most of 2018, its value had hovered just beneath this benchmark threshold before ultimately surpassing $37,000. Bitcoin millionaires formed an exclusive group that struggled with bearish sentiment in January, particularly amid macroeconomic factors and events like the collapse of FTX crypto exchange. Amid setbacks, their investments aimed for new all-time highs. Bitcoin is at $37,050 as of this writing, showing only around negative 0.40% sideways movement in 24 hours. However, it should be noted that trading volume for the digital asset was up by 2% in the same period. The numbers represent over 120% growth this year alone. Bitcoin’s recent surge can be attributed to several factors. Anticipation for approval of its first spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the US has provided one such factor; thus contributing significantly to this ongoing rally. Finbold reports indicate there may be twelve Bitcoin ETF applications approved within a week by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The applicants include global investment firm BlackRock’s application; their potential approval could have major ramifications on market performance should it take place. Analysts maintain that Bitcoin’s current momentum could set in motion one of its greatest bull runs ever seen in history. This could be further fueled by the anticipation of the halving phenomenon happening April next year. Speaking of ETFs, there’s an ongoing debate as to whether or not the foreseen approval of the BlackRock ETF in the US has already been factored in the present value of BTC. Roundtable’s Rob Nelson believes that the crypto may double, or even triple, should the new financial instruments get a green light from the regulator on the way to the halving event. Meanwhile, CleanSpark executive chair and co-founder Matt Schultz opined that the resulting scarcity of BTC in the aftermath of the halving could drive up prices by 50%."
2023-11-13 04:00:00+00:00,Europac’s Peter Schiff Bets On Bitcoin Price Crash Prior To ETF Launch,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-crash/,"Peter Schiff, chief economist and global strategy at asset management company Europac, who is fond of criticizing Bitcoin (BTC), has repeatedly insisted over the years that the digital asset’s value will return to zero and that nobody wants to hold it unless they want to sell it higher in the future. With BTC/USD at 18-month highs now, he is focusing on what many believe will be a major moment in cryptocurrency: the launch of America’s first Bitcoin Spot Price Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Rumors that the approval could be given in November are believed to have driven last week’s rise past $37,000. Schiff believes that the BTC price may drop before the ETF announcement. While others believe the announcement will lead to a “sell-the-news” event where investors reduce their exposure as soon as they are certain about the ETF. In an X poll on November 9, he presented two scenarios of a BTC crash—one before the ETF launch and another after. The other option was to “buy and HODL until the moon” which ended up being the most popular with 68% out of nearly 25,000 votes. Despite all this, however, Schiff refused to back down. He responded, “Based on results, my guess is that Bitcoin will crash before the ETF launches.” “That’s why people who bought rumors won’t make money if they sell before the facts are known.” When will #Bitcoin crash? On the other hand, AllianceBernstein presents a bullish outlook for BTC, but not for this year. The global asset management firm predicts that the coin may peak $150,000 by the 2025 cycle. The delay may lead to the disappointment of HODLers looking to cash in from the expected windfall of the US spot Bitcoin ETF approvals and halving hypes of Bitcoin, but the chart shown below—provided by the company to Marketwatch—presents a persuasive motivation for investors to exercise patience. As of this writing at 6:00 PM (UTC time) on Sunday, BTC has stagnated at around $37,000 moving modestly between $37,227 and $36,773 intraday. Meanwhile, the trading volume of the crypto within the same timeframe was down by 19% to $12 billion. The recent filings of high-grade institutions to the US Securities and Exchange Commission for spot Bitcoin ETF can be attributed to the almost 40% spike of BTC in just a month and around 125% increase in its value YTD. So far, the all-time high of the asset remains at $69,000. Note that while Europac’s Peter Schiff presents a sound forecast for Bitcoin, cryptocurrency markets can be highly unpredictable. Regulatory shifts or market sentiment changes may alter investments considerably, so one should exercise DD when making financial decisions anchored on opinions."
2023-11-11 14:38:01+00:00,The Bitcoin Price In Relation To Fear And Greed Index And Market Dominance,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-fear-and-greed-index-and-market-dominance/,"Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has experienced a price surge for a few weeks now, and it doesn’t show signs of stopping anytime soon. There have been many speculations, notably the news of the Bitcoin ETF being a major determining factor for the price surge. However, let’s closely examine the primary price determining factor: the choices and behavior of Bitcoin traders in relation to the Fear and Greed Index. Firstly, Bitcoin price dominance is a crucial aspect for investors and traders in the crypto market. Why is it important? It provides a comprehensive overview of market behavior and sentiments. Bitcoin Dominance is calculated as follows: BitcoinMarketCap÷TotalCryptoMarketCapitalizationBitcoinMarketCap÷TotalCryptoMarketCapitalization × 100 As of the time of publishing, Bitcoin’s market cap is $713,511,739,457, and the total market cap is $1,445,013,363,876. Bitcoin Dominance = (713,511,739,457 ÷ 1,445,013,363,876) × 100 = 49.38% This means that Bitcoin’s dominance currently sits at 49.38%. This figure is significant because it helps determine market sentiments, especially when considering Altcoins (other coins/tokens that are not Bitcoin). Read more about the current Bitcoin price here: Market Wrap: Bitcoin Exceeds $37,950 As Ethereum Breaks $2000, Is Bull Market Finally Back? Determining the Fear and Greed Index is not always perfectly accurate, as the factors involved include Bitcoin dominance, current market volatility, market volume, social media posts, surveys, Google trends, and others. These factors are assigned a certain weight, usually in percentage. All these factors contribute to how the Fear and Greed Index is calculated. The index considers the above features to create an indicator that shows whether the current market is in a Fear or Greed region. The indicator’s inputs vary, as different companies use different scales to represent their indicators. However, the one shown below is based on four categories: We are currently at 69, which indicates Greed. Just last week, we were at 68. The rising greed in the current market suggests that investors are looking to invest in Altcoins, hoping for substantial returns on their investments in a short period. Conversely, when in the Fear index, they tend to hold onto what they have and avoid perceived risks. During such times, investors are cautious, avoiding unnecessary risks and holding onto their assets. This could present an opportunity for others. Social media also contributes significantly, influencing some investors. Looking at the Bitcoin fear and greed chart, it is evident that various factors have influenced the trend from 2018 to date. Indeed, the Fear and Greed Index is directly influenced by the factors listed above, and certain news or events can sway market sentiment. For example, consider the extreme fear in April 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, and after the significant Bitcoin bull run in 2021, there was a drop followed by a steep decrease in Bitcoin price due to the Chinese ban on Bitcoin mining. The chart below displays the Fear and Greed Index in Bitcoin trading from 2018 to 2023. Don’t forget to Do Your Own Research (DYOR) and observe market sentiments. Look out for news and events that could induce extreme fear or extreme greed in the crypto market. Learn about Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA), hold onto coins/tokens with solid use cases and utility, and always check the Fear and Greed Index."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2023-11-10 15:47:53+00:00,BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF Plan Goes Public Following Nasdaq Filing,https://blockzeit.com/blackrock-ethereum-etf-plan-public-following-nasdaq-filing/,"BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, has made its first strides to create an Ethereum ETF, stirring a massive buzz around the cryptocurrency. Consequently, the price of ETH took an upward trajectory, adding 7% on Thursday and exceeding $2,000 – its highest gain since April, just before the filing was released.  The company’s ether ETF intention was disclosed in a filing by Nasdaq – which is the exchange where BlackRock intends to list the product, should it pass the regulatory approval.  It was gathered earlier on Thursday that BlackRock had registered the iShares Ethereum Trust as a statutory trust in the state of Delaware. Nasdaq also filed a proposal on that same day to list and trade the trust’s shares. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, wasn’t left behind as it went up 2.56%, hitting $36,553, thus floating around an 18-month high. The rise in the price of bitcoin could be attributed to the frequency at which asset managers began filing for ETF launches this summer. Earlier in June this year, BlackRock made the headlines for registering a similar bitcoin trust – and in a week, filing an application with the SEC to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. The Security and Exchange Commission, under Chair Gary Gensler, has still not approved any bitcoin ETF. The commission has been on a long-term opposition to any such fund, aside from some futures contract-backed ETFs. The SEC’s rejection of the spot ETFs has seen it block Grayscale’s application to convert its Bitcoin Trust to a spot ETF. One of the reasons for this objection was that the spot BTC market is susceptible to manipulation and fraud; although the SEC’s decision was later overruled by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals back in August. If the SEC eventually allows bitcoin ETFs to run, then ether funds should most likely follow suit since ether is the largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin. As per BlackRock’s filing for an ether ETF, Coinbase – a US-based crypto exchange – will have custody of the ether held by the product, while an unidentified third party will hold the cash. “The assets of the Trust consist primarily of ether held by a custodian on behalf of the Trust. Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC (the “Ether Custodian”), is the custodian for the Trust’s ether holdings; and another entity will be the custodian for the Trust’s cash holdings (the “Cash Custodian” and together with the Ether Custodian, the “Custodians”) and the administrator of the Trust (the “Trust Administrator”),” said the filing. In addition, BlackRock has secured a market-surveillance agreement with Coinbase, which should play a pivotal role in having such ETFs approved by the US Security Exchange Commission. There are currently about a dozen ETF providers filing to create spot bitcoin ETFs or convert their current products to spot ETFs in order to contribute towards the recent buzz around the cryptocurrency. Some other  ETF providers that have filed for spot bitcoin ETFs have also applied for SEC approval for spot ether funds, including Invesco, VanEck, Ark Investment Management, Gray-scale, and Hashdex."
2023-11-10 08:56:21+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Exceeds $37,950 As Ethereum Breaks $2000, Is Bull Market Finally Back?",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-exceeds-37950-as-ethereum-breaks-2000/,"Bitcoin price broke $37,000 and went as high as $37,973 in a burst move that saw it break free from a key resistance discussed here last week. It is the first time in 18 months that the asset has gone this high.  At the same time, Ethereum took the opportunity to go on a 17.5% rally and broke the $2,000 mark amidst rumours of an ETH ETF filing. A proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the iShares Ethereum Trust (the ""Trust"") under Nasdaq Rule 5711(d) (""Commodity-Based Trust Shares"").https://t.co/1UIucYnsb3 In the previous BTC price analysis, the asset was grappling with the $35,000 mark, trying to break above it, The bulls had put on much work, testing the resistance and facing rejection.  Due to this, our analysis pointed to a possible scenario where bulls would lose out on this tug, and the BTC price would retest $30,000.  However, amidst the impending approval of a spot BTC ETF approval, the asset shot up even higher, invalidating last week’s setup. After pumping 9.17% from last Friday, Bitcoin is looking to add even more gains – albeit not before a well-deserved breather. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages provide support for the asset at $35,388 and $32,543.  The market seems to be highly positive of Bitcoin Spot ETF approval, and the effect can be seen on BTC’s price. Bitcoin is now expected to retrace to $35,835 before rising higher.  Key resistance levels for BTC are $37,973 and $45,639. Unless bad news hits the crypto market, the coming week should be great for Bitcoin. In addition to Bitcoin’s rally, Ethereum rose massively on rumours that an ETH ETF filing by Blackrock was due. Next week will undoubtedly be an exciting week as the market holds its breath for either a reversal or a push higher for these assets. In the deep annals of crypto Twitter, rumours of a global financial overhaul are catching fire. This overhaul is connected to XRP, the SEC, and the banks and could affect the entire crypto and traditional financial market. November 9, 2023, was a key date for SEC v Ripple Settlement, but no news has come out yet. Other key dates in November include Nov. 16, 2023, Nov. 17, 2023, Nov. 18, 2023, Nov. 19, 2023, and Nov. 20, 2023.

2023-11-09 04:00:00+00:00,Why Bitcoin Is The Best Financial Instrument For Preserving Generational Wealth,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-generational-wealth-preservation/,"In the land of finance, a fresh tale is being written. It’s about an invincible hero – Bitcoin (BTC), that’s been capturing global attention with its power to preserve generational wealth. This digital stalwart shines as luxuriously as gold, yet surpasses it in numerous ways. For centuries, time-honored assets such as fine art or real estate have contributed to preserving family fortune across generations. However, today’s turning tides are steering towards uncharted territories where a new king rules – Bitcoin. Firstly, this crypto champion embodies scarcity just like gold but carries one-up over its golden rival: certitude in supply limit. The world doesn’t know the exact amount of potential gold reserves left unearthed; contrastingly with BTC there’s unwavering certainty that only 21 million units exist—period! As demand surges for this limited-supply asset and more people recognize bitcoin’s durability against inflationary pressures from Central Banks’ dovish policies globally—the price should theoretically climb upward on good old classic economics’ Supply-Demand principle leading well-structured portfolios toward whopping returns over long-term horizons. Then take mobility. Imagine transferring millions worth of luxury property cross-border—a logistic nightmare that the majority may concur. But what if we told you that the same value can be moved across nations instantaneously with Bitcoin? It is not only feasible but also incredibly straightforward, making BTC a truly global asset that can be taken anywhere hassle-free. An equally compelling feature of this hero asset is its resilience. Bitcoin has survived and thrived through countless market crashes since it first appeared in the fallout of the 2008 global financial crisis. This ‘digital phoenix’ continues to rise from the ashes time and again, demonstrating robust durability against economic downturns while gaining broader acceptance from institutional investors seeking low-correlation assets for diversification purposes. Moreover, let’s peek into future-proofing aspects. In an increasingly digital world where conventional physical investments seem somewhat archaic—BTC blends right like water. The younger generation’s vastly different approach towards wealth preservation embraces such modernities wholeheartedly—an evident hint at which direction generational fortunes might likely lean on soon. Although thinking about data privacy concerns around transaction records made public by Bitcoins’ transparent blockchain system pushes a legitimate worry, there are now ways to evade this nuance. Summing it up, the proposition enumerated here illustrates how Bitcoin transcends its perceived state as an instrument for investing and trading. The points laid here are unorthodox utilization of the intangible asset beyond a lifetime HODL that are worth considering."
2023-11-08 16:00:00+00:00,Why Day Traders Are Turning Away From Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/day-traders-are-turning-away-from-bitcoin/,"Between 2013 and 2017, investors like Peter To capitalized on the wild roller-coaster ride that was Bitcoin (BTC). As the cryptocurrency rose and fell dramatically during bull runs, he reportedly raked in over $1 million from day-trading activities. Now though, this New York-based professional stock trader sees less appeal with it. In To’s interview with Bloomberg, volatility—a key attraction for traders like him who are hunting market inefficiencies—has dwindled significantly. This reduced frenzy diminishes Bitcoin’s allure to such risk-taking investors. Former crypto day traders aren't coming back even as Bitcoin soars. ""The allure is kind of gone” https://t.co/0ndUvkaljj One significant shift shaking up the crypto landscape is its phase transition since chaotic scenes dominated exchanges like FTX just years ago. With the conviction of FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried reaching finalization, many proponents believe we’re entering a more mature era ripe for mainstream acceptance. This could signal tamer growth rates or fewer unique trading opportunities compared to yesteryear’s spectacular offers sparked by irrational exuberance around cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin had shown a recent spark spiking above $35k after slumping massively post-FTX-collapse last year. However, retail investors have retreated regardless following poor return trends for the digital asset that fell about 40% throughout 2022, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The situation is improving somewhat for crypto markets, with Bitstamp exchange witnessing an uptick in retail participation recently. But then again, the landscape has irrevocably altered as numerous day traders have already left and pivoted elsewhere. Craig Murray illustrates this exodus. Having barely saved his earnings from evaporating during FTX’s collapse, he was dejected by the risk associated and now avoids investing his money within such a volatile sector. Shifts in trading volumes on weekdays versus weekends suggest reduced retail activity compared to previous highs. Fredrick Collins of Velo Data notes how weekday volumes can often be 50% higher than weekend trades currently—a stark contrast against historical trends where it was nearly equal. Meanwhile, many others like Tim van den Berg bore hefty losses due to their involvement with highly unpredictable cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin over these years. The series of unlucky turns led them towards disenchantment around digital assets altogether amidst rampant market manipulation claims, too. Van den Berg delineates how decentralization ideals are seemingly replaced by big capital manipulations now. He claimed that this has deflated much enthusiasm from small investors like him who initially turned to cryptocurrencies hoping for a fairer financial system. Peter To harks back on days when market anomalies could be seized upon profitably, which is something not characteristic of the current crypto markets anymore. Nowadays, he says that if Bitcoin’s value increases, you’d win and vice versa; exhibiting a much more directional path unlike previous times when traders relied heavily on volatility instead. Craig Murray still does sporadic trading while focusing primarily on guiding newcomers through such digital asset trades. Yet, he advises caution due to rampant stories about quick fortunes misleading many into taking undue risks invariably leading to losses in most cases. This combined set of present circumstances has apparently led many day traders away from Bitcoin—signaling an altered perception around this major cryptocurrency within these cohorts as we progress further into this new chapter of mainstream adoption."
2023-11-06 14:00:00+00:00,4 Key Narratives That Will Pump The Price Of Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/narratives-that-will-pump-bitcoin/,"People in the crypto space are getting increasingly specific about what they are betting on for the next crypto bull cycle. And based on recent news and various reports, we have four key narratives that we are looking into for the future potential of Bitcoin. Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer has revisited his bullish Bitcoin thesis from 2020 and said Bitcoin is “exponential gold.” His thesis statement is simple. Bitcoin is a superior commodity currency that is on its way to becoming a store of value. It was Timmer who spoke back in 2021 about Bitcoin’s potential to follow gold’s parabolic rally in the 1970s. This would put Bitcoin at $1 billion per coin by 2038, according to Fidelity. It seems the bullish vibes from 2021 are returning.

Remember that crypto can be extremely volatile and narratives can wane just as quickly as they appear. Always do your own research and make sure you do not get blinded by the hype."

Despite this rejection, Bitcoin fundamentals have never been more robust as it has become one of the common topics of discussion on CNBC. Financial experts previously bearish on Bitcoin are now calling it a haven. Last week, Bitcoin experienced a massive push out of its consolidation zone after news of Bitcoin ETFs Getting Listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) broke. The asset hit $35,000, where it encountered resistance and would need to break it to go to the $45,000 level. Over the past week, Bitcoin tried to break this barrier but has remained unsuccessful on multiple tries. However, on Wednesday, November 1, 2023, BTC exceeded $35,000 and nearly hit $36,000.  On the 4-hour chart. The 50-day moving average has provided steady support for Bitcoin on the 4-hour timeframe at $34,000, while the 200-day moving average prompts the asset to retest the breakout zone at $30,778. Despite the support provided by these indicators, the rejection BTC is facing at the $35,000 – $36,000 level is cause for concern. Such kind of rejection indicates the Bears evenly competing with the Bulls.  It also shows the reducing bullish power and the increasing bearish power. What may follow is a full-on retest to the $30,000 area, and if the resistance-turned-support at the $30k does not hold, the trend can quickly become bearish. Key support levels for Bitcoin lie at $33,190, $31,247, and $27,959, while key resistance levels are $36,478, $38,420 and $41,708"
2023-11-02 08:00:00+00:00,TradFi Is Now Taking Over The Bitcoin Revolution,https://blockzeit.com/tradfi-is-now-taking-over-the-bitcoin-revolution/,"The Bitcoin white paper couldn’t have come at a more opportune time than at the end of October 2008. During that time, the world was struggling with the Global Financial Crisis and many people have lost their trust in the traditional model of finance. The document made by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto presented a way out of the norm with its decentralized design, but fast-forward today, it seems that traditional finance (TradFi) is slowly encroaching on the crypto space by fusing blockchain and cryptocurrencies in its products and services. Despite the revolutionary nature of the Bitcoin blockchain’s design, there was no express mention in its white paper that it’s meant to replace traditional banking and fiat currency. Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision for it was initially to present people with an alternative, not a replacement. However, as more people started seeing the value of Bitcoin and have unlocked more use cases for it, the narrative that it can remodel the financial world and provide a way out of central bank or government control has caught on. This has also resulted in the influx of other tokens that are decentralized in nature. Soon after, Wall Street and traditional finance, often referred to as TradFi, started to take notice of this emerging financial frontier. They aimed to migrate traditional financial operations onto blockchain technology while embracing the concept of “digital assets” – their euphemism for cryptocurrencies. The allure of decentralization and bypassing intermediaries drew idealists and, inevitably, a few opportunists into the world of cryptocurrencies. Today, we find ourselves in an intriguing paradox. The very institutions that cryptocurrencies aimed to replace are now driving the space, notably in the mainstream. A few examples of TradFi institutions that are now capitalizing on the crypto bandwagon are Blackrock, Fidelity, and Grayscale through Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETF). Although their applications for the new financial instrument are still pending in the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the positive sentiment towards their approval is already pushing up the prices of Bitcoin and other mainstream cryptos. Their eventual approval from the regulator will undoubtedly usher in a wave of institutional investments into Bitcoin, potentially reshaping the crypto landscape. In another twist, even the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, which traces its roots all the way back to the 19th-century commodity markets, is now reportedly on its way to surpassing Binance in terms of the number of crypto derivatives exchanged worldwide. To put this into perspective, Binance holds 28% of all futures open interest while CME accounts for 26%. When it comes to open futures contracts in Bitcoin, the crypto exchange led by Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has 113,419 BTC compared to CME’s 103,075 BTC. This increasing presence of TradFi in the cryptocurrency market poses intriguing questions about the future of digital currencies. While Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominates the crypto space, it’s vital to remember that cryptocurrencies encompass a vast ecosystem. Blockchains like Ethereum and associated layer-2 networks, such as Polygon, offer diverse applications beyond financial services. As we navigate this evolving landscape, we must recognize the irony of traditional finance giants playing a pivotal role in a realm initially designed to challenge their dominance. However, the extent of their influence in the crypto space largely hinges on regulatory decisions, with regulatory bodies displaying some hesitance. In the end, Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision was to create a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust. The cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, and traditional financial players have begun making their mark. Whether crypto enthusiasts will continue to trust these newfound shepherds or follow the original vision of decentralization remains a question yet to be answered."
2023-11-01 14:27:24+00:00,"Bitcoin mining, you must be mad!",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-mining-you-must-be-mad/,"When I read the incredible stories in ‘The Prize’ about the early wildcatters in America prospecting for oil, the irrepressible frenzies, the heights of elation and the depths of despair were palpable to me because I am participating in the modern day equivalent; the crazy world of Bitcoin mining. What’s it like to be a small wildcatter? The fact you are reading this means you think Bitcoin is a real deal, otherwise you would be reading Barron’s, the WSJ, or the FT, so let me tell you a story. Let’s get something clear from the start. I am a Warren Buffett disciple, a believer in business ownership, cash flows and competent management with skin in the game going for consistent growth. I never liked gold, or commodity ownership and had no idea how you would start valuing a work of art. So how did I end up Bitcoin mining? It started when I heard a lecture on blockchain and Bitcoin and was intrigued about a system outside of the obviously corrupt fiat systems that we currently are forced to accept and use. Not blaming individuals, but our political systems are poorly designed. The best examples I can see are Switzerland (look at the strength of the Swiss Franc and give me another explanation other than its federal canton and referendum system), or maybe the positive non interventionism in Hong Kong, now thoroughly degraded Chinese style. Once I realised Bitcoin was real, and the security of the network was properly engineered, my conclusion was that the ‘Governments’, of all countries whose politicians want to maintain their power, would ban Bitcoin. It was too good, they would have to ban it. But they didn’t, they dithered, they sniped, they moaned, but they didn’t know how to stop it, and now it’s just too late. The horse has bolted, fast and strong, across open land, never to be caught. A friendly neighbour of mine mentioned a big Bitcoin mining company in America and I looked at the maths. My base case was Bitcoin would rally after the Covid slump and the numbers were pretty simple. You buy some machines, depreciate them over three years (more of this later), and then pay for power each month. The net result was that with .007 BTC per Peta Hash you could quickly calculate what profit was possible. So I had about 7 Peta Hash and that meant some $1000 per day of revenue in BTC and power costs of some $500. What could possibly go wrong, I thought? Why doesn’t everyone do this? At this point I was Blackadder and Baldrick in one body: Moronic and cunning, a dangerous combination. It turned out lots could go wrong, including: But I am lucky, and my guess about BTC’s price was on the money. I decided to depreciate the machines I purchased over one year, on the basis that it was a ‘conservative’ way to counter the huge BTC price swings and the probable hashrate rise. In doing so I was barely profitable, but it allowed me to buy more to counter the hahsrate rise. I won’t use the word invest because buying a computer doesn’t meet Ben Graham’s definition of investing, however you stretch it. But, oh my, the hashrate just powered upwards. The hashrate rise is unreal. Remember this is a low, low, barrier to entry business. A fool like me can start mining, anyone with enough ability to open Google sheets and a willingness to limit their risk outlook to just the next six to twelve months can get in the game. The hashrate now means that the same 7 peta hash I started with yields about a third of what it did, resulting in a drop of a half in yield, even though the price of BTC is up about 75% and the energy costs have more than doubled. It’s not pretty. Put that into some perspective. Imagine starting farming, growing your crop and after a few years receiving half of what you were originally making even though the crops you are producing are getting towards twice as valuable. Oh and did I mention the fixed costs have gone up, not down? It’s a bit like starting a long motorcycle trip, the weather looks okay, not great, but good enough. You start out, the weather worsens, fingers get cold, then it starts to rain, and you get water dripping into your underwear and your feet are soggy. Then it gets really cold and it properly chucks it down, so you think about sheltering under a bridge, but there aren’t any, so you twist the wrist and concentrate, freezing, it’s deeply unpleasant. Have you been there? You know what I’m talking about if you have. There is no respite, well except when that lovely Chinese government closed down Bitcoin mining in China and made all of us outside China very happy for a month or two: Thanks Xi Dada, I love you for that alone, everything else.. err not so much. Now, let’s return to equipment depreciation. I have bought new machines, used machines from China, from Canada, from the USA, and every transaction is scary. Will they arrive, will they work, did I pay too much, is the next generation going to make them worthless? These are the questions that often are unanswered when a miner buys equipment. And the really weird thing about this is that the machines are not priced against their manufacturing cost, but against the current hashrate price. So you are forced to massively overpay in a bull market top, or wait until the market is dead (and might stay dead) to buy at a reasonable price. There is no winning here, there is only fear and doubt. Of course many American mining companies have gone bust, it’s very easy to do this. Imagine the market is good. Mining is profitable. The only rational course of action is to lever up and mine as much as possible, as fast as possible, to do anything else other than this would be irrational given Bitcoin’s fixed supply and endless competition. But suddenly the market collapses, the energy costs soar and all that money you borrowed to get more machines online cannot be paid back. It’s a quick trip to the poor house. Do not pass GO. It’s like Florida property speculation on steroids. So far I have seen market ups and downs, the hashrate relentlessly climb, the power costs soar and subside, the equipment prices climb and crash, the equipment efficiencies double, and more and more people and companies climb into the ring to fight for the ever dwindling ten minute block rewards and fees due to the lucky miner able to complete the nonce for that block. What a crazy business, all built on a software protocol that according to the wonderful Mr Peter Schiff has almost zero value, or is ‘rat poison’ according to the erudite Charlie Munger. My counter to the ‘Bitcoin has no intrinsic value’ cry is usually ‘Hey, if someone can pay $100m plus for some pictures of multi coloured soup cans that cost some $100 to make, then why can’t Bitcoin be worth something’ Like art and gold the value is in the global acceptance, the perception and the rarity. Does it make sense, no, almost certainly not. But for me it doesn’t need to. I can no more explain art and Bitcoin valuations than my dog can calculate the force of gravity, but he knows how to jump and land safely when he needs to. It’s an animal spirit, free market thing and right now it is running free. If you enjoyed this article, you might also like to read: Bitcoin and Political Improvement"
2023-11-01 08:00:00+00:00,Bitcoin May Be On Its Way To A Gamma Squeeze,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-gamma-squeeze/,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) recently spiked up to $35K because of the anticipation for the approval of Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETF) in the US. Analysts predict that further increases may be coming up, and getting to certain levels in the near future could eventually force another short squeeze. On October 24, Bitcoin hit a milestone for the year as its price surged by 15% all the way to $35,000. The ascend of the cryptocurrency coincided with the listing of Blackrock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBTC) on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) website, a company responsible for clearing NASDAQ trades, which helped build confidence that the US Securities and Exchange Commission may be on its way to approving it. Alex Thorn, the head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital, believes that the climb of the digital asset is far from over. In his post on X (formerly Twitter), the analyst said that another gamma squeeze may be on its way for the pioneering cryptocurrency. According to the Galaxy exec, if the digital currency’s price moves up to the $35,750 to $36,000 range, options dealers will have to buy $20 million more in spot Bitcoin for every 1% increase in its value. the #bitcoin gamma squeeze from last week could happen again 👀if BTCUSD moves higher to $35,750-36k, options dealers will need to buy $20m in spot BTC for every 1% upside move, which could cause explosiveness if we begin to move up towards those levelsmore 👇 pic.twitter.com/OA9tJ0ZaK9 Thorn’s analysis also delves into on-chain data, revealing a widening gap between BTC supply held by long-term holders and that which has moved within the last 24 hours, signaling a decline in on-chain liquidity. Additionally, the 4-year rolling Z-score, a measure of market price to realized price, indicates that Bitcoin remains structurally sound and not overvalued. He also highlights that 87% of Bitcoin supply has remained untouched since lower price levels, observing a sparse cost basis between the present price and the $38,400 to $39,100 levels. The analyst didn’t provide the near term price for Bitcoin but he sees a bullish narrative further building up hype for it. As of this writing at 6:00 AM (UTC time) Bitcoin is trading around $34,364 showing only a 0.13% gain in the past 24 hours with trading volume down by 7.72% over the same period based on CoinMarketCap data. During the same timeframe, the digital asset saw a low of $34,083 and a high of $34,719. Based on 10-year historical data, Bitcoin’s all-time high came in on November 10 two years ago at $68,789 while its all-time low came in on July 06 2013 at $65.53."
2023-10-31 04:00:00+00:00,VanEck Refiles A Spot Bitcoin ETF Application With The SEC,https://blockzeit.com/vaneck-refiles-a-spot-bitcoin-etf/,"Asset management firm VanEck has filed for what they are calling an amended application for a spot Bitcoin Exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The filing, as reported by the regulator’s database, is now joining the bandwagon of updates by other ETFs. Its competitors, including BlackRock, recently made a similar move. NEW: VanEck has refiled a spot #Bitcoin ETF application with the 🇺🇸 SEC 👀This reaffirms its dedication to providing a regulated #Bitcoin investment avenue for both retail and institutional investors, amid rising competition from firms like BlackRock pic.twitter.com/4OLHP6hF2a Many firms are eyeing a Bitcoin ETF as it gives them a way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of directly purchasing. This makes it more accessible to a broader range of investors, both retail and institutional. Therefore, the spot version of the cryptocurrency is expected to draw substantial investments from investors seeking Bitcoin exposure through traditional asset managers. VanEck initially filed for a Bitcoin ETF with the U.S. SEC several years ago. However, the early attempts faced regulatory hurdles and were eventually withdrawn. The company’s updated filing, however, reflects its commitment to providing a Bitcoin ETF that adheres to the strict regulatory standards of traditional financial markets. With the new filing, VanEck joins a growing list of asset managers updating their applications for a Bitcoin ETF. Last month, Bitwise Asset Management filed a similar application in response to the SEC’s objections to the product. The main concern by the SEC has been potential market manipulation and investor protection in the market, playing a role in previous ETF application rejections. Early this month, ARK Invest and 21Shares amended their joint application, adding information including practices for asset custody and valuation. The rate at which amended fillings flow may indicate that negotiations between asset managers and regulators are progressing. The U.S. SEC has delayed its decision on several proposals for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the country. These rejections include BlackRock, Invesco, Bitwise, VanEck, and Valkyrie. However, market participants and analysts predict that a decision should be made within weeks. "
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."

The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."

He predicted that the rising tensions in the region and the continuous involvement of the US in the event could trigger “global wartime inflation,” which could push the value of Bitcoin up to $1 million. In his blog post on the Crypto Traders Digest, Arthur Hayes commented that wars are costly and have the tendency to increase government borrowing. The crypto investor noted that the prospect of increased government borrowing on the horizon could result in a major upheaval in the financial realm. Hayes explained that the resulting “global wartime inflation” because of the involvement of the US in the Middle East conflict could ultimately cause US Treasury bonds to lose the kind of security they offer to investors. This shift could drive them to seek alternative assets like gold. He said that investors will likely turn to Bitcoin, too, due to the cryptocurrency’s perceived effectiveness as a hedge against geopolitical and financial uncertainty. The BitMex co-founder doesn’t stop at merely discussing the potential for inflation; he goes on to predict a remarkable surge in Bitcoin’s price. He suggested in his post on X (formerly Twitter) that the ongoing climate of financial uncertainty could push Bitcoin’s price to climb to $1 million. The bond vigilantes are yelling “down with the dollar.” Look out for my spicy essay “The Periphery” dropping this week where I discuss the Hamas vs. Israel war, the US Treasury market, and $BTC. YCC = $1mm $BTC is in full effect. Yachtzee!!! pic.twitter.com/1ABcW1esaf Recent events in the $25 trillion US government bond market have added weight to Hayes’ concerns. For the first time in 16 years, the bond prices on 10-year US Treasury notes have spiked by 5% according to Forbes. In addition to the shakeup in the bond market, central banks worldwide are now contending with soaring inflation. The unprecedented money printing and supply shocks unleashed during the COVID-19 pandemic have had profound effects on economies globally. In response, central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, have been forced to raise interest rates in an attempt to quell runaway inflation. However, these measures have not been without consequences, as they’ve contributed to volatility in Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and traditional stock markets over the past two years. Furthermore, Hayes alluded to a potential end game in which the Federal Reserve may finally be exposed in its role of manipulating the interest rates of the US Treasury market. This would effectively dispel any pretense of a free market and could spell a bull market in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In light of the looming uncertainty in traditional financial markets and the potential for “global wartime inflation,” Hayes advises investors to consider reallocating their investments. With that, he recommended that investors should stay away from US Treasury bills and shift to cryptocurrencies instead. As the world watches for developments in these tumultuous times, the crypto market remains on high alert. Bitcoin’s potential to reach $1 million, as forecasted by Arthur Hayes, hinges on the unfolding geopolitical and economic events. Investors are now left to ponder the wisdom of diversifying their portfolios into assets that may prove more resilient in the face of a turbulent future."
2023-10-30 06:00:00+00:00,Crypto Analyst Foresees Bitcoin Surge Following Resistance Break,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-surge-following-resistance-break-seen/,"An influential figure in the cryptocurrency scene going by the alias “The Flow Horse” is making noise in social media with a bullish prediction regarding Bitcoin (BTC). The anonymous trader, who boasts a cult following of 183,000 on the X platform (formerly Twitter), believes that the digital asset’s recent rally is far from over. The Flow Horse’s outlook is predicated on a longer-term perspective of Bitcoin’s price action. He contends that the world’s leading digital currency still has room to ascend by approximately 25%, even after surpassing a critical resistance level. According to the crypto trader and influencer, the clean breakout above the $32,000 threshold signals a potential upward trajectory for Bitcoin. From a wider perspective, he envisions the cryptocurrency hitting at least $39,000 in the near future. When I zoom out I have a hard time not seeing Bitcoin hitting at least 39k in the short term. We broke out of a multi-quarter range, and have put plenty of people in a position of discomfort, wondering if they should chase or not. It would be a rare occasion for this to not… pic.twitter.com/WLCh6ihI5S This development is seen as a significant shift, as it heralds the end of a multi-quarter consolidation range, leaving many investors in a state of uncertainty, contemplating whether they should join the rally. The Flow Horse acknowledges that there is a potential stumbling block that could derail the crypto market’s strength: external influences from the traditional financial sector. Nevertheless, he points out that equity markets have already experienced considerable corrections, which have had minimal impact on the cryptocurrency realm. My only concern for crypto is if legacy does something wonky, and right now although we are well off the highs, almost no fear gauges are flashing. The pseudonymous trader’s concern remains relatively muted as no significant signs of fear are emanating from traditional markets. As of this writing, Bitcoin is hovering around the $34,400 line. The numbers are slightly up by 0.80% on a 24-hour frame, and down from the prices it displayed in some exchanges that crossed the $35,100 threshold. The recent rally of the cryptocurrency was primarily triggered by the listing of the Blackrock spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF), iShares Bitcoin Trust ($IBTC), at the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC). The listing helped further build hype for the highly-anticipated Bitcoin ETF in the US. However, $IBTC suddenly disappeared from the DTCC listing following a crash on its website. This sunk the price of Bitcoin down by 4.62%, which it quickly recovered when it was once again displayed on the list together with the 21Shares spot Bitcoin exchange traded product (ETP) of Ark Invest. Speaking of Ark Invest, the company’s CEO, Cathie Wood recently made a bold new prediction about Bitcoin. The firm’s boss said that there’s substantial growth in the digital asset. Their latest assessment sees the cryptocurrency rising to $680,000 by the end of this decade. One key reason cited by Wood for this bullish forecast was Bitcoin’s supply, which makes it a good hedge. The limited supply of 21 million coins combined with continuously rising demand has the potential to make its value appreciate over time. The cryptocurrency community eagerly watches as The Flow Horse’s predictions unfold in the midst of Bitcoin’s intriguing journey. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood’s ambitious forecast for Bitcoin’s future value reinforces the notion that the digital asset continues to be a focal point of interest in the financial world."
2023-10-27 14:00:00+00:00,"Bitcoin At $34,000 Is Likely The Best Purchase You Could Ever Make Right Now",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-best-purchase/,"Talks about the looming approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) in the US are pushing the pioneering cryptocurrency to levels last seen in May 2022. Although there appears to be resistance for BTC within the $36,000 mark, purchasing a unit or units of it at $34,000 might prove to be the best investment decision you could ever make right now. Cathie Wood, the influential figure behind Ark Invest, and her team have once again demonstrated their immense confidence in Bitcoin. Their investment strategy, centered around disruptive and innovative companies, aligns perfectly with Bitcoin’s potential. Wood and her colleagues believe that Bitcoin has room for substantial growth and could reach a staggering $680,000 by 2030. The prediction reported by The Motley Fool may sound overly optimistic, but it’s one that carries weight when analyzed in current market conditions. The analysts foresee not only individual investors but also central banks, institutional investors, and corporations including Bitcoin in their portfolios. The digital asset’s utility as a currency in emerging economies and as a remittance tool further supports this bullish perspective. One key attribute that makes Bitcoin an enticing investment is its fixed supply cap. With only 21 million coins ever to be in existence, this limited supply presents a compelling case for ownership. In a scenario where demand rises and supply remains constant, the price should naturally appreciate. Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against government financial instability is also evident, given the mounting debt troubles and political turmoil facing nations like the United States. The US alone carries a $33.7 trillion debt burden, which doesn’t even encompass underfunded liabilities like Social Security and Medicare. Historically, this debt has grown alongside money printing and inflation. As illustrated by El Salvador, Bitcoin offers an alternative to government-backed money. With its decentralized and borderless nature, it could serve as an insurance policy against a potential financial system collapse. This is probably one of the reasons why the US government continues to hold its $5 billion stash. While the long-term potential of Bitcoin is promising, the short-term fluctuations can be daunting for some investors. It is wise to start with a small position in your portfolio and increase it as your understanding of Bitcoin deepens. Investing with a long-term mindset is key, as the cryptocurrency market can be volatile. By doing so, one can gradually navigate the potential rewards while mitigating risks. It’s essential to acknowledge that the cryptocurrency market carries inherent risks. The journey from obscurity to legitimacy is not without obstacles, and regulatory changes or unforeseen events could impact Bitcoin’s trajectory. Diversifying one’s investment portfolio is a prudent strategy to minimize risk within this context. Bitcoin at $34,000 presents an interesting investment opportunity. While the figures cited from Ark Invest may seem optimistic, they underscore the digital currency’s potential. Its limited supply, utility, and the current state of traditional financial systems all contribute to its allure. As always, potential investors should approach with caution, keeping in mind the risks that come with the rewards in the volatile cryptocurrency market. It’s essential to conduct your research and consult with financial advisors before making any investment decisions."
2023-10-27 06:23:35+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Eyes $45,000 As Bulls Prepare To Re-Engage",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-eyes-45000/,"Bitcoin price experienced a staggering 16% rally this week following news hinting at a possible Bitcoin ETF approval by Blackrock. Last week, Bitcoin jumped slightly on the news of Ripple executives walking free from their lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC).  The RSI was already overbought, but a last-minute update to the Blackrock-SEC Bitcoin ETF struggle indicated some volatility in the coming week. BlackRock had filed an updated spot Bitcoin ETF application after SEC feedback last Friday. The price successfully broke out of the previous consolidation zone, pushing higher. On some exchanges, BTC hit $35,100 as bulls went all in.  Key support levels for Bitcoin now lie at $33,649, $32,109, and $20,569. The 200-day and 50-day moving averages also provide lower support for Bitcoin at $27,577 and $29,029 respectively. Moving forward, Bitcoin is expected to retest the strong resistance-turned-support level at $32,109 before bouncing off to try and reclaim $45,000. It is worth noting that there is a local resistance around the $36,000 level that BTC must first overcome. More positive news about the ETF could serve as the propelling force Bitcoin needs to pull another rally successfully and hit $45,000. On October 23, 2023, Eric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, reported that  BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF had been listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) – which handles NASDAQ trades.  BTC’s price went insane after that report and posted 14.89% gains over the next 24 hours. Furthermore, public Bitcoin ETF funds received a remarkable $43 million inflow, equivalent to 10% of the year-to-date total – all within a single day! Following the DTCC website crash on Tuesday, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust disappeared from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, where it had been listed the previous day, causing BTC price to decline sharply by 4.62%.  However, the ETF ($IBTC) was re-listed on Wednesday, and BTC quickly regained the lost profits. Finally, on October 25, 2023, Ark spot Bitcoin ETF was also listed on the DTCC. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has eight to 10 filings of possible Bitcoin ETFs in front of it for consideration, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said Thursday, October 26, 2023. Crypto enthusiasts speculate that the SEC is getting ready to approve all ETFs simultaneously, but only time will tell.

2023-10-27 04:00:00+00:00,The Transformational Impact Of Bitcoin On Developing Economies,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-in-developing-economies/,"In recent years, Bitcoin (BTC) has emerged as a game-changer for developing economies, offering a beacon of hope for those seeking financial empowerment. Its decentralized and borderless nature has the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems, making it a powerful tool for fostering financial inclusion and growth. In this article, we will explore how Bitcoin is reshaping the fortunes of developing countries, leveraging the insights of Ricardo Salinas, a visionary advocate for economic empowerment. In a global landscape where conventional financial services are still inaccessible to a huge part of the populace or are subject to limitations, Bitcoin serves as a pillar of hope. This decentralized digital currency effortlessly surpasses geographical boundaries, affording people the ability to send and receive funds directly, free from reliance on intermediaries such as traditional banks or payment processors. In emerging economies where a significant portion of the population lacks access to full-fledged banking services—leaving them without fundamental financial tools such as bank accounts and loans—the digital asset plays a pivotal role in addressing this disparity. This grants individuals the means to establish digital wallets and engage in secure transactions. This newfound financial autonomy opens up doors to saving, investing, and pursuing entrepreneurial endeavors even for the unbanked. Bitcoin’s transformative potential lies in its ability to challenge the existing economic order. By offering an alternative to traditional banking and monetary systems, Bitcoin paves the way for financial inclusion and stability, especially in developing countries where large segments of the population are excluded from formal financial systems. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has the potential to significantly reduce transaction costs and enhance efficiency in cross-border remittances, especially when fused with the power of the Lightning Network. Sending money across borders is often an expensive and time-consuming process, laden with exorbitant fees and lengthy processing times. Bitcoin’s decentralized architecture enables swifter and more cost-effective cross-border transactions, making it an attractive option for remittances, which are a lifeline for many families in developing nations. Ricardo Salinas, a prominent advocate for economic empowerment, sees Bitcoin as a powerful instrument for uplifting developing economies. His interest in Bitcoin was sparked by curiosity about the emerging technology, but he soon recognized its profound potential to reshape the fate of developing nations. The analyst firmly believes that Bitcoin’s ability to circumvent traditional financial institutions aligns seamlessly with his vision for economic empowerment. Salinas has been actively campaigning for Bitcoin’s adoption in developing economies. He envisions a world where individuals take control of their financial destinies, breaking free from the shackles of conventional banking systems. His message to people in these regions is simple: embrace Bitcoin to gain access to global financial markets and partake in the digital economy. While the potential of Bitcoin in developing nations is evident, there are challenges to address. One of the primary obstacles is the lack of technical infrastructure and reliable Internet connectivity. To access and utilize Bitcoin, individuals require a dependable internet connection and access to the necessary technology. Governments and organizations must invest in improving digital infrastructure to ensure widespread adoption. But then again, it should be noted that an African developer has found a way around this obstacle through the development of an SMS-based Bitcoin trading platform called Machankura. This effort is worth emulating for areas with poor Internet connectivity. The future of Bitcoin in developing nations holds great promise. However, it’s not a path without its hurdles. The development of regulatory frameworks is essential to ensure consumer protection and prevent illicit activities. Moreover, education and awareness campaigns are crucial to enable individuals to grasp the potential of Bitcoin fully. At the crossroads of Bitcoin and developing nations lies an immense opportunity for economic empowerment. Ricardo Salinas’ vision for Bitcoin’s future is one of inclusive financial systems and equal opportunities for all. By harnessing the transformational potential of Bitcoin, developing nations can leapfrog traditional financial systems and establish a more equitable economic playing field. In conclusion, Bitcoin is poised to reshape the destiny of developing countries. Its role in financial inclusion and empowerment is a topic of profound significance, as echoed by the visionary Ricardo Salinas. By embracing Bitcoin, developing nations are presented with a unique opportunity to overcome economic barriers and foster inclusive growth. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, Bitcoin adoption promises a brighter future for all. 🇲🇽 Billionaire Ricardo Salinas: “Sell bonds, buy #Bitcoin.”The Full Bitcoin Magazine Interview: pic.twitter.com/AU8qXCHhuj"
2023-10-26 04:00:00+00:00,Bitcoin ATM Scams In The US Are On The Rise,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-atm-scams/,"In recent years, scammers have honed their craft to exploit Bitcoin ATMs, preying on unsuspecting victims. These fraudulent schemes are on the rise, with devastating consequences for those who fall victim to them. Scammers exploit Bitcoin ATMs. Will new California laws help crack down on fraud? https://t.co/7f1hkdZNTX This article explores the alarming trend of Bitcoin ATM scams and provides practical tips on how to safeguard yourself from falling into their traps. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts widely value the convenience and accessibility offered by Bitcoin ATMs. These machines can be found in various business establishments, such as convenience stores and gas stations, providing a quick and straightforward means of acquiring digital assets using physical cash. Unfortunately, the very convenience that attracts legitimate users has also piqued the interest of unscrupulous players, who have masterminded intricate schemes to separate unsuspecting victims from their hard-earned money. As documented in a report by the Los Angeles Times, these fraudsters are increasingly exploiting Bitcoin ATMs to perpetrate financial fraud. One such example was the incident that transpired involving a California resident named Jim Meduri. He claimed to have received a distressing phone call from an individual posing as his son, who relayed a fabricated story of a car accident complete with a convincingly tearful voice. According to the elaborate ruse, Meduri’s son had purportedly been apprehended due to a DUI-related accident involving a pregnant woman and her child. Further complicating matters, individuals feigned being associated with the courtroom and one assumed the role of an attorney. The orchestrated deception ultimately compelled Meduri to dispatch $15,000 in cash through a Bitcoin ATM, only for him to realize the extent of the deception after the fact. In response to the growing threat of Bitcoin ATM scams, government officials, regulatory bodies, and organizations advocating for consumer rights have intensified their efforts to safeguard the public. Notably, California has taken decisive action by implementing restrictions on cryptocurrency ATM transactions, limiting them to a maximum of $1,000 per day per individual. This measure, established through Senate Bill 401 and endorsed by Governor Gavin Newsom, is designed to offer potential targets more time to discern fraudulent activities and prevent substantial cash transfers into the realm of cryptocurrency. Commencing in the year 2025, this fresh legislation will also introduce a ceiling on fees associated with these transactions, stipulating that fees cannot exceed either $5 or 15% of the transaction amount, depending on which of the two is the greater figure. This regulatory adjustment is intended to address the prevailing issue of exorbitant charges linked to cryptocurrency ATM operations. According to the insights provided by legislative analysis, these machines commonly impose fees ranging between 12% and 25% above the intrinsic value of the digital asset. While the need to protect consumers from fraud is evident, lawmakers in California and other states must also consider the impact of stricter regulation on the cryptocurrency industry. The delicate balance between nurturing responsible innovation and safeguarding consumers’ interests presents a challenge for legislators. To address this concern, California is working on another law that would require digital financial asset businesses to obtain a license from the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation by July 2025. The goal is to provide clarity to consumers and regulators regarding the industry’s operations. Governor Newsom recognizes the need to strike a balance between consumer protection and encouraging responsible innovation. This commitment to finding equilibrium is essential as the cryptocurrency industry continues to evolve. While legislative measures are essential to combating Bitcoin ATM scams, individuals should also take precautions to avoid falling victim to these schemes. Here are some practical steps to protect yourself: Scammers often create a false sense of urgency to manipulate victims. If someone claims you need to make a quick transaction, take a step back and verify the situation independently. Call your loved ones or relevant authorities to confirm the details before proceeding. Never share personal or financial information with anyone over the phone or online without verifying their identity. Be cautious of unsolicited calls and messages. Before using a Bitcoin ATM, research the operator and ensure they are registered with the appropriate authorities. This can help you determine the legitimacy of the machine and the likelihood of encountering scams. If you intend to conduct a significant cryptocurrency transaction, be prepared to provide additional identification and ensure you are dealing with a reputable operator. Bitcoin ATM scams are a growing concern that can result in devastating financial losses. While legislative efforts aim to mitigate these risks, individuals must also take proactive steps to protect themselves from falling prey to these schemes. By exercising caution, verifying information, and being informed about cryptocurrency transactions, you can reduce the likelihood of becoming a victim of these scams."

2023-10-24 10:00:00+00:00,BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF Progress Signals Optimism In The Crypto Market,https://blockzeit.com/blackrock-ishares-bitcoin-etf/,"In recent developments, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with $10 trillion in assets under management, has taken significant steps toward the creation of a proposed iShares Bitcoin Trust, signaling the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This progress has caught the attention of crypto market observers who are increasingly optimistic about the prospects of ETFs in the cryptocurrency space. One of the most noteworthy developments is the listing of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) website.  NEW – BlackRock's iShares #Bitcoin Trust is now listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation with the ticker $IBTC pic.twitter.com/kV8zxzJrEv This listing includes the ETF’s ticker symbol “IBTC”, which is significant as it represents the first proposed spot Bitcoin ETF listed on DTCC, a financial market infrastructure giant processing trillions of dollars in securities transactions daily. The National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC), a DTCC subsidiary, is equipped to review the ETF’s portfolio constituents, automate the creation and redemption of ETF shares, and manage settlement processes. The listing suggests a significant stride in bringing a crypto ETF to the market, setting the stage for potential regulatory approval. Read: Plot Twist: BlackRock CEO Endorses Bitcoin Eric Balchunas, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, highlights BlackRock’s proactive approach in dealing with the logistics of launching a Bitcoin ETF, such as seeding, choosing the ticker symbol, and engaging with DTCC. Background: Seeding an ETF is when initial funding is provided (typically) by a bank or broker dealer used to purchase a few creation units (in this case bitcoin) in exchange for ETF shares which can be traded in open market on Day One. BlackRock’s recent amendment to its Bitcoin ETF proposal on October 18 included the addition of a CUSIP, a unique identifier for North American securities, essential for clearing and settlement processes. The filing also hinted at the purchase of seed creation baskets in October, albeit subject to certain conditions, emphasizing the preparation that typically occurs just before the ETF’s launch.

Nothing new, just the formal mandate statement. 👇🏼 pic.twitter.com/UzdEir2nqg Additionally, legal developments have also played a role in advancing the case for crypto ETFs—the DC Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed its earlier ruling, stating that the SEC’s decision to reject the conversion of GBTC into an ETF while approving Bitcoin futures funds was “arbitrary and capricious.” Read: Grayscale CEO Believes Bitcoin ETF Approval Is In sight If BlackRock’s iShares application is approved, it could open the floodgates for other spot crypto ETF filings currently under review by the SEC. The regulatory agency’s approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF is a significant milestone for the crypto industry and is seen as a step towards mainstream acceptance and investment in digital assets. In conclusion, the listing of BlackRock’s proposed ETF on the DTCC website, coupled with proactive steps and amendments to various ETF applications, indicates a growing sense of optimism in the cryptocurrency market. The pursuit of a Bitcoin ETF is gaining momentum, and regulatory approval could have a profound impact on the industry, making digital assets more accessible to a broader range of investors. While challenges and uncertainties remain, the progress made thus far signals a positive outlook for the future of crypto ETFs."
2023-10-24 04:00:00+00:00,"The Bitcoin Bulls Are On The Move, Here’s Why",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-bulls-are-on-the-move/,"The bulls seem to be stampeding in Bitcoin (BTC). Is this a sign that the crypto winter is over? As of this writing at 2:15 AM UTC time, Bitcoin is trading around $34,418 showing a whopping 24-hour rise equivalent to 14.14% with a trading volume of $41.52 billion. The market cap of the digital asset is currently around $671.35 billion with a circulating supply of 19.52 million. The day’s range saw the cryptocurrency swing between $32K to $35K mark and it’s now on its 52-week peak from the base of $15,599.05. From the looks of it, it continues to move on an upward trend. Analysts are currently attributing the upward swing to the anticipation of the impending launch of a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Market data shows that there is an uptick in weekly crypto asset inflows triggered by institutional investors who are going bullish for BTC. Lately, there has been a surge in positive sentiment regarding the potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. This enthusiasm has been fueled by a recent court decision in favor of Grayscale, which has increased the likelihood of converting its prominent GBTC product into an ETF. Additionally, BlackRock’s application to list a Bitcoin ETF took a noteworthy step as its proposed product, IBTC, was assigned a unique ID number on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. website. According to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, while this does not signify ETF approval, many observers interpreted it as a sign of the company’s confidence in the eventual success of its application. The iShares Bitcoin Trust has been listed on the DTCC (Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, which clears NASDAQ trades). And the ticker will be $IBTC. Again all part of the process of bringing ETF to market.. h/t @martypartymusic pic.twitter.com/8PQP3h2yW0 Meanwhile, finance lawyer Scott Johnson revealed that Blackrock has already obtained seeding for its Bitcoin ETF. Balchunas clarified, however, that the seeding or the initial investment is usually a modest amount that’s just sufficient to kickstart an ETF. With that, it’s important not to misinterpret this as a significant acquisition of Bitcoin by BlackRock. Rather, their action of seeding and making it public marks another progression in the path toward launching the ETF. BlackRock stating in their recent spot Bitcoin ETF amendment that they are seeding the ETF in October. Don’t want to read that much into it but it is new info not in original filing so noteworthy (esp bc they BlackRock). Great catch by Scott. https://t.co/CGBmuTJ7W0   Stefan Rust, CEO of independent inflation data aggregator Truflation and former CEO of Bitcoin.com believes that we are in the early stages of a “Crypto Spring” and that it I likely that some Bitcoin ETFs will be approved in the coming months. There is a sense that this US ETF is actually real now – after years and years of waiting. Among the 21+ submissions sitting with the SEC, it seems likely some five to six will be approved in one go. On the technical side, Bitcoin’s 20-day moving average has recently risen slightly higher than its 200-day moving average. This development is generally seen as a favorable sign. In relation to this, numerous traders are eagerly anticipating the much-discussed “golden cross,” which involves the 50-day moving average crossing above the 200-day moving average. This is considered a crucial indicator in the cryptocurrency market that signals an uptrend or upcoming bullish scenario. To wrap things up, the recent surge in Bitcoin’s value and the positive outlook in the cryptocurrency market have sparked discussions of whether the crypto winter is truly over. With Bitcoin trading at a substantial 24-hour gain and reaching a 52-week peak, optimism is running high. One major factor contributing to this bullish sentiment is the anticipation of a Bitcoin ETF. Institutional investors appear to be increasing their investments in cryptocurrencies, further driving the market upwards. Moreover, BlackRock’s involvement in the ETF space has garnered attention, although it’s essential to note that the initial seeding amount should not be misconstrued as a significant Bitcoin acquisition. Technically, Bitcoin’s moving averages are aligning favorably, with the prospect of a “golden cross” on the horizon, a crucial indicator signaling a potential uptrend. But then again, amidst this optimism, traders should exercise caution. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and past performance is not always indicative of future results. It’s crucial to conduct thorough research, have a well-defined investment strategy, consider other factors outside the things discussed here, and consider the potential risks before riding the bandwagon."
2023-10-20 07:30:15+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Hits $29,000 As Ripple Executives Walk Scott Free From SEC’s Clutches",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-hits-29000-following-ripple-sec-developments/,"Bitcoin price is now firmly in the $29,000 region after news of the SEC dropping its lawsuit against Ripple executives broke on Thursday. The two top officials, Brad Garlinghouse and Christian Larsen were facing a lawsuit as individual defendants in the Ripple versus SEC lawsuit. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP BREAKING: CASE DISMISSED AGAINST BRAD GARLINGHOUSE AND CHRIS LARSEN pic.twitter.com/BYTe9152jM Bitcoin price rose sharply and broke the $29,000 mark, effectively trying to break out of the prolonged consolidation zone it has been in but entering another larger one on the macro timeframe. Earlier this week, Bitcoin price skyrocketed by 10% after Cointelegraph posted an inaccurate tweet hinting that the SEC had approved iShares (owned by Blackrock) Bitcoin ETF. Riding on the rumours, Bitcoin hit a high of $29,900 on Bitstamp and $31,000 on other exchanges. However, as the reality of the inaccuracy of the news dawned on the market, the price of Bitcoin subsided and closed Monday, October 16, 2023, at $28,518. Since then, Bitcoin has been gradually rising. Last week’s BTC analysis shows that the asset is up 10.3% and still rising. To break out of the range shown in the chart, Bitcoin must be another +8.66% from here and close above $31,817. Given the rumours surrounding Bitcoin ETFs, this might happen any day soon. The rise in BTC’s price pushed it well above the 200-day and 50–day moving averages. When the price is above these two indicators, it signifies the market it bullish on the asset in question. The RSI (14) is up 53% from last week’s level of 45. Past the 70-level, BTC becomes an overbought asset. SEC dropping its lawsuit against Ripple executives led to significant volatility in the crypto market, particularly in Bitcoin’s price. Speculation of Grayscale pushing forward with its Bitcoin ETF plans may result in boosted values. ICYMI: BlackRock filed an updated spot Bitcoin ETF application after SEC feedback earlier today.

2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2023-10-17 14:00:00+00:00,Cointelegraph Credibility Shaken After Media Outlet Manipulates BTC Price By Over 10%,https://blockzeit.com/cointelegraph-manipulates-btc-price/,"Bitcoin flash pumped nearly 10% on Monday after Cointelegraph and other crypto media sites falsely claimed that the SEC has approved a BTC Spot ETF. However, Bitcoin gave up almost all its gains after asset manager BlackRock denied that regulators had approved its high-profile application for a crypto investment product. Earlier, BTC was trading at around $28,211, a 3.82% increase, after which it saw a rise of as much as 10% to over $29,900, its highest price since August. Crypto news outlet Cointelegraph had earlier reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved an application by major asset manager BlackRock for a Spot BTC ETF before retracting the story. “We apologize for a tweet that led to the dissemination of inaccurate information regarding the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF,” Cointelegraph said in a follow-up statement on social media. Cointelegraph issues apology after falsely announcing that BlackRock's Spot #Bitcoin    ETF was approved by the SEC.An announcement that saw the market pump. pic.twitter.com/cLNrCqHyUJ The apology came after a Fox Business reporter said on social media platform X that BlackRock denied the report. This caused the price of Bitcoin to fall sharply. 🚨BlackRock has just confirmed to me that this is false. Their application is still under review. https://t.co/XIfIWZ0Ule BlackRock later confirmed that the iShares Bitcoin ETF application is still under review by the SEC. The crypto space awaits news on various pending Spot BTC ETF applications. If approved, they are widely expected to drive investment in the sector. The SEC has since denied all BTC ETF applications, claiming that applicants have not shown any capacity to protect investors from market manipulation. While the news on Monday came in as a false alarm, it shows how the market could behave when the regulator delivers a final decision on the applications. However, it is also essential for investors to remain cautious, as anything is possible concerning the SEC. Bitcoin’s price rally on Monday led to the liquidations of over $100 million of long and short positions.

2023-10-16 14:00:00+00:00,What Do The US Government And Whales Know About Bitcoin That We Don’t?,https://blockzeit.com/us-government-and-whales-accumulate-bitcoin/,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, one thing is clear: Bitcoin (BTC) is on the government’s radar. Recent reports have unveiled a staggering $5 billion stash of the digital asset held by the US federal government, stemming from strategic operations against cybercrime and darknet activities. Simultaneously, Bitcoin whales, individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of the cryptocurrency, have been engaging in a bullish mission, accumulating massive volumes of BTC even as retail holders seem to be selling. What could these enigmatic moves indicate? Let’s delve into the speculations surrounding Bitcoin that the government and whales may be privy to. The US government’s Bitcoin accumulation is no mere coincidence. It is the result of a series of calculated efforts to combat cybercrime, going back to high-profile cases like the Bitfinex cyber attack and the takedown of Silk Road in 2013. The figures, as reported by The Wall Street Journal, reveal that the government holds an astounding $5 billion worth of Bitcoin. These clandestine operations represent only a glimpse of a broader strategy. While we can’t read the minds of government officials, their strategic Bitcoin accumulation hints at a belief in its long-term value. Could they foresee Bitcoin becoming a significant part of the financial landscape in the long run? The timing of their actions is intriguing, given the current crypto market’s rollercoaster ride. However, one must also question why the government refused to sell its holdings during bull periods, especially at its peak in 2021 when it was trading $68,991 a pop. Did they simply intentionally or unintentionally miss the train, or are they in for a longer play? On the other side of the Bitcoin spectrum, whales are actively accumulating large volumes of the digital currency. As per @ali_charts’ analysis on the evening of October 15, they’ve amassed a substantial 117 BTC tokens valued at $3.2 million in just a 48-hour timeframe. This accumulation has transpired while retail holders have been selling off their holdings, causing Bitcoin’s price to hover around $26,905.66 at that time. As of this writing at 10:00 AM UTC time on Monday, the digital asset is now trading at $27,784.10. #Bitcoin whales bought around 117 $BTC in the past 48 hours, worth roughly $3.2 million. pic.twitter.com/Aoshmy0r4D The contrast between whale actions and retail selling raises questions. Do these savvy investors possess insider knowledge, or are they making speculative moves? Their accumulation suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s future, but what drives this belief? And what role might they play in the cryptocurrency’s broader adoption? The recent refusal by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to appeal a court ruling in favor of Grayscale Investment regarding its Bitcoin Trust is an intriguing development. This decision paves the way for the potential conversion of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust into a full-fledged Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Market experts now suggest a 90% chance of ETF approval, with the SEC poised to discuss the matter in the coming weeks. What’s remarkable about this regulatory development is the possibility that Grayscale could be the gateway for Bitcoin ETF products, ushering them into the cryptocurrency market. But what might this mean for the future of Bitcoin? Government accumulation and whale investment are two sides of the same coin, with each potentially poised to benefit significantly if the ETF is approved. Their actions could be part of a more comprehensive strategy to position themselves for what’s to come. In the world of Bitcoin, balance is crucial. The interplay between retail investors, whales, and government actions is a delicate dance. While retail holders may be slow to catch on, the combined efforts of whales and government accumulation suggest a calculated move towards a brighter Bitcoin future. A forthcoming bullish run and a potential return to all-time highs may be on the horizon, and those who position themselves wisely could reap substantial rewards. Bitcoin’s enigmatic journey is a multifaceted narrative. The government’s strategic accumulation of the cryptocurrency and the bullish maneuvers of whales imply a deeper understanding of its potential. While we can only speculate about their motives and insights, it’s clear that the digital asset’s future holds significant promise, and those who navigate these mysterious waters wisely may emerge as winners. For now, it’s essential to remain vigilant, as there is much more to this story yet to unfold."
2023-10-16 06:00:00+00:00,Security Concerns Emerge As Chinese Bitcoin Mining Operations Proliferate Across The US,https://blockzeit.com/chinese-bitcoin-mining-in-us/,"The exponential growth of Chinese-affiliated Bitcoin mining operations in the United States has raised red flags related to national security. These mining facilities, spanning across a dozen states, including Arkansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming, now collectively consume power on par with approximately 1.5 million American households. The emergence of Chinese companies, most notably Bitmain in the midst of the cryptocurrency boom, has given rise to considerable inquiries regarding the security implications inherent in these foreign-linked mining ventures. Across the U.S., a sense of unease is growing over a recent surge in Chinese bitcoin mines — and the national security threat they may pose. | via @nytimes https://t.co/uSgds7Dib4 According to a report by the Japan Times, Chinese Bitcoin mining operations in the US are not just drawing financial worries but also raising alarms regarding their energy consumption. Large warehouses filled with specialized computers are running continuously to mine cryptocurrencies, putting immense pressure on local power grids. The massive energy requirements of these mining facilities have the potential to stress the grid, leading to concerns about possible blackouts and cyberattacks. Former Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection at the Department of Homeland Security, Brian Harrell, highlights the danger of these mining operations operating in concert, stressing the grid and disrupting vital services. While Bitcoin mining provides economic opportunities, the impact on critical energy systems demands thorough investigation and scrutiny. Cryptocurrency mining has seen a significant surge in the US in recent years, with operations consuming roughly 4,000 megawatts, equivalent to powering more than 3 million US households. Furthermore, these mining operations possess unique flexibility, enabling them to participate in programs that pay them to shut down during grid strain. However, the unpredictability of these shutdowns can disrupt the delicate balance that energy grids require for stability. These mining operations also pose potential security risks, as many of them have digital connections to grid operators, which, if not managed properly, could result in critical system intrusions. Bitmain, a Chinese enterprise renowned for its expertise in mining equipment, has solidified its position as a prominent figure in the industry. Import records indicate that the company has shipped a significant amount of equipment to the US, driven by China’s ban on Bitcoin mining due to concerns about energy consumption and economic stability. Though no overt connection between the firm and Chinese authorities is evident, reports have surfaced regarding equipment shipments to the US facilitated via a subsidiary situated at a Communist Party-affiliated location in southern China. The past discovery of “back doors” in Bitmain’s equipment, which would have allowed covert remote operation, has raised concerns about the security implications. These vulnerabilities are a potential risk, especially in light of growing concerns about Chinese cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. Microsoft, in collaboration with US government authorities, has voiced profound apprehension concerning the security red flags associated with Chinese Bitcoin mining activities, especially when these operations are situated in such immediate proximity to crucial infrastructure. Notably, the presence of a mining facility in Cheyenne, Wyoming, which stands adjacent to a Microsoft data center serving the Pentagon and an Air Force base. The infrastructures happen to be the ones responsible for controlling nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles in the country, which is triggering substantial concerns. The software giant has suggested that the presence of an industrial-level crypto-mining operation near sensitive military installations creates significant threat vectors, although no direct malicious activities have been detected so far. The proliferation of Chinese-owned or operated Bitcoin mining operations in the United States is driving national security concerns. As these mining facilities exert pressure on local power grids, the risk of targeted blackouts and cyberattacks looms large. Bitmain’s dominance in the market and past vulnerabilities in its equipment further compound these concerns. While these operations offer economic opportunities, the potential impact on critical energy systems and national security demands thorough scrutiny."
2023-10-13 08:00:00+00:00,Bitcoin Inheritance: Exploring The Pros And Cons Of This Digital Legacy,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-inheritance-exploring-the-pros-and-cons-of-this-digital-legacy/,"In the modern world, where digital assets play an increasingly significant role, individuals are exploring innovative ways to secure their legacies. One such approach gaining attention is converting inheritance to Bitcoin. By leveraging the advantages of this decentralized digital currency, individuals aim to streamline the transfer of wealth, ensuring accessibility, security, and privacy for their beneficiaries. However, like any financial decision, there are pros and cons to consider before embracing this unique form of inheritance. Start planning your #bitcoin inheritance today at 👉 https://t.co/5vx8dLrwLq pic.twitter.com/o5qTGjYD2o Recently, an opinion piece from Bitcoin Magazine discussed the benefits and intricacies involved in the conversion of inheritance to Bitcoin. From the things laid out there, the following insights can be gleaned: Bitcoin’s accessibility is a key advantage for digital inheritance. Unlike physical assets that require logistical arrangements and expertise, Bitcoin can be easily accessed with a 256-bit long combination, known as a private key. This feature allows beneficiaries to swiftly and globally access the inherited wealth without waiting for lengthy legal processes. Bitcoin’s blockchain technology ensures robust security for inherited funds. While the ownership of Bitcoin can be traced through wallets, the decentralized nature of the blockchain adds a layer of anonymity and protection against security risks. By carefully managing private keys and utilizing advanced security measures, individuals can safeguard their digital fortune for future generations. Additionally, the use of multi-signature wallets and hardware DeFi wallets further enhances the security of Bitcoin holdings, requiring multiple authentication factors for any transactions or access attempts. With these measures in place, individuals can have peace of mind knowing that their digital assets are well-protected against potential threats. Another advantage of Bitcoin inheritance is privacy. Unlike traditional assets that may be subject to public scrutiny during the probate process, Bitcoin allows individuals to maintain confidentiality. While the transactions on the blockchain are transparent, the identities behind the wallet addresses can remain discreet, ensuring that the inherited wealth remains private. One challenge of Bitcoin inheritance lies in the technical knowledge required for beneficiaries to manage and navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency ownership. To address this, educating heirs about the intricacies of Bitcoin and providing comprehensive documentation can empower them to effectively handle the inherited digital assets. Moreover, Bitcoin’s price volatility poses a potential risk for those considering it as a store of value to pass on. The fluctuating nature of the cryptocurrency market means that the value of the inherited Bitcoin can change significantly over time. This can be remedied by allocating a portion of coins to each beneficiary, ensuring a steady growth of savings for them regardless of the market’s volatility or the number of coins the benefactor possesses. By maintaining the appropriate percentage for each recipient, the benefactor can rest assured that the assets will be distributed accordingly. Incorporating Bitcoin into inheritance planning offers both advantages and challenges. The accessibility, security, and privacy provided by this decentralized digital currency streamline the transfer of wealth and empower beneficiaries in the modern digital landscape. However, technical competence and the volatility of the cryptocurrency market are factors that must be carefully considered. Notwithstanding the inherent issues, by educating heirs, providing clear documentation, and adapting to the evolving financial landscape, individuals can embrace Bitcoin as a means to leave a lasting digital legacy."
2023-10-12 12:00:00+00:00,Unlocking The Potential Of Bitcoin Options: Strategies And Benefits,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-options-strategies/,"Bitcoin has undergone a significant evolution since its inception. As a decentralized digital currency, it has attracted an ever-growing community of enthusiasts, investors, and traders. This widespread interest has led to various financial instruments interacting with this groundbreaking asset. One such financial instrument is Bitcoin options. We explore Bitcoin options and their fundamentals.   Bitcoin options exist similarly to Bitcoin futures in the form of derivatives. They are a type of financial derivative contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific amount of Bitcoin at a predetermined price (the strike price) within a particular time frame. Bitcoin options trading is preferable to buying Bitcoin because buying an option costs less than the actual asset. Unlike buying and holding BTC, Bitcoin options present a leverage opportunity to take speculative positions on BTC’s price movement. Considering how volatile the cryptocurrency asset is, Bitcoin options open up an avenue for investors and traders to speculate the asset’s price at a fraction of the cost. There are two primary types of Bitcoin options: Call Options: A call option gives the holder the right to buy Bitcoin at the strike price before expiration. Call options are typically used by traders who expect the price of Bitcoin to rise, allowing them to benefit from the price increase while limiting their downside risk. If your prediction was correct, and the market price increased above the Bitcoin option’s strike, you could buy bitcoin at the pre-specified price. How far the underlying bitcoin price rose past the strike price would influence how much profit you’d make from the trade.  If your prediction was incorrect, and the Bitcoin price declined instead, you could let the options contract expire worthless and only lose the premium you paid to open the trade. Put Options: On the other hand, a put option gives the holder the right to sell Bitcoin at the strike price before the expiration date. Put options are used by traders anticipating a decline in Bitcoin’s price, allowing them to profit from the decrease while mitigating potential losses. If your prediction was correct, and the bitcoin price declined below your chosen strike price, you could sell your Bitcoin holding at a higher price than the new market value. How far the underlying bitcoin price decreased below the strike price would influence how much profit you’d make from the trade. If your prediction was incorrect, and the Bitcoin price increased instead, you could let the options contract expire, and you’d only lose the premium. Bitcoin options have key elements in their contract, which include: The strike price and expiration date are two crucial elements of a Bitcoin options contract. The strike price is the price at which the option holder can buy (for call options) or sell (for put options) the underlying Bitcoin. The expiration date specifies the period within which the option holder can exercise their rights. For example, if a trader holds a call option with a strike price of $60,000 and an expiration date of three months from the purchase date, they can buy Bitcoin for $60,000 at any time within the next three months. American options can be exercised before or on the expiration date. This flexibility allows for more excellent strategic maneuverability. On the other hand, European options can only be exercised on the expiration date. They offer less flexibility but often come with lower premiums. The Greeks entail those terms used to describe different factors influencing an option’s price. They determine whether one will pay more to open an option contract. They also determine if one should receive more in the case of writing options. Several advantages come with trading Bitcoin options, which include: Bitcoin options have become an integral part of the cryptocurrency market, offering traders and investors an array of strategic possibilities for managing risk and profiting from Bitcoin’s price movements. However, trading options carry risks, especially in the highly volatile cryptocurrency space. It’s essential to understand the mechanics of Bitcoin options thoroughly, have a clear strategy, and use reliable and reputable trading platforms to navigate this exciting and rapidly evolving market."
2023-10-11 16:00:00+00:00,Decoding The 16-Year Bitcoin Cycle And Its Deeper Connection To The Dotcom Boom,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-16-year-cycle/,"Cryptocurrency enthusiasts and financial experts have remained deeply intrigued by the price oscillations of Bitcoin (BTC). The widely discussed four-year cycle, which has become a central point of interest, raises the question: could this four-year pattern merely be a segment of a more extensive 16-year cycle? Perhaps, this extended sacred timeline carries the essential insights needed to decode the digital asset’s future price evolution. In this article, we will delve into a novel theory proposed by Jeroen van Lange that introduces the idea of a 16-year Bitcoin cycle and its intriguing correlation to the Dotcom bubble era. The conventional wisdom surrounding Bitcoin revolves around its four-year cycle, divided into an uptrend and a downtrend. This four-year cycle, which features three years of bullish momentum followed by one year of bearish market behavior, has historically displayed remarkable precision in capturing the attention of market participants. It’s a pattern that has intrigued investors and traders alike. Drawing parallels between the market dynamics of Bitcoin and the S&P 500 during the Dotcom era presents a captivating narrative. Both underwent distinct four-year cycles, characterized by extended periods of bullish trends succeeded by shorter-lived bearish phases. Notably, the Dotcom cycle’s origin is often attributed to the momentous Microsoft initial public offering in 1986. What makes this correlation even more thought-provoking is the simultaneous emergence of Bitcoin and the Dotcom era, both driven by groundbreaking technologies that have reshaped our global interaction. While the Dotcom era ushered in personal computing and the internet into our daily lives, Bitcoin now stands at the forefront of reshaping the financial landscape. The burning question remains: Can the Dotcom cycle’s structure offer insights into the future of Bitcoin? While history may not replicate itself, it often rhymes, and cycles are no exception. The Dotcom cycle reveals an interesting pattern: three four-year cycles marked by a prolonged bullish market and a relatively brief bear market, followed by a departure from this pattern in the fourth cycle. This final cycle begins with a price acceleration that is short-lived and is followed by a protracted bear market. Interestingly, this echoes the path taken by Microsoft. After three right-translated four-year cycles, Microsoft’s trajectory shifted to a left-translated cycle, resulting in a prolonged bear market following a period of strong bullish activity. Microsoft’s all-time high in 2000 wasn’t surpassed until 2015, demonstrating the significance of a correction after an extended bull market. One intriguing aspect of van Lange’s theory is the convergence of both the four-year cycle and the 16-year cycle, suggesting a common outcome. According to the conventional four-year cycle, Bitcoin is expected to remain in an uptrend until 2025, followed by a year-long decline, a pattern observed three times before. In contrast, the 16-year cycle predicts that Bitcoin will peak by the end of 2024. This is reminiscent of the Dotcom bubble era, which could be followed by a multi-year downturn extending into 2026. Identifying the peak of a Bitcoin cycle can be challenging but essential for traders. Two valuable indicators to gauge market sentiment are Bitcoin funding rates and price movements relative to swing lows. In a healthy bull market, negative funding rates coincide with upward price trends, while a bear market sees positive funding rates accompany price declines. Watching for price movements below a swing low can be another signal, with breaking above it again serving as validation. The Bitcoin cycle’s progression bars can further help discern periods of potential peaks. External factors, on the other hand, possess the potential to disrupt even the most meticulously observed market cycles. For Bitcoin, these external forces include regulatory changes, technological advancements, and global economic shifts. Regulatory decisions by governments worldwide could significantly impact the cryptocurrency landscape, either by endorsing or constraining its growth. For instance, the Federal Reserve’s substantial monetary injections starting in 2020 significantly influenced the market. As money supply surged, investors turned to the financial markets and Bitcoin as safe havens, driving prices up. Conversely, as the money printer slowed in 2022, Bitcoin faced a year of decline. Likewise, technological innovations, such as quantum computing, could pose security threats that require adaptations in Bitcoin’s infrastructure. Additionally, macroeconomic events, like financial crises or geopolitical tensions, can exert unexpected pressures on Bitcoin’s value. In a realm characterized by innovation and uncertainty, vigilance beyond cyclic patterns is essential for comprehending Bitcoin’s future trajectory. The Bitcoin cycle, with its four-year segments on its way to its 16th year, is a captivating concept that could offer a more profound understanding of the cryptocurrency’s price behavior. While the correlation with the Dotcom era is striking, we must remember that Bitcoin’s journey is likely to be unique. With this, keeping an eye on both internal and external factors will be crucial in predicting the path of this ever-evolving digital asset."

In the crypto space, one of the key metrics often capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike is Bitcoin’s hashrate. #Bitcoin hashrate hits a new ATH. First time hashrate has increased in a bear market 👀 pic.twitter.com/e1Y2oXzMtm On September 15, Bitcoin’s hashrate hit another ATH, which sparked speculation on where the digital gold’s price is headed. Bitcoin’s hashrate represents the total computational power dedicated to Bitcoin mining and securing the network. It is a crucial metric that indicates the network’s health and security. When the hashrate hits the top, it generally shows an increased interest and investment in Bitcoin mining, often interpreted as a bullish sign for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s price is still struggling, aiming to reach an all-time high and registering a steep decline. However, miners have remained resolute about the asset as they continue investing more. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s dominance was between 39% and 49% for more than two years before it broke out to 52% after its hashrate surged. One of the most common patterns following a hashrate surge is an increase in Bitcoin’s price, typically not exceeding 10%, followed by a more substantial sell-off. As such, it may initially boost the market but can also be seen as a signal of short-term price instability. Given this historical context, it’s worth considering where Bitcoin’s price may be headed in the short term. The current push in the price of Bitcoin might bring it closer to the $29,000 mark. In such a scenario, it is possible that Bitcoin’s price could explore regions below $24,000 soon. Bitcoin has been unable to restart a surge since its recent pullback, as its price continues to float around the $27,700 level. This recent ATH in Bitcoin’s hashrate is a reminder that the cryptocurrency market is highly dynamic, with various factors influencing its price movements. Investors and traders should exercise caution and consider multiple indicators and historical patterns when making investment decisions."

The billionaire Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, and close confidant of Warren Buffett, recently reaffirmed his stance on two of the most hotly debated topics in the tech and financial industries: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Bitcoin.  Munger’s unapologetic and critical views have once again stirred the conversation around these groundbreaking technologies. Speaking at the Zoomtopia Conference organized by Zoom Communications, Charlie Munger did not mince words when discussing the current state of AI. He labeled it as “overhyped,” arguing that it is receiving more attention than it deserves. While acknowledging AI’s undeniable potential, Munger remained skeptical about the extent to which it can deliver on its promises. Despite the recent buzz around AI, Munger’s skepticism about its impact is not new. He had previously expressed similar doubts at Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholder meetings, asserting that traditional intelligence still holds its ground and cautioning against unrealistic expectations. AI has seen substantial advancements, with platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT gaining over 100 million users in just a few weeks. Tech giants such as Microsoft and Google are pouring billions into AI research and development. However, Munger believes that some of the breakthroughs in AI are “exaggerated,” indicating a divide in opinions regarding the technology’s potential. While Munger’s skepticism stands in contrast to the optimism of many tech leaders, there remains a consensus on the need to establish appropriate frameworks for AI to ensure its responsible usage and mitigate potential risks. Read: Does Crypto Enemy Number 1 Warren Buffet Own Bitcoin? Charlie Munger’s criticism extends beyond AI to the world of cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin being his primary target. He didn’t hold back, stating unequivocally, “Don’t get me started on Bitcoins — that was the stupidest investment I ever saw.” Munger’s criticisms of Bitcoin are not new either. Over the years, he has compared Bitcoin to “rat poison” and other cryptocurrencies to harmful infections. In the past, he even urged the US government to ban Bitcoin, characterizing it as speculative gambling. Warren Buffett, Munger’s close associate, has echoed his skepticism, referring to Bitcoin as a “gambling token.” Despite the criticism from Munger and other traditional finance figures, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience and growth. It has established itself as an asset class with substantial value, often outperforming traditional financial assets. The cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, continues to attract widespread interest and investment. Read: Warren Buffett Hates Bitcoin: Who Cares? The viewpoints expressed by Charlie Munger on AI and Bitcoin are not isolated. They reflect the ongoing debate surrounding these disruptive technologies. While critics like Munger emphasize caution and skepticism, proponents argue for the transformative potential of AI and the financial opportunities presented by cryptocurrencies. In the case of AI, the technology is already making significant strides in various sectors, from healthcare to finance. Similar innovations showcase the capabilities of AI in natural language understanding and generation. Even tech companies continue to explore ways to harness AI’s power for societal benefit. On the other hand, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have gained widespread recognition and adoption, with Bitcoin’s value surpassing traditional assets like gold. Despite market fluctuations, cryptocurrencies have become a legitimate investment option for many. The contrasting perspectives on these technologies highlight the evolving nature of the tech and finance industries. While critics raise valid concerns, they also face the challenge of keeping pace with rapid technological advancements and shifting market dynamics. As the debates surrounding AI and cryptocurrencies continue, it is clear that these technologies are here to stay, and their impact on society and finance will only grow in significance. In this evolving landscape, it remains essential for stakeholders to engage in constructive dialogues that balance skepticism with optimism to unlock the full potential of these transformative technologies."
2023-10-09 04:00:00+00:00,How Is Bitcoin Reacting To The Israel-Palestine Conflict,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-reaction-to-israel-palestine-conflict/,"In the wake of the recent Israel-Palestine conflict, the world’s attention has been drawn to the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. While the tensions have far-reaching implications, one unexpected factor remains unshaken amidst the turmoil: the price stability of Bitcoin (BTC). Despite the escalating violence and the profound impact on the lives of both Israelis and Palestinians, Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, has exhibited remarkable resilience. Over the weekend, as the conflict unfolded, the digital asset’s price only experienced minimal fluctuations, defying conventional expectations. Just hours after Israel officially declared a state of war, BTC was treading just below the $28,000 mark. This only reflects around 0.20% decline in its value within the 24-hour period. Historically, geopolitical crises have often triggered significant market reactions. However, Bitcoin appears to be an exception to this trend, as it remained relatively unaffected during the brief 2021 Israeli-Gaza conflict and continues to exhibit a similar pattern during the current crisis. Gaza, a region deeply affected by the war, is home to a population of approximately two million people. While Bitcoin technology has already made its way into the area, its relatively small population makes it unlikely to exert a substantial impact on the global cryptocurrency market. During past crises, Hamas, the governing authority in Gaza, has even sought donations in Bitcoin, but the scale of such transactions has not been sufficient to significantly influence Bitcoin’s price. This raises the question of whether Bitcoin’s immunity to geopolitical unrest may be attributed to factors beyond the reach of the conflict’s impact. One potential explanation for Bitcoin’s indifference to the Israel-Palestine conflict lies in its financial significance. While the tension has undoubtedly resulted in human tragedy and turmoil, it is arguably not an immediate financial threat on a global scale or in the realm of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, as a decentralized digital currency, operates independently of traditional financial institutions and national economies. It should be noted, however, that the financial implications of the conflict remain uncertain in the coming times. The duration and cost of the war, as well as the potential methods of financing it, could have repercussions for global financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. If the event continues for an extended period and places a significant financial burden on the involved parties, Bitcoin’s response may change. Governments could resort to printing money or taking on debt to cover the expenses, which could lead to inflation and a loss of confidence in fiat currencies. In such a scenario, Bitcoin, often hailed as a hedge against inflation and economic instability, might experience increased interest and investment. Investors seeking to protect their wealth from currency devaluation and economic uncertainty might turn to Bitcoin as a store of value, potentially driving its price upward. As the Israel-Palestine conflict unfolds, Bitcoin’s price resilience is indeed a unique phenomenon. While the issue’s direct impact on Bitcoin may not be felt, the broader financial consequences, including inflation and economic instability, could influence the cryptocurrency’s performance if the crisis drags on. Bitcoin continues to demonstrate its ability to operate independently of traditional financial systems and geopolitical events. Its role as a financial asset and store of value in times of uncertainty remains a topic of growing interest, and as the conflict evolves, so too will the global financial landscape."
2023-10-06 04:09:26+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Gets Rejected At 28K As BTC Trade Volume On Binance Drops To A 4-Month Low,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-gets-rejected-at-28k/,"Bitcoin price made a run for the $28,500 resistance level earlier this week but got sharply rejected as bears emerged to have some control on the market. The price of Bitcoin now sits at 27,493. In last week’s analysis, we saw several notable liquidity hunt zones around $25,000 and $28,000, one of which was hit this week. Price rose sharply to 28,500, obliterating the shorts and triggering the buy stops that had been set around this resistance level. BTC’s recent surge pushed the asset toward the upper boundary of the current range. While it is unclear what may have caused the sudden spike in price, the crypto community thinks it was the launch of the Ethereum ETFs. If BTC successfully breaks out of the current range, it could achieve an average gain of 15.69%, bringing it to the second resistance level of $31,570. On the 4-hour chart, BTC is trending above the 50 (green) and 200-day (white) moving averages. In fact, a golden cross just formed in this timeframe. This could signify a bullish October for this asset.On the Daily timeframe, price is also trending above these EMA indicators, indicating that bulls may also have some level of control in the market. The Bitcoin RSI has been going up for the past couple of months since it hit a low of 14.46 on August 18. Since then RSI is up 399% and price up 11%. The RSI works in a way such that when the price enters the over-sold area, that is an indicator to enter long positions, and vice versa. RSI is sitting at 59-level showing some room for BTC to still move upwards. As Bitcoin price struggles to move up, trade volumes on Binance are down 48% in the month of September. The last time BTC trade volume on Binance was at this level was in April 2023.

2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2023-10-03 08:00:00+00:00,Satoshi Nakamoto Resurfaces: What Could Be Its Implications For Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/satoshi-nakamoto-resurfaces-what-could-be-its-implications-for-bitcoin/,"In a surprising turn of events, the mysterious entity behind the pseudonym ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ has returned to the cryptocurrency scene after years of silence. This enigmatic figure, who introduced the world to Bitcoin over a decade ago, recently resurfaced on the social media platform X, sparking intense discussions, skepticism, and curiosity within the cryptocurrency community. With the potential implications for Bitcoin’s future, this unexpected resurgence of the pseudonymous cryptographer has captivated the crypto world’s attention. After a prolonged absence from public attention and online forums since around 2010, the reappearance of Satoshi Nakamoto on social media under the handle @satoshi has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The last known communication from the Bitcoin creator dates back to 2018, leaving the crypto community in suspense for several years. This surprising return to the limelight has raised several questions about the true identity of Satoshi and the motivations behind this sudden resurgence. While the initial allure of Bitcoin lies in its decentralized nature and the absence of a single central authority, the reappearance of Satoshi challenges this very principle. The tweet posted by the @satoshi account upon its return has triggered a flurry of speculation and debate. This message suggests an exploration of ideas and concepts not explicitly outlined in the original Bitcoin white paper, which laid the foundation for the cryptocurrency revolution. With over 4.5 million views as of this writing at 6:00 AM UTC time, it has certainly caught the attention of the crypto community. However, skepticism abounds regarding the authenticity of this social media account. The crypto community remains divided, with some believing it to be a genuine return of Satoshi, while others dismiss it as a possible hoax or “larping” attempt (live-action role-playing). This skepticism arises from the fact that X, the platform hosting the @satoshi account, now allows users to obtain verified badges through a paid subscription, a policy introduced by its new owner, Elon Musk. The resurgence of Satoshi, whether genuine or not, has the potential to impact Bitcoin’s reputation and the broader cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has long been heralded as a decentralized and trustless digital currency, with no central figurehead. The return of Satoshi raises concerns about the possibility of centralization and the potential for manipulation by a single entity, which goes against the core principles of Bitcoin. This development also underscores the challenges of maintaining anonymity in the digital age. Satoshi’s initial decision to remain anonymous added to Bitcoin’s mystique and trustworthiness. However, if this social media account is indeed linked to the true Satoshi, it suggests that even the most secretive individuals can be unmasked in an era of advanced technology and social media. While the reappearance of Satoshi may have created a buzz within the crypto community, its long-term impact on Bitcoin remains uncertain. Many experts and enthusiasts believe that Bitcoin’s strength lies in its decentralized nature and the fact that it has thrived without a known leader. Whether Satoshi’s return will influence the direction of Bitcoin’s development or adoption is still a matter of debate and something to watch out for. The unexpected resurgence of Satoshi Nakamoto has injected intrigue and uncertainty into the world of cryptocurrencies. While the authenticity of the @satoshi account remains in question, its mere existence challenges the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin. As the crypto community continues to grapple with the implications, one thing is clear: the enigmatic cryptographer’s return has once again pushed the boundaries of what is known in the world of cryptocurrency."
2023-10-03 06:00:00+00:00,Elon Musk Calls Fiat Currencies A Scam,https://blockzeit.com/elon-musk-calls-fiat-currencies-a-scam/,"In a series of recent tweets, Elon Musk, the renowned CEO of X (formerly Twitter) and the world’s richest individual, has ignited intense discussions in the cryptocurrency world. Musk made headlines when he boldly declared fiat currencies as “scams” and hinted at a potential return to Bitcoin. Last Sunday, Elon Musk sent shockwaves through social media when he expressed his view that fiat currencies, such as the US dollar, euro, and real, are essentially “scams.”  Fiat currency The tweet, which garnered over 600,000 views in less than 24 hours, came in response to a question asking what had become so normalized that people no longer realized it was a scam. “Fiat Currencies,” replied Musk succinctly. This declaration is not the first time Musk has been in the cryptocurrency spotlight.  Earlier in 2021, his electric vehicle company, Tesla, invested a staggering $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. However, Tesla later sold a substantial portion of its Bitcoin holdings, citing concerns over liquidity and labeling Bitcoin as a “sideshow.” Musk’s recent statements have raised speculation among cryptocurrency enthusiasts that he may be considering a return to Bitcoin. Bitcoin, with its capped supply of 21 million, stands in stark contrast to fiat currencies, which can be printed indefinitely, potentially leading to the erosion of their purchasing power. This scarcity model has long been one of Bitcoin’s core value propositions. Financial analysts suggest that despite Musk’s vast wealth, much of which is tied up in shares of his companies, substantial sums of money remain in their coffers. This leads to speculation that Musk might be contemplating significant investments in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. While Musk’s tweet had a notable impact on the cryptocurrency community, the immediate market response was somewhat muted.  Bitcoin experienced a 4% increase in value on the day following Musk’s tweet surging past $28,000, but many attribute this rise to factors unrelated to his comments, such as the introduction of Ethereum Futures ETFs in the US. Nonetheless, Musk’s history of influencing crypto markets through his social media presence cannot be ignored. The market will be closely watching for any follow-up actions or statements from the billionaire entrepreneur. Elon Musk’s recent declaration about fiat currencies being “scams” has once again thrust him into the center of the cryptocurrency conversation. While it remains to be seen whether Musk will re-enter the cryptocurrency market, his statements have reignited discussions about the future of traditional currencies and the role of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, in the global financial landscape. The cryptocurrency community eagerly awaits further developments and potential investments from the influential CEO."
2023-10-02 10:00:00+00:00,Uptober Sparks Bitcoin Surge Amidst Mounting US Debt Concerns,https://blockzeit.com/uptober-sparks-bitcoin-surge-amidst-mounting-us-debt-concerns/,"The crypto market is buzzing with excitement as October, affectionately dubbed “Uptober,” ushers in a surprising uptick in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices. This sudden shift has fueled speculation about the potential for a bullish October, a phenomenon supported by historical data. While investors celebrate this newfound momentum, it’s crucial to examine the underlying factors contributing to this surge, notably the mounting US debt and its impact on Bitcoin’s price. Who's ready for #UptoberFest?#Bitcoin surged by 3% while #Ethereum spiked up to 4.7% within a mere 15-minute timeframe on October 1st, marking the start of #Uptober.Will Uptober live up to its historical reputation though?@giancarloperlas https://t.co/Q0TrXAyx8o Historical data has repeatedly shown that October tends to be a bullish month for cryptocurrencies, except on two occasions since 2013. The start of October this year further fueled the hype for Uptober as Bitcoin and Ethereum, two of the market’s heavyweights, defied recent bearish outlooks, offering traders and “HODLers” a glimmer of hope. Happy Uptober to those who celebrate. Remember 2021? pic.twitter.com/qgHy1ThGOf Bitcoin surged by 3% while Ethereum spiked up to 4.7% within a mere 15-minute timeframe on October 1st. As of 5:00 AM (UTC time) today, BTC is trading above $28,000 while ETH is at $1,725. This triggered a renewed bullish sentiment throughout the market, which resulted in short sellers facing substantial losses. Approximately $70 million in short positions was liquidated within a mere two hours of the event. This unexpected turn has left many pondering the potential catalysts behind this Uptober surge. So far, there are differing explanations as to why Bitcoin tends to move in a bullish direction during Uptober. However, one significant driver behind the crypto market’s recent resurgence may lie in the growing concern over the staggering national debt of the US, which has ballooned to a mind-boggling $33 trillion. This looming financial burden has triggered fears of a “debt death spiral” that could have far-reaching consequences for the nation’s economy. Intriguingly, this could potentially mark a boost for Bitcoin prices according to a report by Forbes. The publication noted that the Federal Reserve has been grappling with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, resorting to a rapid series of interest rate hikes in an attempt to quell runaway inflation. These hikes, the most aggressive since the 2008 global financial crisis, come as the government faces mounting interest payments on its ever-growing debt, with projections indicating a tripling of these costs from just under $400 billion last year to almost $1.2 trillion by 2032. Prominent figures in the cryptocurrency world, such as Max Keiser, have argued that raising interest rates may inadvertently stoke higher inflation, thereby creating a “vicious cycle.” In this scenario, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a potential safe haven for investors seeking refuge from the spiraling debt crisis and the eroding value of fiat currencies. This is where we’re at: The key here being, raising rates won’t stop inflation, it’ll stoke higher inflation. The ‘Vicious Circle’ is unrelenting. We have entered a death debt-spiral. EVERYTHING GOES TO ZERO AGAINST #Bitcoin https://t.co/7Nq0H4UaNk Even JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has cautioned the public to prepare for a “worst-case” Federal Reserve scenario, including the possibility of interest rates as high as 7%. Such a scenario could drive more investors toward assets like Bitcoin, which are less susceptible to inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, Bitcoin trader and former Bitmex CEO Arthur Hayes has also chimed in, suggesting that the Bitcoin price could see further pumps if the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates. According to the investor, rising rates may lead bondholders to seek higher yields in “risk assets” like Bitcoin, potentially driving up demand and prices. As Uptober unfolds, it is clear that the crypto market remains a place of unpredictability and opportunity. The convergence of historical bullish trends in October and the growing concerns surrounding the US debt crisis has ignited a spark in the cryptocurrency world. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have already shown signs of renewed strength, the true potential of Uptober is yet to be fully realized. Investors and traders are closely watching, eager to see whether this month will live up to its historical reputation or if the market has more surprises in store."
2023-10-02 08:00:00+00:00,The SEC Strikes Again With More ETF Delays — Key Details And Developments,https://blockzeit.com/the-sec-strikes-again-with-more-etf-delays-key-details-and-developments/,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again thrown the cryptocurrency and financial markets into uncertainty as it postponed decisions on several spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) applications. The unexpected delays in the SEC’s decisions came approximately two weeks earlier than the initially anticipated second interim deadline, which was originally scheduled for October 16th to 19th.  Analysts and industry experts believe that these preemptive delays are closely linked to the impending US government shutdown, set to commence on October 1st. Okay. Guessing the SEC is done for the night. We're expecting the other 3 #bitcoin ETF delay orders tomorrow before the government shut down. Firms remaining are @WisdomTreeFunds, @vaneck_us, and @Fidelity https://t.co/mS71wsZZDU pic.twitter.com/qcQdBUGEb5 Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed out that the SEC’s move to delay these decisions is likely a proactive measure to navigate the potential challenges posed by the shutdown. Update: Congress was able to pass a short-term funding bill; agencies, programs, and other services will continue operating for now. Ark 21 Shares and VanEck’s applications for Spot Ethereum ETFs have been pushed back until December 25th and 26th respectively.  However, Futures ETFs continue to get approved; Valkyrie’s existing Bitcoin Strategy ETF will expand out to ETH Futures. The fund will change its name on October 3rd to the Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF. The SEC has announced a postponement of the approval decision for the Ark 21 Shares Spot Bitcoin ETF until January 10th, 2024. This extension marks the final deadline for the decision, with the regulatory body seemingly pushing the envelope, given that the original decision date was slated for November 11th. Furthermore, the SEC has similarly delayed decisions on several other Bitcoin ETFs, including those proposed by BlackRock, Invesco, Galaxy Digital, Valkyrie, and GlobalX. These ETFs were initially set for determinations between October 7th and October 19th. This recent round of delays is not the first instance of the SEC pushing back decisions on spot Bitcoin ETFs. In late August, similar delays affected Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, and WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust. The delays have prompted questions about whether the SEC intends to appeal a recent decision. A panel of judges sided with Grayscale and called on the SEC to re-examine its application to transform the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. The SEC has a 45-day window from the August 29th decision to appeal, with October 13th as the final day for such action. While SEC Chair Gary Gensler maintains his stance against cryptocurrencies, steadfast Bitcoin holders continue to hold onto their investments. Glassnode reveals that Bitcoin long-term holdings have reached a historic high, accounting for an impressive 76.09% of the total supply, equivalent to approximately 15 million Bitcoins. As the cryptocurrency industry grapples with regulatory uncertainties, all eyes remain on the SEC for its final verdict on these critical ETF applications. The decisions will not only impact the fate of individual applicants but also have broader implications for the acceptance of cryptocurrencies within traditional finance and the future of the cryptocurrency market as a whole."
2023-09-29 04:52:21+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Consolidates Around The 200-day MA, Leaving Traders Confused About Its Next Move",https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-consolidates-around-the-200-day-ma-leaving-traders-confused-about-its-next-move/,"As Bitcoin (BTC) continues its dance around the crucial 200-day Moving Average (MA), traders worldwide are left pondering on the crypto stalwart’s next big move. Will it rebound powerfully, reinstating its bullish trend, or will it succumb to bearish pressures, tumbling down the price rabbit hole? Stay with us as we delve into the intricacies of this financial riddle, unraveling potential scenarios and providing you with comprehensive market insights that could shape your next trading move. Will Bitcoin surprise us once again? Let’s explore. Bitcoin price rose rather steadily last week the market expected favorable outcome from the FOMC rate announcement. Chairman of the FED, Jerome Powel announced the rates would not be increased or reduced but would be sustained at 5.25%. The market reacted positively to this news, and BTC pushed higher, touching $27,486. However, since then the price has been reducing. Bitcoin is currently trading at $26,947. The 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a key financial indicator popular amongst traders and analysts. It determines long-term market trends, helping to smooth out price fluctuations and reduce the impact of volatile market periods. In the past week, Bitcoin attempted to break above the 200-day EMA (white line) but the bears proved to be much more powerful than the bulls. Bitcoin is currently trying to break and stay above this key indicator, albeit in a tough war. Bitcoin is also in a consolidation pattern that has spanned over one month now. Since the last notable crash on August 23, 2023, BTC has been ranging, occasionally spotting some abnormal spikes and crashes – but within the range. These spikes and crashes, as we have discussed here many times before, are liquidity hunts instigated by the market makers. In short, whenever you see the price of an asset ranging, the market makers are in business. Notable liquidity hunt zones in the past month have been around $25,000 and $28,000. This knowledge presents a certain edge for traders. If you spot a sell-side liquidity hunt (i.e. price breaks sharply out of the range to the downside), then it poises a great buy opportunity. The vice versa is also true. DISCLAIMER: The work included in this article is based on current events, technical charts, company news releases, and the author’s opinions.

2023-09-27 14:00:00+00:00,Chase Bank To Decline Bitcoin and Crypto-Related Payments For Its U.K. Customers,https://blockzeit.com/chase-bank-to-decline-bitcoin-and-crypto-related-payments-for-its-u-k-customers/,"Chase Bank has announced plans to halt Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency-related payments for its UK clientele. While this step is sudden, it is not unexpected. What is suspicious though, is two banks banning crypto within 24 hrs hours. Whether you’re a blockchain enthusiast, a casual investor, or intrigued by the world of digital currencies, this news is sure to draw your attention. BREAKING: Chase Bank to block payments for #Bitcoin and crypto assets. 🧐 pic.twitter.com/GCJl9H3qGO Chase Bank sent out an email to its UK customers stating, “If we think you’re making a payment related to crypto assets, we’ll decline it,”. According to the email, the ban will go into effect on October 16, 2023. While a bank banning or limiting the use of Bitcoin and crypto is not a new thing, Chase Bank, a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank is an influential financial institution. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase Bank has been skeptical of Bitcoin and Crypto for some time now, even going as far as to call the whole industry a fraud. The email sent out to Chase Bank UK customers seems to suggest that the new regulation was prompted by the increase in fraudulent activity using this financial instrument. Moreover, the Bank told its customers they were free to use other banks if they wanted to invest in cryptocurrencies. This move comes just a day shy of Bankwest rolling out eerily similar conditions for its customers. The new conditions affect the Bank’s credit card users. Under the new regulations, the bank will cancel a customer’s account if he or she makes a payment to a cryptocurrency exchange. These recent moves by major banks signal a turning tide in the financial sector’s approach to cryptocurrencies. It’s clear that while digital currencies continue to gain traction globally, traditional financial institutions are grappling with integrating this new technology into their existing frameworks.  While these regulations may present a temporary roadblock for crypto enthusiasts, they also underscore the need for enhanced security measures within the crypto space."

The software company just announced its acquisition of a substantial haul of Bitcoin, further solidifying its position as a heavyweight in the world of institutional crypto investments. The latest purchase, made on September 24, 2023, has seen MicroStrategy acquire a staggering 5,445 Bitcoins, with an investment totaling $147.3 million at an average price of around $27,053 per Bitcoin. MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 5,445 BTC for ~$147.3 million at an average price of $27,053 per #bitcoin.

This colossal stash underscores MicroStrategy’s long-standing commitment to the digital asset as a strategic treasury reserve asset, a philosophy passionately championed by CEO Michael Saylor himself. Saylor’s fervent advocacy for Bitcoin as “digital gold” has been evident throughout MicroStrategy’s journey in the cryptocurrency realm. He has consistently emphasized the significance of the pioneering cryptocurrency as a reliable store of value and a potential hedge against economic uncertainty. The MicroStrategy boss’ faith in Bitcoin has not wavered, and this latest acquisition serves as a resounding testament to his unwavering belief in the cryptocurrency. #Bitcoin Forever. pic.twitter.com/JNZSdXhY32 MicroStrategy’s foray into Bitcoin investments began in August 2020, with its initial purchase marking the start of an impressive accumulation journey. Over time, the company has continued to amass Bitcoin, even resorting to debt financing for some of its acquisitions. Meanwhile, Saylor’s resolute stance on Bitcoin’s value relative to other cryptocurrencies has remained unchanged, with him consistently asserting that altcoins are overvalued and should be divested. ✨ Saylor on #Bitcoin not crypto, exactly 2 years ago. ""Everyone is underestimating $BTC."" 👏 pic.twitter.com/7W6SoT6WpB MicroStrategy’s latest Bitcoin acquisition has profound implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. As one of the most prominent institutional investors in the digital asset, the company’s actions are definitely closely watched by both enthusiasts and skeptics. The immediate aftermath of this purchase has already seen a slight bump in market activity, with BTC prices experiencing a light uptick by around a hundred just an hour after the announcement and as of this writing. How it will play out in the 24-hour chart remains to be seen though. The influx of institutional investment, coupled with MicroStrategy’s unyielding support for Bitcoin, is likely to bolster confidence among retail investors. This renewed interest in Bitcoin could potentially trigger a domino effect, enticing other institutions to consider similar investments. As Bitcoin’s value as a store of value becomes increasingly recognized, it may emerge as an attractive option amid ongoing economic uncertainty. While the cryptocurrency market is notorious for its volatility, MicroStrategy’s substantial Bitcoin holdings and Michael Saylor‘s unwavering advocacy provide a stabilizing influence. As the market continues to evolve, all eyes will be on the company to see how it navigates the ever-changing crypto landscape with its massive BTC treasury. The latest acquisition not only reaffirms MicroStrategy’s commitment to Bitcoin but also highlights the cryptocurrency’s growing importance in the world of finance. Whether or not other institutions will follow Saylor’s footsteps remains to be seen."

This exciting development comes in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain steady rates, shedding light on a unique correlation. Stick around as we unpack this phenomenal rise and what it signifies for the cryptocurrency marketplace. When Templeton filed for their Bitcoin ETF last week, Bitcoin’s price shot up +7.6% steadily over the next couple of days. Bitcoin rose further and is now sitting at $26,632 – a two-week high. However, in the following days, BTC rose even higher and broke the $27,000 mark. Bitcoin still had to clear $28,142 in order to break the lower lows it had been forming on the daily timeframe. Bitcoin rose as high as $27,486, slightly above the 200-day EMA. However, the price got rejected and started coming off its high. The price of BTC currently sits at $26,656. In the past month, BTC has tested the 200-day MA twice and got rejected twice. This is an indicator of weak bulls and may augur a bleak future for this global asset. Additionally, many people are converting their cryptos to Bitcoin, as signaled by the increasing Bitcoin dominance. A rise in this indicator shows the market is fearful and hence, investors are hedging against a potential crash by converting their tokens to BTC. However, this move could be drastic for the market if market makers decide to crash Bitcoin’s price. If BTC Dominance increases and Bitcoin’s price declines, the impact on other cryptocurrencies can be significantly more pronounced. BTC dominance (BTC.D) currently stands at 50.15%. The all-time low BTC.D was in 2018 when it touched 37%. Coincidentally, 2018 was the peak of the bull market. Meanwhile, after a two-day meeting, the Fed announced its federal funds rate would remain in a range of 5.25 to 5.5% – the same level that the central bank announced in July, when it last raised rates. The FED may Shatter the Rate Cut Fantasy This Week https://t.co/wzBZiZbIOL Economic Ninja on X thinks that although the pause in rate hike was expected this week, the Fed may have to resort to increasing the rates in the future as it tries to balance between a hard landing and a smooth transition.

2023-09-21 08:00:00+00:00,Recently Declassified Report Hints At Bitcoin Being An NSA Invention,https://blockzeit.com/recently-declassified-report-hints-at-bitcoin-being-an-nsa-invention/,"In a twist that could shake the foundation of the crypto world, a recently declassified report suggests that Bitcoin, the trailblazer of digital currencies, might be an invention of the National Security Agency (NSA). The NSA invented Bitcoin?1996 paper titled: HOW TO MAKE A MINT: THE CRYPTOGRAPHY OF ANONYMOUS ELECTRONIC CASH*Sources include ""Tatsuaki Okamoto"" 😳Who else would be able to sit anonymously on 1 million coins.Oh, and they invented SHA-256…?https://t.co/QwTVESwOuM pic.twitter.com/cVcbrHOG7a The NSA granted permission to Fried Frank (Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson) LLP, a leading international law firm, to share the report titled “HOW TO MAKE A MINT: THE CRYPTOGRAPHY OF ANONYMOUS ELECTRONIC CASH“. The document delves into the intricate world of electronic cash systems, shedding light on the cryptographic underpinnings and the security features that make them indispensable in today’s digital economy. The research by Laurie Law, Susan Sabett, and Jerry Solinas from the NSA’s Office of Information Security Research and Technology, Cryptology Division represents a significant collaboration between the government and the private sector. It underscores the vital role electronic payment systems play in ensuring secure online transactions, with a primary focus on privacy, authenticity, and nonrepudiation. According to the paper, electronic cash transactions, like Bitcoin’s, encompass three key phases: withdrawal, payment, and deposit, which can happen either online or offline. However, these transactions are not without their vulnerabilities, particularly concerning counterfeiting. Threats such as token forgery and multiple spending demand robust protection mechanisms, including authentication and secure hashing. The report extensively explores cryptographic techniques aimed at fortifying the security of electronic cash systems, with a special emphasis on anonymity and payment untraceability. SHA-256 is a popular cryptographic algorithm for data security. This hashing algorithm is extremely secure as it produces hash values that are irreversible and unique. It is also the encryption algorithm that encrypts Bitcoin blocks on the network that was developed by the NSA. Engineers employed at the agency invested heavily in developing the algorithm, and first published it in 2001 – eight years before Bitcoin came into existence. Read the Bitcoin complete Bitcoin whitepaper. The report explains that electronic cash, similar to Bitcoin, is designed to emulate the characteristics of physical currency, offering portability, recognizability, transferability, untraceability, and most importantly, anonymity, through digital signatures. At its core, public-key cryptography serves as the linchpin of electronic cash systems, where users possess secret keys and public keys for authentication purposes. Another fun fact about this report is that one of the sources included in the list of references is “Tatsuaki Okamoto”, which sounds very similar to the mysterious Bitcoin creator that goes by the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto”. This payment electronic cash system sounds eerily similar to how Bitcoin works. There is no outright statement that connects the NSA to Bitcoin invention. However, the coincidences are too specific to ignore."

In a significant move that underscores the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the world of institutional finance, Nomura Bank’s digital asset subsidiary, Laser Digital Asset Management, has launched a groundbreaking Bitcoin Adoption Fund. JUST IN: 🇯🇵 Japanese investment bank Nomura’s crypto arm Laser Digital has launched a bitcoin fund allowing institutional investors to buy into crypto.“Asia benefitted from what happened in the US and realised the things they need to avoid,” – Fund Co-founder Jez Mohideen pic.twitter.com/zZle3KmQyh This development marks a pivotal moment in the institutional adoption of digital assets and is expected to pave the way for more such offerings in the future. The Bitcoin Adoption Fund, launched by Laser Digital Asset Management, has been specifically designed to cater to the needs of institutional investors. The fund adopts a long-only strategy, offering exclusive exposure to Bitcoin. This approach is aimed at positioning the fund as an economical and secure investment avenue, capitalizing on the growing interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. Nomura’s involvement in this venture adds a layer of credibility to the cryptocurrency market, as the bank is one of Japan’s largest and most respected financial institutions. The move is seen as a testament to the increasing institutional recognition of the potential of cryptocurrencies as an asset class. To ensure the utmost security of the fund’s assets, Laser Digital Asset Management has partnered with Komainu, a digital asset custody solution established in 2018 as a collaborative effort between Nomura, Ledger, and CoinShares. This launch comes on the heels of Laser Digital and Komainu securing operational licenses from Dubai authorities, further solidifying their commitment to operating within a regulated framework. The Bitcoin Adoption Fund operates under the Laser Digital Funds Segregated Portfolio Company (SPC) framework. This framework is designed to shield investors from unnecessary risks, providing an added layer of protection.  The SPC is legally recognized as a mutual fund in the Cayman Islands, offering institutional investors a transparent and regulated investment vehicle for their cryptocurrency exposure. Sebastien Guglietta, Head of Laser Digital Asset Management and former Chief Scientist Officer at Nomura, has been at the forefront of this initiative. He highlights the transformative power of technology in the global economy and underscores Bitcoin’s role as a catalyst for long-term economic change. Fiona King, Head of Distribution at Laser Digital Asset Management, expressed her enthusiasm for the Bitcoin Adoption Fund, emphasizing its role in providing institutional investors with a secure pathway into digital asset investment. King’s extensive experience in institutional finance positions her as a key figure in the successful rollout of the fund. This launch is part of a broader trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. In recent years, institutions have shown increasing interest in Bitcoin and other digital assets as they seek diversified investment opportunities. Notably, Japan’s financial giant, SBI Holdings Inc., launched the country’s first cryptocurrency fund in 2021, reflecting the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within traditional finance. In the United States, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on Bitcoin have gained popularity among accredited investors, offering them a regulated and familiar way to access cryptocurrency markets. While the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency investments continues to evolve, this move by Nomura’s Laser Digital Asset Management demonstrates a strong commitment to providing institutional investors with secure and compliant access to the world of digital assets. As the cryptocurrency market matures, such initiatives are likely to become increasingly commonplace, further bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital economy."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2023-09-17 08:00:00+00:00,Wall Street’s $17.7T Offense Could Shake Up Bitcoin And Ethereum Foundations,https://blockzeit.com/wall-streets-17-7t-offense-could-shake-up-bitcoin-and-ethereum-foundations/,"The cryptocurrency market is in a state of constant flux, with investors navigating a landscape filled with highs and lows. Recent events have sent shockwaves through the industry, raising questions about the future of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other major cryptocurrencies. A Fast-Growing $17.7 Trillion Wall Street #Crypto Earthquake Is Suddenly Hurtling Toward The #Bitcoin And Ethereum Price – Forbes https://t.co/VuVZW70oEH pic.twitter.com/HTsFkSy6NK In recent months, the cryptocurrency market has been far from stable. BTC, ETH, and various altcoins have seen their values fluctuate, leaving investors in a state of uncertainty. In relation to this, Binance’s CEO issued a stark warning about the future of crypto, sending ripples of concern throughout the community. Despite the turbulence, Wall Street behemoths are making significant moves into the cryptocurrency space. With a combined asset management portfolio worth a staggering $17.7 trillion, BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, and WisdomTree have all submitted applications for spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Franklin Templeton, the renowned asset manager overseeing $1.5 trillion in assets, has recently entered the fray by filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) according to Forbes. This move adds momentum to the growing demand for Bitcoin ETF approvals. The Franklin Bitcoin ETF, slated to trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange, seeks to track Bitcoin’s price performance before accounting for fund expenses. The Wall Street giant’s involvement is seen as a powerful show of faith in Bitcoin by one of the world’s leading financial players. Institutional optimism towards Bitcoin ETFs has been further fueled by a court ruling that favored Grayscale’s proposed conversion of its Bitcoin trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF. This decision has reinforced market expectations of an imminent SEC approval. Despite these positive developments, however, the SEC has delayed its decision on most major spot Bitcoin ETF filings until October. While the delay might seem discouraging, it’s essential to remember that regulatory agencies prioritize thorough evaluation. This pause allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the potential implications of cryptocurrency ETFs on the financial market. The cryptocurrency market remains a dynamic and evolving space. Investors should approach it with caution, understanding that its fortunes can change rapidly. While Wall Street’s interest and Franklin Templeton’s filing for a Bitcoin ETF are positive signs, regulatory processes take time. It’s crucial to remain informed and consider diverse investment strategies to navigate the uncertainties of the crypto world. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a newcomer, patience and a long-term perspective will be your allies in this exciting yet unpredictable journey."
2023-09-15 09:30:19+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Inches Upward as Another Huge Asset Management Firm Files For Bitcoin ETF,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-inches-upward-as-another-huge-asset-management-firm-files-for-bitcoin-etf/,"As the sun rises on a new day in the financial world, an unmissable trend is gradually gaining traction. Yet another large asset firm has jumped onto the Bitcoin bandwagon, filing for a Bitcoin ETF, spurring an upward trend in the BTC price, and signaling an exciting time for investors and traders alike.  Amidst the pulsating hum of the global economy, one question prevails – are we on the cusp of a Bitcoin boom? Stay tuned as we delve deeper into these unfolding events. In last week’s analysis, the sharp rejection of Bitcoin after the Grayscale news pump further solidified the bears’ power. Adoption was increasing, but the price was lagging, showing that there might have been an explosive price move to the upside when Market Makers finally stopped suppressing the price. This week, some positive news came in. In an interesting development, Franklin Templeton, a well-established asset management firm, has filed an application for a spot in Bitcoin ETF. This news follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent decision to delay responses to similar applications, including ones from prominent firms like BlackRock and WisdomTree. The SEC has set the next response deadline for October 16, but they retain the power to further delay the decision, if necessary. CPI data for August 2023 also came in at +0.3% and 4.3%, showing that core inflation rose 0.3%. However, the Fed is focusing more on core inflation data since it provides a better indication of where inflation is heading over the long term. The price of Bitcoin on Tuesday rose sharply after hitting a 3-month low of $24,920. The market sentiment for the short-term quickly changed after that as the asset rose +7.6% steadily over the next couple of days. Further news of billion-dollar, Bitcoin rose further and is now sitting at $26,632 – a two-week high. The Bitcoin sell-off that occurred prior to this was due to investor fears of a sell-off from FTX bankruptcy. The court allowed the now infamous crypto exchange to sell off $3.4 billion worth of crypto assets, including WBTC. Brian Amstrong, CEO of U.S-based crypto exchange Coinbase, announced that the exchange would be adding support for the Bitcoin Lightning network. Furthermore, news of PayPal incorporating crypto on/off-ramp functionality on their platform further charged the ensuing Bitcoin rally. Bitcoin is still in a tough spot as it still has to clear $28,142 in order to break the lower lows it has been forming on the daily timeframe. The asset is right at the 200-day EMA, a key indicator that can act as resistance in the current scenario. Bitcoin is not out of the woods yet.

2023-09-12 14:00:00+00:00,Grayscale CEO Believes Bitcoin ETF Approval Is In sight,https://blockzeit.com/grayscale-ceo-believes-bitcoin-etf-approval-is-in-sight/,"Grayscale CEO predicts a Bitcoin ETF approval could be just around the corner. This potentially game-changing news could dramatically alter the BTC price and the overall landscape of cryptocurrency investment. In an interview at CNBC, Michael Sonnenshein said, “If the SEC approves one spot Bitcoin ETF, we expect them to approve them all.” When Grayscale won its case against the SEC, the entire crypto market was aloof with hopes of a Bitcoin ETF being approved. However, the SEC has proved to be stubborn. The court gave the SEC 45 days to appeal the ruling. A Grayscale spokeswoman added that the company was reviewing the details and would pursue “next steps with the SEC.” The court rejected the very basis on which the SEC has been denying Bitcoin ETFs in the past several years. According to the ruling, Bitcoin Futures and Bitcoin ETFs lie in the same regulatory framework, and hence, approving Bitcoin Futures and rejecting Bitcoin ETFs is hypocritical at best. The SEC is now tasked with coming up with a new rationale for arguing their rejection of the Bitcoin ETFs. According to Michael, the SEC has denied Bitcoin ETFs over 15 times in the past several years, leading them to think there is something else causing the SEC to reject the applications. The implication is that if the SEC can’t other reasons for rejecting Bitcoin ETFs besides the ones already rejected by the court, then they will have to approve previously rejected applications. There are currently nine pending Bitcoin ETF applications awaiting approval from the SEC. 45 days (from August 29, 2023) will end on October 13, 2023. Besides this, several firms have also filed their Ethereum ETFs, further exerting pressure on the SEC. Stay tuned as we follow up on this news as it unfolds."

This key indicator is used to show the general market trend and when used in higher time frames, usually overrides technical analysis in the lower timeframes. Let’s dive in and explore Bitcoin price and adoption. On the macro level, the sharp rejection of Bitcoin after the Grayscale news pump further cemented the bears’ power in the current market. There has not been much change on the macro scale in the past week despite wallets with more than 10 bitcoins now at a 3-year high of 157,352. At the same time, the number of Bitcoin addresses (potential holders) with a non-zero balance has exceeded 48.5 million—more than the entire population of Spain. Adoption is increasing, but the price is lagging, showing that there might be an explosive price move to the upside when Market Makers finally stop suppressing the price. Short-term traders in last week’s setup are in profit, though the price is far from hitting the take profit level. This weekend, a potential Short with an RR of 3.26 is available. A 15X leverage could turn a 30% profit quickly. In El Salvador, starting in 2024, Bitcoin education will be coming to every public school, thanks to Mi Primer Bitcoin NGO’s partnership with the Ministry of Education. Such type of adoption sets a foundation for the next generation of global citizens to naturally tend toward digital finance. British Fintech bank ‘Revolut’ with 15M users integrated Bitcoin segwit addresses and on-chain withdraw and receive features. Meanwhile in the U.S.A, 58% of American crypto investors hold Bitcoin, according to a global survey on crypto and web3′ by Consensys and YouGov. Btrust, the Bitcoin non-profit founded by Jack Dorsey and Jay-Z, acquires Qala – the African Bitcoin and Lightning engineering training organization. Not to mention, the financial research firm Bernstein said #Bitcoin is about to experience an unprecedented rally led by institutional investors, after Greyscale’s lawsuit victory against the SEC. To top it off, South Africa’s largest supermarket group, Pick n Pay, is now accepting Bitcoin. While all this happens, Bitcoin pundits estimate that the asset is back below the “Extremely Undervalued” portion of the Rainbow Chart. BitMEX Co-Founder, Arthur Hayes also predicts Bitcoin bull run will accelerate in the next “6 to 12 months. “Whether the Fed raises or cuts, we are in a good position.” DISCLAIMER: The work included in this article is based on current events, technical charts, company news releases, and the author’s opinions.

2023-09-08 06:00:00+00:00,7 Best Wallets That Support Replace-By-Fee (RBF) Fee Bumping For Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/7-best-wallets-that-support-replace-by-fee-rbf-fee-bumping-for-bitcoin/,"Since 2020, Bitcoin transactions have often exceeded available block space. Transaction inclusion in the next block is determined by offered transaction fees. Transactions with inadequate fees wait in the mempool for higher-paying ones to clear. The ability to bump up the transaction fee on a specific transaction helps in rescuing a time-sensitive transaction or as a strategy to pay less in fees. As such, replace-by-fee (RBF) wallets come into play. Replace-By-Fee (RBF) is a node policy that allows an unconfirmed transaction in a mempool to be replaced with a different transaction that spends at least one of the same inputs and pays a higher transaction fee. Various node software implementations employ diverse RBF rules, resulting in multiple variations. The current RBF is the BIP125 opt-in RBF, which enables the transaction originator to indicate their willingness to permit it to be substituted with a higher-paying version. Another alternative RBF variant is full RBF, which permits the replacement of any transaction, regardless of whether it signals BIP125 replaceability. BIP125 requires a replacement transaction to pay a higher feerate (BTC/vbyte) and a higher absolute fee (total BTC). This can make multiparty transactions that want to use RBF vulnerable to transaction pinning attacks. So an occasional discussion topic is proposals to allow RBF to operate solely on a feerate basis. With an increasing number of transactions in the wait, fee bumping will become a bigger deal. Knowing the wallets that support RBF can be of utmost importance. Here are some wallets that support RBF: An exciting discussion ran through the Bitcoin mailing list throughout October of last year. It was about the planned release of Bitcoin Core 24.0 and the “Full RBF” introduced by it. The discussion is technical, but it is manageably complicated. The wallet allows users to set their node forward, even conflicting transactions with higher charges. They can turn off the “first seen” rule. This will also allow transactions to be replaced even if they are not explicitly marked as replaceable, deemed full RBF. Additionally, Core automatically sets the “-walletrbf” option to valid, in that, opt-in RBF is the default. In addition, the wallet has RBF support even in the GUI (where an unconfirmed transaction offers the option to select “increase transaction fee.” Electrum wallet is one of the most popular Bitcoin wallets. With the earliest version of Electrum wallet, developers significantly upgraded to turn off (disable) the RBF option in their wallet. However, with the newest version, RBF is enabled by default option in the wallet. With this change, people will not have to use child-pay-for-parents with more complexity and expensive transaction fees. They will not have to see their transactions stuck in mempools for too long while they cannot do anything. The BlueWallet is a non-custodial, bitcoin-only wallet supporting the Lightning Network. Wallets with this protocol are extremely fast and unbelievably cheap. One can send, receive, and quickly top up their wallet.  One of the most innovative and unique aspects of BlueWallet is its support for batch transactions. This implies that you can bundle up two or more crypto transactions and execute them as a single transaction. The BlueWallet crypto app has also introduced the Replace-By-Fee (RBF) feature that lets you take control of the transaction charges and speeds.  The Trezor wallet is the most trusted way to safely store Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptos. Trezor suite us the new desktop and browser app for Trezor hardware wallets. RBF is on default in Trezor suite. If you disable RBF for a transaction, increasing the fee and low-fee transactions will not be possible. Specter is a desktop wallet interface for Bitcoin Core, focusing on privacy, coin control, and single and multi sig setups. It is a non-custodial wallet and works with all major hardware wallets. This wallet gives you complete control over fees. This means this wallet allows changing the fees after sending using RBF or CPFP. This wallet also provides fee suggestions based on current network conditions so that your transactions are confirmed promptly without paying more than you have to. Sparrow is a Bitcoin wallet for those who value financial self-sovereignty. Sparrow’s emphasis is on security, privacy, and usability. Sparrow also supports RBF. In this case, to perform Replace by Fee (RBF), the transaction must Be in the mempool (not yet confirmed) Have all inputs enabled for RBF (this is the default for transactions sent by Sparrow) Have all inputs from your wallet. Wasabi is an open-source, non-custodial, privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet for Windows, Linux, and Mac. All send transactions signal RBF by default. Using the Speed Up Transaction feature, a pending transaction may be bumped (with RBF). However, to create a replacement transaction would require another wallet. Replace-By-Fee (RBF) wallets have emerged as saviors in congested Bitcoin transactions. Knowing which wallets support RBF is crucial. Other wallets that support RBF include Blockstream Green, Samourai Wallet, NBD’s OBW, Peach, Coinb.in, CoinIO, Nunchunk, Mercury, etc. These wallets empower users to control transaction fees and ensure timely confirmations, offering a lifeline in the turbulent seas of Bitcoin transactions."
2023-09-05 06:00:00+00:00,JP Morgan Anticipates SEC’s Shift On Bitcoin ETFs After Grayscale Case,https://blockzeit.com/jp-morgan-anticipates-secs-shift-on-bitcoin-etfs-after-grayscale-case/,"In a recent turn of events, a federal court has demanded that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revisit its decision regarding Grayscale’s proposal to transform its Bitcoin Trust into an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This legal development has sparked keen interest among market analysts, including those at JP Morgan, who foresee a significant shift in the SEC’s stance on Bitcoin ETFs. The federal court ruled that the SEC’s rejection of Grayscale’s ETF proposal was “arbitrary and capricious.” It found the SEC’s differentiation between futures-based and spot-based Bitcoin ETFs without clear justification troubling. This ruling marks a critical juncture in the ongoing battle for cryptocurrency investment vehicles. It would create a legal precedence that could play in favor of other firms looking to launch their own Bitcoin ETFs. JP Morgan’s analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, have delved into the potential ramifications of this court ruling on the SEC’s stance. Their research suggests that the SEC may be compelled to reevaluate its previous decisions, particularly those related to futures-based Bitcoin ETFs. JP Morgan analysts, spearheaded by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, have forecasted that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will likely be forced to greenlight several spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).https://t.co/LfvYhihgA6 According to CryptoSlate, the analysts speculate that if the SEC reverses its prior approvals of futures-based ETFs, it would likely have to grant approval for Grayscale’s request and other spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Failing to do so could be both disruptive and embarrassing for the regulatory body. For months, the SEC has postponed its verdicts on spot Bitcoin ETF proposals from various firms, including industry giants like BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, and Invesco. This delay could be interpreted as a signal that the SEC is considering simultaneous approvals for multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs, rather than favoring a single applicant. An approval spree for spot Bitcoin ETFs may also usher in increased competition in ETF fees. This could exert pressure on Grayscale to adjust its fees should its trust transform into the world’s largest Bitcoin spot ETF. Despite the optimism surrounding regulatory approvals for spot Bitcoin ETFs, JP Morgan remains cautious about their impact on the broader crypto and financial sectors. The analysts point out that while these ETFs have existed in Canada and Europe for some time, they have not attracted substantial investor interest. The financial institution’s research suggests that the performance of US-launched ETFs may resemble their counterparts in Canada and Europe. Recent months have seen outflows from gold ETFs, but this shift did not translate into gains for Bitcoin funds, including futures-based ETFs. JP Morgan’s forecast is laden with anticipation. The SEC’s ongoing court battle with Grayscale Investments could signal a significant shift in its approach to Bitcoin ETFs. On the other hand, it remains uncertain whether these investment vehicles will truly revolutionize the crypto and financial markets, given the lukewarm reception they have received in other regions."
2023-09-02 08:00:00+00:00,Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Finds New Life in Mesh Networks,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoins-lightning-network-finds-new-life-in-mesh-networks/,"Bitcoin’s Lightning Network goes offline with Bluetooth and WiFi mesh, changing how we transact without the Internet. In a world increasingly dependent on internet connectivity, a Florida-based startup is reshaping the future of cryptocurrency by enabling Bitcoin Lightning Network transactions in offline environments. Known as LNMesh, this pioneering project leverages local mesh networks to facilitate Bitcoin payments without a traditional internet connection. Traditional internet access is only sometimes reliable, especially in remote regions or during natural disasters. This is where LNMesh shines, addressing scenarios where internet access is limited or non-existent. Researchers from Florida International University introduced their groundbreaking concept in a paper titled “LNMesh: Who Said You Need Internet to Send Bitcoin? Offline Lightning Network Payments using Community Wireless Mesh Networks.” Mesh networks operate on a decentralized principle, where devices connect directly to one another via Bluetooth and WiFi, forming a local network independent of the Internet. LNMesh builds upon this concept, establishing a local Lightning Network, a faster and more cost-effective layer built atop the Bitcoin blockchain. LNMesh’s minimal impact on the existing Lightning Network protocol or code sets it apart. The project’s creators established a network of Bitcoin and Lightning nodes using low-cost Raspberry Pi computers. Moreover, these nodes, strategically placed across their university campus, were interconnected via Bluetooth and WiFi through a local mesh network. LNMesh’s experiments demonstrated that Lightning payments could be successfully sent between nodes in an offline environment. Since Lightning payments are off-chain and not reliant on the Bitcoin blockchain, they can be settled offline. However, challenges still need to be addressed, particularly in efficiently coordinating the opening of channels between users. LNMesh explores innovative methods to analyze users’ daily mobility patterns, determining the most strategic channels to open. While progress has been made, further automation of this coordination process is essential for practical use. Despite these challenges, LNMesh’s breakthrough holds tremendous promise, offering a lifeline for those who rely on digital currency when the digital world goes offline. Moreover, the startup’s commitment to open-source development means its code and research findings are available for others to explore and build upon. The marriage of Bitcoin’s Lightning Network with mesh networks through LNMesh represents a transformative step towards a future where cryptocurrencies can thrive in offline environments. As LNMesh continues to evolve, the potential for decentralized offline payments becomes increasingly tangible, making cryptocurrency a resilient option even in the most challenging circumstances."

The Bitcoin price, in a surprising display of volatility, has seen a rapid reversion, completely obliterating the gains that had earlier ushered in a wave of investor optimism. As the crypto world watches with bated breath, the question remains – Where does Bitcoin go from here? This story unfolds as we delve deeper into this fascinating roller-coaster of cryptocurrency trading. Stay tuned. Bitcoin had formed a bearish flag, a bearish chart pattern indicating a potential continuation of a downtrend, and was anticipating a further decline. The short-term call from the previous week had proven to be a massive success. However, this week some good news disrupted our previous analysis. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust managed to score one over the SEC in court and was given the leeway to launch its own Bitcoin ETF. On the announcement of the decision, Bitcoin shot up by +6% and touched a local high of $28,152, invalidating the bearish flag that was almost maturing up. After about a week of ranging, the asset broke out and is now testing the 200-day moving average on the Daily TF. Sadly, after the hype had died down, BTC retraced back to its previous price over a span of three days, wiping off all the profits made in the price spike. The price is back in the 25.5k – 26.5k range, giving day traders the chance to make profits scalping the range. On the macro scale, Bitcoin only managed to test the 200-day MA and got rejected sharply, indicating that bears are still in absolute power. The rally-up can be seen as a move by the market makers to liquidate the Sell Stops that had been building for three weeks at the 26.5k level. The current Bitcoin chart should have traders worried and cautious. Bitcoin is back in its previous position of no major support (at least until $20k). For short-term traders, the previous three days’ price action has created a supply zone at the $27,300 level. Currently, the price of BTC sits at $25,994. Smart Money may want to drive the price up to this price to hunt the liquidity sitting there. With 10X leverage, the +5% move could turn a +50% profit in 2-3 days.

2023-08-25 07:43:39+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Firmly In Danger Zone As BRICS Summit Kicks Off In South Africa,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-firmly-in-danger-zone-as-brics-summit-kicks-off-in-south-africa/,"As the BRICS Summit unfolds in South Africa, the cryptocurrency market is surging with uncertainty, with Bitcoin precariously teetering on the brink of the ‘danger zone’. The digital currency’s value is fluctuating wildly, raising questions about its stability and leaving investors and spectators alike on tenterhooks. Will Bitcoin pull through, or will this be the undoing of the world’s pre-eminent digital asset? Stay tuned as we unravel the cryptic world of cryptocurrencies. In last week’s analysis, Bitcoin broke down from the ascending triangle, although it still remained above the 200-day moving average. However, over the next few days, the asset sharply crashed below this key indicator. Currently, BTC is trading way below the 50 and 200-day EMA, posing a very real danger of a crash. All this happens in the backdrop of the much anticipated BRICS summit in South Africa. The BRICS meeting is expected to conclude with decisions that will shake the global financial and political spheres Since the price is now 3.84% below the 200-day EMA, traders need to tread carefully. The next major support for Bitcoin sits at $20,000, but if bears persist, the price could fall to $15,000. Traders who have patience can Short 10X here and make a handsome +230% profit in the short to medium term. On the daily, Bitcoin is forming a bearish flag, a bearish chart pattern signifying a potential continuation of a downtrend. This pattern is named as such due to its resemblance to a flag on a pole when visualized on a chart. Traders often interpret the breakout from this consolidation phase, as the price drops below the ‘flag’, as a signal to enter a short position, anticipating a further decline. Last week’s short-term call was a massive success. Called it (again) $BTC on@BlockzeitE pic.twitter.com/gHr3s2fkgI The BRICS nations have now officially resolved to abandon the US dollar as a medium of exchange for trade settlements between member nations, thus furthering the de-dollarization initiative. It is expected that other nations will soon follow suit. This was a much-anticipated decision since rumors of the BRICS alliance planning the de-dollarization of the global economy had become mainstream news. The alliance presents a formidable enemy to the U.S. and the G20 nations. As of August 24, 2023, BRICS controlled 80% of global oil production after UAE, Iran, and Saudi Arabia joined the alliance. The main motivation for this move was to protect their interests from U.S. sanctions and create a more equitable global economic system.

2023-08-24 15:31:34+00:00,Bitcoin Is Here to Stay – 10 Industries Benefitting from Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-is-here-to-stay-10-industries-benefitting-from-bitcoin/,"Crypto has been a hot topic in the past couple of years. And its biggest star is naturally Bitcoin, the main attraction and most recognizable currency in the world of crypto. People from all around the world were interested in the stories of mining it, and what is it exactly. Bitcoin in its essence represents a form of payment, it is a virtual currency that people use as money with all its benefits. Bitcoin is under no one’s control, not one man, group, or corporation, and in that way, it represents an open-source peer-to-peer (P2P) technology. Nobody is its owner, and everyone can be its user. Those and many more attractions that Bitcoin offers, make it appealing to various industries that implement it in their business. The following are the ones that benefit from this globally recognized cryptocurrency. The gambling industry is currently one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. Data shows it is recording impressive numbers. It took over all the biggest world markets and represents one of the most popular pass times in the world. Cryptocurrency casinos were a factor in that, naturally. A list of the best bitcoin casinos in Malaysia can be found in this helpful guide. And you will want to check them out, as their offer is a unique one. Websites for gambling attracted so many people due to their easy approach and excellent user experience. The collaboration between Bitcoin and online casinos represents a natural one, and here are the reasons for that. The collaboration between Bitcoins and online casinos, as Spock from Star Trek would say, is only logical. That cooperation created so-called Cryptocurrency casinos, specialized online casinos that accept only cryptocurrencies as payment methods. They do so because of the benefits for both players and casino owners, which are numerous. Bitcoin payments in this type of casino provide players with increased anonymity and in that way protect their personal information. Due to that, the security of the players is strengthened. And with the directness of transactions between casinos and gamblers, transactions are much faster, and the fees are significantly lower. A large number of big companies, that are recognized as eCommerce giants, such as Home Depot for example, recognized the appearance of Bitcoin as a payment method and quickly established it as a legitimate payment option. These companies either included it on their websites or allowed it through third-party services. As online shopping is appealing to younger generations, it was a perfect fit for these industries as Bitcoin payments were accepted by the same group of consumers. Even some transaction companies included Bitcoin as a payment option and act as a Bitcoin collection service for eCommerce companies. As the banking systems displayed their imperfection in various global financial crises, financial institutions incorporated Bitcoin as their service offering. Banks are now allowing their users to store their cryptographic keys in their accounts. Even nations are allowing Bitcoin as payments for state and public services, with rumors that Liechtenstein will soon follow the Switzerlands example. When a globally recognized financial investment company such as J.P. Morgan integrates Bitcoin as a payment method, we can expect others to follow very soon. The expansion of streaming platforms is also present, as Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, and many, many more are fighting for viewers. The content they offer is excellent, but it is not only about content. Since the viewers are all around the world, Bitcoin is perfect as a universal payment method for all of them. And as we mentioned in the digital commerce section, these are the services for the younger audience, which is already interested in paying with Bitcoin. Some of the globally recognized medical institutions started to accept Bitcoin as a payment method from their patients for medical services. For example, one of the planetary popular medical services is in South Korea, as their hospital in Seoul allowed Bitcoin payments using digital wallets. It is easy for patients to pay their medical bills with a simple click on their phone. One of the industries that was hugely impacted by the coronavirus crisis is this one. People were not allowed to travel, and the impact was enormous. Hotels were empty, flights were grounded, and attractions missed their visitors. That is why when things got back to normal, they used any means necessary to attract their customers back. That is why today, you can book all these things online with Bitcoin. As we mentioned the ease with which customers can pay with Bitcoin, it is no wonder that the companies from this industry accepted it as payment. Famous shops like Starbucks or Burger King already incorporated it into payment methods, but the main business that pushed Bitcoin payments is food delivery service. Uber Eats, Just Eat, and others found it easier to collect the payment in this way, and the customers were overjoyed. The gaming industry was always popular, but the advancement of mobile gaming development created an unprecedented mania with customers. We all remember a certain game addiction, like Candy Crush or Flappy Bird for example, which used micropayments to extract money from players. By some research, mobile gaming attracted more than 3 billion active players by now, and all those games offered add-ons.  In some cases special weapons, upgrades for armor or vehicle, even directly increasing the rank of their avatar for money. The companies from this industry accepted Bitcoin very fast for that type of transaction. When we are talking about raising money for charity, we can all agree that every means to accumulate funds should be implemented. No matter if the subject of the charity is a disease, natural disaster, or anything else. People should be allowed to help the less fortunate ones. That is why many worldly renowned organizations like Red Cross, UNICEF, and others accepted Bitcoin as a method to contribute. People are investing a lot in self-education. And that is notable, same as the behavior of colleges that accepted Bitcoin as a payment method. Several US colleges have declared that they want to help their students with paying for educating themselves in those institutions. By using the already explained benefit of Bitcoin, students will save up to 3 percent in transaction fees if they pay in this way. This represents a way to help young people. Even though unfamiliar to some, Bitcoin represents a globally recognized currency, much like the US dollar or Euro. With technological advancements improving our lives every day, why shouldn’t it be easier for us to pay more easily? When you add other benefits that Bitcoin offers such as smaller fees, faster transactions, and anonymity, you don’t need to be an expert to see, Bitcoin is here to stay. And we should inform ourselves to make the most of it."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."

2023-08-18 07:54:20+00:00,Market Wrap: Warning Signs As Bitcoin Breaks Down From A 6-month Uptrend,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-warning-signs-as-bitcoin-breaks-down-from-a-6-month-uptrend/,"In an unexpected twist, the Bitcoin juggernaut has hit a speed bump. The once seemingly unstoppable cryptocurrency has taken a break from its six-month uphill climb. The sudden downturn has sent tremors across the financial markets, with investors and enthusiasts alike waiting with bated breath. Is this just a simple market correction or a warning sign of an upcoming crypto winter? The next few days will answer these burning questions. Let’s dive in and analyze the charts. Last week’s analysis saw Bitcoin still trending inside the 6-month ascending triangle. The initial prediction was that the price would follow the generally accepted outcome of ascending triangle chart patterns – Bullish. However, a Bitcoin sell-off triggered on August 17 caused the asset to slip below the lower trendline of the ascending triangle. If the daily candle for August 17 closes below this trendline, investors should get concerned since it would be an indicator of red markets in the future. Bitcoin is currently trading at $26,444 as at the time of writing (August 18, 2023 07:32 AM UTC). Despite the asset breaking down from the ascending triangle, Bitcoin is still trending above the 200-day moving average. Over the last three days, the asset has droped -10.73%, effectively going below the 50-day moving average. Since the Golden Cross in early February 2023, the price has been testing the 200-day moving average, trying to break through to the downside. However, it has not been able to. In early March, there was a quick V-shaped false break out that left a lot of Shorts liquidated. Since February, the price has tested the 200-day MA twice, with this recent one being the third one. Bitcoin bears on August 17 managed to force the price to close below this macro-indicator. The last time it did this there was an immediate reversal as mentioned previously. This time around the general market sentiment is bearish and Bitcoin may drop to $25k, and in a worst-case scenario, to $21k. For the short-term traders, last week’s call was a success, although it took three days to hit the target. In the coming week, traders should expect the downward trend to continue. Bitcoin price already broke through a previous weak support (which may become a resistance in the future). Bulls may be expected to try and push the price back up and test $28,000 – $28,500.  However, the power of the bears is currently stronger. Bitcoin is looking at a -9% drop from the current price over the next few days. This will leave it sitting at $25,000. A 10X Short could yield +90% profit on this potential setup.

In the chart from the previous week, BTC was expected to touch the lower up-trending line before testing the ceiling of the ascending triangle. There would have been no more room for consolidation in a few days, and Bitcoin had to make a decision. On Monday, August 7, 2023, BTC began its slow ascent up from a local low of $28,671. Over the next 24 hrs, the asset rallied to a high of $30,210 where it met with a zone of high supply and sell pressure. Smart Money hunted the liquidity at this zone and liquidated several hundred million dollars worth of Shorts, before pushing the price down. The price of Bitcoin currently sits at $29,406 (Friday, August 11, 2023, 5:52 AM UTC). This price action which began on the very first day of August sent BTC into a consolidation phase. Depending on which side BTC breaks out of this range, it can either test $31,150 or $28,100. If it tests the upper side of the ascending triangle, it might get rejected and still return to the $29k range. However, if it breaks through, the sky’s the limit for BTC. If the price breaks down to $28k from this range, then we expect a bounce from the up-trend line and a rally toward the $31,150 level. If for some reason (like a black swan event) BTC fails to hold the up-trend line, it would spell doom for the entire crypto market because the asset could easily fall to $15,000. CPI data dropped yesterday at 3.2%, lower than expected. The market reacted positively, and Bitcoin even rose a little (+0.81%) from $29,464 to $29,705. However, these gains were quickly erased as the asset plummeted sharply within the next hour as investors rushed to sell the news. For the short-term traders, last week’s call was a success, although it took three days to hit the target. This week, investors might want to Short BTC (with safe leverage) from the current price to around $28,600. This is a 50.54% profit using 25X leverage. It’s important to remember that all crypto prices are highly unpredictable and volatile. So, while some traders may do well by chasing price movements, others could find themselves with deep losses.

These hackers, subjected to sanctions by the United States Treasury Department, have long exploited cryptocurrencies for their illicit activities. 🔥🔥🔥A court just entered final judgment in a federal lawsuit and the court used @JuratNetwork to enforce its order on-chain!The judge enjoined Russian and North Korean hackers from accessing their accounts, making $JTC the first cryptocurrency to comply with @USTreasury… Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) have, for years, facilitated cybercrime endeavors, especially in the realm of ransomware. However, this case marks a monumental shift by utilizing inventive blockchain technology to effectively freeze cybercriminals out of their blockchain-based accounts according to a new press release. At the forefront of this legal breakthrough is Jurat Blockchains, an emerging tech firm specializing in the integration of legal enforcement mechanisms within blockchain systems. The CEO of the firm, Mike Kanovitz, lauds the technology’s potential to rectify the tarnished reputation of cryptocurrencies while aiding authorities in preventing and addressing cybercrimes. The federal court’s actions target a group of 16 individuals and criminal organizations hailing from Russia and North Korea, all of whom face sanctions imposed by the United States Treasury Department. Among the notable entities are Hydra Market and the Lazarus Group, both of which have engaged in high-profile cybercrimes, including virtual currency heists and money laundering. In an unprecedented move, the court has placed a freeze on the cryptocurrency holdings of these 16 criminals, specifically those involving the novel digital coin, $JTC. This cryptocurrency emerged as a result of a software update to Bitcoin (BTC), leading to the creation of a new blockchain, BTC and JTC. Victims who have previously suffered losses due to cybercrimes can seek recourse by claiming their assets through the innovative Jurat Wallet app or by pursuing legal action. Estimates suggest that cryptocurrency-related crimes amass losses exceeding $20 billion annually, making this courtroom success a significant step towards curbing cybercriminal activities in the digital realm. By enabling victims to reclaim their stolen assets and by locking out cybercriminals from their ill-gotten gains, blockchain technology showcases its potential to revolutionize the fight against virtual heists and fraud. Leading the charge in this ground-breaking legal endeavor is Jon Loevy, a seasoned attorney from Loevy & Loevy Attorneys at Law based in Chicago. His strategic and determined approach has paved the way for the successful integration of blockchain technology in the realm of jurisprudence. Jurat Blockchains, a trailblazing tech entity, offers a glimpse into the future of legal technology within blockchain systems. Since its launch, Jurat Blockchains has expanded its portfolio to include diverse layer 1 projects and dispute resolution system dApps, solidifying its position as a driving force in the convergence of law and technology."
2023-08-07 06:00:00+00:00,"Tether Surpasses Q2 Expectations, Company Is Now 11th Largest Bitcoin Hoarder",https://blockzeit.com/tether-surpasses-q2-expectations-company-is-now-11th-largest-bitcoin-hoarder/,"The recent attestation report of Tether for the second quarter of 2023 has revealed surprising developments for the company behind the USDT stablecoin. Known for its commitment to maintaining a stable token, Tether’s excess reserves have witnessed substantial growth, reaching an impressive $3.3 billion. This accumulation also positioned Tether as the 11th largest Bitcoin holder globally, with its BTC holdings now valued at approximately $1.676 billion (around 55,022 BTC). Tether’s commitment to preserving the stability of its USDT stablecoin has driven the accumulation of substantial excess reserves. By retaining profits and not distributing them as dividends, the company has amassed an impressive $3.3 billion in excess reserves during Q2 2023. This prudent approach allows Tether to maintain 100% reserves to back all USDT in circulation, ensuring the token’s stability. One intriguing aspect of Tether’s financial report is the revelation of its Bitcoin holdings, which increased by 1,529 BTC for the price of $45.4 during the date of purchase. With previous estimates suggesting that the company held more than $1.5 billion worth of BTC (around 53,495 BTC) in its reserves, the latest report showcases an increase of over $176 million. This growth indicates Tether’s dedication to its initial investment plans, which included allocating 15% of future profits to Bitcoin. The research analyst at 21.co, Tom Wan, made an interesting discovery in the previous quarter, suggesting that Tether might be holding all its Bitcoin in a single wallet. This finding made the company the 12th largest BTC holder at that time. 1/ .@Tether_to BTC balance increased by $176M compared to last q– Using the price as of 30 Jun, it is estimated that they hold ~55,022 BTC– Last Q, I mentioned the below address could belong to Tether:bc1qjasf9z3h7w3jspkhtgatgpyvvzgpa2wwd2lr0eh5tx44reyn2k7sfc27a4 pic.twitter.com/90DGmqQvLS Subsequent to Q2 2023, the analyst’s speculations have been confirmed, with Tether’s reported BTC holdings aligning perfectly with the balance of a singular Bitcoin address. This address, suspected to belong to Tether, now ranks as the 11th largest Bitcoin holder globally. Tether’s proactive stance towards investing in Bitcoin stems from its unwavering confidence in the cryptocurrency’s resilience and potential as a valuable investment asset. The company’s CTO, Paolo Ardoino, a vocal supporter of Bitcoin, attributes the decision to the digital currency’s limited supply, decentralized nature, and widespread adoption. He highlights the digital asset’s status as a long-term store of value, making it an attractive choice for both institutional and retail investors. SCOOP: Tether Bought 1,529 #Bitcoin in Q2By @namcios Tether, the company behind the world’s most popular stablecoin $USDT, acquired 1,529 bitcoin in the second quarter of 2023.Different numbers on Tether’s Q2 purchase have floated online. Paolo Ardoino, the company’s CTO,… pic.twitter.com/Px31nEBNYW While Tether’s significant Bitcoin holdings indicate the company’s belief in the cryptocurrency’s potential, it has also sparked concerns regarding exposure to the inherent volatility of the asset. The value of Bitcoin can fluctuate dramatically, and this heightened investment in a volatile asset could expose Tether and USDT to potential risks. Tether’s latest financial report for Q2 2023 has solidified its position as a major player in the cryptocurrency market. With $3.3 billion in excess reserves and its Bitcoin holdings now surpassing $1.676 billion, the company has demonstrated its dedication to maintaining a stable and trustworthy USDT stablecoin. However, Tether’s concentration on Bitcoin investment also presents risks that warrant careful consideration. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, Tether’s strategic choices will undoubtedly influence the market’s future direction."
2023-08-04 12:00:00+00:00,Margot Robbie Called Bitcoin A Ken As Mattel Explores NFTs,https://blockzeit.com/margot-robbie-called-bitcoin-a-ken-as-mattel-explores-nfts/,"Margot Robbie pokes fun at Bitcoin’s male-centric image while promoting ‘Barbie’ as Mattel delves into NFTs, reshaping the toy world. Margot Robbie, the lead actress in this summer’s blockbuster phenomenon “Barbie,” made fun of the bitcoin industry, in a recent interview. Hollywood star Robbie, born in Australia, revealed that she and director Greta Gerwig were frequently amused by the cryptocurrency discussions of two of the movie’s male producers, David Heyman and Tom Acklerley, who also happens to be Robbie’s husband. Robbie and Gerwig made a hilarious parallel between the creators’ discussions about Bitcoin and the stereotypically male actions displayed by the character “Ken” in the “Barbie” movie. The abbreviation “Ken” has become widely used on social media to denote comically vain, confident, or patriarchal conduct. Interestingly enough, Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of the software firm MicroStrategy, seized the chance to associate the phrase “Big Ken Energy” with Bitcoin. Saylor may have amusingly embraced the fun parody when he tweeted a video of Robbie’s interview with the caption, “Bitcoin is Big Ken Energy.” While Mattel, the parent company of “Barbie,” has expressed significant support for blockchain technology as a possible revenue stream for its brands, Margot Robbie may view Bitcoin as a “Ken” thing. Mattel is updating Barbie to keep up with contemporary culture. Before that, Mattel made a substantial foray into the NFT space by launching themed NFTs based on Barbie in association with the female-led crypto media brand Boss Beauties. The goal of the Barbie film was to encourage women and collectors to learn more about Web3 by purchasing blockchain-powered toys. Beyond NFTs, Mattel is also interested in blockchain technology. The business introduced a marketplace on the Flow blockchain earlier this year, enabling users to trade Mattel NFTs directly with one another and earn bitcoin.  The corporation has excellent intentions for its presence in the developing technology scene, as evidenced by its dedication to blockchain. Margot Robbie’s creative interpretation of Bitcoin and its connection to “Big Ken Energy” offers a lighthearted touch to the ongoing cryptocurrency discussion while “Barbie” maintains its grip on audiences everywhere.  The partnership between the movie and the blockchain and NFT market highlights the growing overlap between entertainment and decentralized technology and signals the beginning of an exciting period of innovation and creativity in the sector. Robbie’s lighthearted jest highlights the broader appeal of cryptocurrencies, even if perceived with playful skepticism. Meanwhile, Mattel’s blockchain endeavors signify a progressive leap into embracing technology, bridging the realms of entertainment and innovation."
2023-08-04 06:40:36+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Consolidates As MicroStrategy Adds More BTC To Their Stash,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-consolidates-as-microstrategy-adds-more-btc-to-their-stash/,"Bitcoin price has been consolidating over the past few days despite market conditions remaining favorable for a bull market. Meanwhile, Microstrategy Inc. has added another 467 BTC to their stash, worth about $14.4 million.  So, what’s next on the Bitcoin horizon? While no one can predict the market with 100% accuracy, many analysts believe that MicroStrategy’s continued investment could lead to a bullish market in the future. In last week’s analysis, an ascending triangle revealed itself in the daily chart. The chart pattern puts hope in the hearts of investors that Bitcoin is on the right path for a bullish breakout. However, it is important to note that these chart patterns are based on probability. It could very well break to the downside – albeit on rare occasions. One rare occasion that could turn this nice setup into an investor’s worst nightmare is a black swan event. Donald J. Trump just landed at Reagan National Airport in Washington D.C to be arraigned in court for the January 6th alleged insurrection. While this may seem purely political, it has deep implications on the crypto market and Bitcoin. Since his first presidential run, Trump has always been associated with green markets for the crypto space. In 2016, before he secured his win, financial pundits equated his win with bullish crypto markets. Indeed, when Trump won the elections, virtual currencies like Bitcoin saw gains. Nothing has changed. If he wins now, his victory will be manifested in the price of Bitcoin. In the eye of the storm of uncertainty, one company stands firm – MicroStrategy. Swimming against the current, the business intelligence firm has made bold moves to increase its Bitcoin holdings. This past week, the company purchased an additional 467 Bitcoins for approximately $14.4 million.  MicroStrategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, has shown unwavering faith in Bitcoin. His conviction is so strong, in fact, that the firm now holds over 120,000 Bitcoins in its treasury. When a whale like MicroStrategy invests heavily in Bitcoin, it sends a clear signal to the market: confidence is high. This can have a far-reaching impact on the market, potentially driving the price up. Little has changed in the chart since last week since BTC has been consolidating. However, given the pattern structure, BTC should touch the lower up-trending line before it can test the ceiling of this ascending triangle. There will be no more room for consolidation in a few days, and Bitcoin must decide. This means that next week should be an interesting week. August is a significant month, and we might experience several black swan events this month and September. The BRICS alliance has been growing rapidly, Operation Sandman is complete, and the U.S. de-dollarization plan is still underway. All these things coincide with Bitcoin reaching the end of this huge 7-month chart pattern. Additionally, they also coincide with Trump’s arraignment. When they pull the plug, there won’t be time to react. For short-term traders, there are Supply and Demand zones around $30,000 and $28,700, respectively. The price already tested the Demand zone and might look to test the Supply zone now. From the current price to the Supply zone is about a +2.2% gain. Using the right leverage, this can turn a nice profit. DISCLAIMER: The work included in this article is based on current events, technical charts, company news releases, and the author’s opinions.

2023-07-31 07:57:26+00:00,Just-In: Coinbase CEO Reveals All Crypto Except Bitcoin Are Considered Securities By SEC,https://blockzeit.com/just-in-coinbase-ceo-reveals-all-crypto-except-bitcoin-are-considered-securities-by-sec/,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong just revealed details about a crucial exchange involving his company and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In his exposé, the regulatory agency allegedly declared that all crypto assets, with the exception of Bitcoin, should be classified as securities. This contentious statement has ignited a legal battle between the crypto exchange and the SEC, raising questions about the potential implications for the broader cryptocurrency community. https://t.co/9E5ryOwvWi In an interview with the Financial Times, Armstrong disclosed the SEC’s stance, claiming that they approached Coinbase and quoted them as saying, “We believe every asset other than Bitcoin is a security.” This announcement was supposedly made prior to the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase, which came in June. As a result, Coinbase immediately contested the regulatory agency’s classification, asserting that their understanding of the law differed. When seeking clarification on the basis for this “security” classification, the SEC refused to elaborate further. Instead, the government watchdog directed Coinbase to delist all assets apart from Bitcoin. This decision presented a dilemma for the exchange, as compliance would have set a precedent that many other American crypto businesses were operating unlawfully unless they registered with the commission. Armstrong revealed that compliance with the SEC’s directive to delist all assets, excluding Bitcoin, would have been catastrophic for the crypto industry in the United States. Most businesses would have been deemed non-compliant, jeopardizing their operations. Consequently, Coinbase found itself at a crossroads, faced with a critical decision that could shape the future of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Given the gravity of the situation, Coinbase took a bold step to seek clarity through legal means. Filing a lawsuit against the SEC in April, the exchange requested a simple “yes” or “no” response to 50 specific concerns regarding the regulation of digital assets and the basis for their classification. However, the SEC’s recent ruling in the SEC-Ripple case provided some semblance of clarity for the crypto industry. The revelation of the SEC’s stance has triggered a wave of speculation and concern among crypto enthusiasts, investors, and industry players alike. The potential reclassification of various cryptocurrencies as securities could introduce stringent regulatory requirements, hindering innovation and stifling market growth. This revelation has brought into question the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and the need for clear guidelines from governing bodies. The uncertainty surrounding the regulatory status of crypto assets, if deemed securities, could significantly impact investor confidence and lead to increased market volatility. Investors may become more cautious, leading to potential market contractions as they reassess their risk exposure. This recent revelation by the Coinbase CEO highlights the urgent need for regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency space. Ambiguity surrounding the classification of assets creates challenges for businesses, investors, and regulatory authorities alike. To foster a thriving and sustainable crypto ecosystem, industry stakeholders require transparent and well-defined regulations."
2023-07-28 08:29:02+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Inches Nearer To A Bullish Breakout,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-inches-nearer-to-a-bullish-breakout/,"Bitcoin price has been steadily ranging this past week. However, looking at the Daily chart, BTC is on an uptrend. Can it sustain this trend or will there be a pullback this coming week? Let’s find out Last week Bitcoin took a sharp nosedive from the $31,000 mark after the United States dumped 8200 BTC on the market. Nevertheless, the dump was insignificant in the greater scheme of things since Bitcoin was still in an uptrend. While the price of Bitcoin has remained in consolidation for the most part of the week, it still has been trading above its 50-day moving average. Additionally, the recent dip to $29,000 was quickly bought up by investors, indicating strong support at lower levels. A gigantic ascending triangle has been forming over the past six months and is almost nearing its end. Ascending triangles can indicate a potential breakout to the upside. They are formed by a horizontal resistance level and a rising trendline. As the price approaches the resistance level, it may bounce off it multiple times, creating a series of higher lows. This results in a triangle shape that points upwards, hence the name ascending triangle. Traders look for a breakout above the resistance level as an indication of a potential bullish move. The breakout should be accompanied by high trading volume to confirm the validity of the pattern. The target price for the breakout is usually calculated by measuring the distance between the highest and lowest points of the triangle and adding it to the breakout point. This puts the price of Bitcoin at around $46,000 to $48,000 in four to five months. Overall, while there are some positive signs for a potential bullish breakout, it is important to keep in mind that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and unpredictable. Therefore, it is crucial to closely monitor market trends and news developments to make informed decisions.

2023-07-21 08:30:10+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Drops Below $30,000 As The U.S Government Sells Another 8,200 BTC Seized From Silk Road",https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-price-drops-below-30000-as-the-u-s-government-sells-another-8200-btc-seized-from-silk-road/,"The U.S. just dumped 8,200 BTC, looted from a raid on Silk Road. As of July 21, 2023, the U.S. government has 195,307 BTC left in their possession, available to be dumped at any time on the unsuspecting market. The dump caused the Bitcoin price to go down sharply, bringing down with it the majority of the altcoins Despite this news, Bitcoin managed to hold off the crash, preventing a cascade effect. Blackrock is still bullish on Bitcoin and the first Bitcoin spot ETF has never been closer to acceptance than now.  Besides this, all eyes in the space are eyeing the Bitcoin halving, which is just 260 days (less than a year) away.  In last week’s analysis, Judge Torres’ news liberating Ripple (XRP) from the 3-year-long lawsuit resulted in a substantial price rally. However, this run-up resulted in the formation of new Demand and supply zones in the short term, and soon after, the price came back down – MM had to collect that sweet liquidity. On the Daily chart, Bitcoin is trying to break out of range. However, from the look of things, the range only just began and the asset might be stuck here for the next couple of weeks. The supply zone is an area on an asset’s price chart where there is huge liquidity of sell orders. Market makers like these areas because they can snatch this liquidity from traders and into their own pockets. The first run-up established the supply zone by causing many Shorting retail traders to set their stops at this region. Some traders who are bullish on Bitcoin are also waiting for the asset to reach this point (and break out) for them to enter long positions. On the flip side, the move to the downside established a demand zone to trap traders who are long on BTC and have set their stops at this level. Therefore in the coming weeks, BTC might drop to around 24K – 25K area. For short-term traders, the previous BTC fall on July 20 may have created a new Supply Zone and Demand Zone in the 15-minute chart. Subsequently, we find ourselves with a nice opportunity to bag 30% – 60% profit in the short term (using 25x Leverage).

2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."

The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."

2023-07-14 06:01:42+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Shoots Past $31,000 As XRP Scores a Win Against the SEC",https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-shoots-past-31000-as-xrp-scores-a-win-against-the-sec/,"Bitcoin price soared past $31,000 after XRP scored a massive win against the SEC. Seems like the 13th and 14th of every month has something to offer the crypto world – whether good or bad.  The crypto community was full of activity on June 13, 2023, at 15:00 PM UTC, when Judge Analisa Torres delivered a summary verdict on the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit. The price of XRP shot up over 50% hours after the judgment was delivered. Other tokens and coins followed suit, and BTC was not left behind, rising 4.5% in 3 hours. In last week’s analysis, we put out two theories for Bitcoin’s future movement. While the XRP case win is good for the industry, we are afraid its impact on BTC was less than satisfactory. This is evidence of heavy price manipulation. We theorized that BTC had two possible fates: Bearish or Bullish. Each of those fates depended heavily on the Market Makers’ mood. It seems the market is following the bullish route, though not exactly. Smart money can’t be seen to be actively and clearly manipulating the price of Bitcoin. Therefore, they have to let the price of BTC rise a bit on this news, but not too much. This can be seen in this week’s charts where BTC’s price rise was peanuts and less than expected with this kind of market-impacting news. This is a daily chart for Bitcoin and it shows an interesting formation. The end of the downtrend which was followed by an impulse move of consecutive green candles marks a supply zone. This means that many retail traders have set their stop-loss orders at this zone and Smart Money must drive the price down eventually to hunt this liquidity before resuming the upwards trend. The general market trend is upward, and one rule of trading is, “Never trade against the trend.” When the general trend is upward, we look for Supply Zones to set buy limit orders. However, when the general trend is downward, we look for Demand Zones to set out sell limit orders. On the 15-minute chart, the same situation is playing out, but on a smaller scale. An impulse move happened right around when the XRP ruling came out, causing the BTC price to spike. It is possible smart money had insider information about the ruling and used the opportunity to liquidate the huge amount of stop loss set between $30,800 and $31,000. We expect the price of BTC to fall back to $30,600 in the short -term and to $26,000 in the short to long term.  Note that the fall to these figures may happen in a flash-crash fashion, and not necessarily a slow descent.

2023-07-13 08:00:00+00:00,The Role Of Bitcoin For Economic And Human Rights Empowerment In Africa,https://blockzeit.com/the-role-of-bitcoin-for-economic-and-human-rights-empowerment-in-africa/,"Amid its diverse cultural heritage and rich natural resources, Africa is considered to have an unreliable financial infrastructure compared to its Western neighbors. It’s for this reason, however, that Bitcoin is thriving in the continent. The decentralized digital currency has captured the attention of individuals, entrepreneurs, and activists who believe in its potential to revolutionize the economic landscape in the global south. A recent article by Forbes explores the key reasons why many Africans are now turning to Bitcoin. Its positive impact on the fields of human rights and infrastructure development is examined, too. TBL's Africa Correspondent @noelynesumba was featured in @ForbesCrypto's latest piece.“#Bitcoin presented a glimmer of hope for altering the economic landscape in the global south, particularly Africa”Read @PlebiusEconomus' full article👇https://t.co/ooUR08ZXzP Based on the insights gleaned from the post, Bitcoin presents a beacon of hope for millions of Africans who have limited access to traditional financial services. The continent’s inadequate banking systems, coupled with high fees and limited access to credit, have left many excluded from the formal economy. However, the decentralized nature of the digital asset allows individuals to bypass these barriers. Meanwhile, by leveraging Bitcoin’s open-source technology, Africans can transact securely, store value, and engage in economic activities without the need for intermediaries or expensive infrastructure. The growing demand for financial inclusion also paved the way for the development of Machankura, a text-based platform providing a way to trade Bitcoin without the use of a computer, smartphone, or Internet access. In many parts of Africa, the lack of reliable electricity has hindered economic progress and limited opportunities for social mobility. However, Bitcoin is paving the way for a transformative change in this regard. Bitcoin miners, who secure the network and validate transactions, have begun partnering with local communities and organizations to build out energy infrastructure. By investing in hydroelectric facilities and other renewable energy projects, the Bitcoin mining activities not only support the network but also provide the necessary electricity for communities to thrive. This newfound access to electricity enables work to be done after dark, facilitates online education, and creates economic opportunities that were previously far from possible in the area. Bitcoin’s impact extends beyond financial inclusion and infrastructure development. Activists like Anita Posch and Noelyne Sumba are championing Bitcoin as a tool to enforce human rights and empower disadvantaged communities. Through initiatives such as Bitcoin for Fairness and grassroots education efforts, they are raising awareness about the positive potential of Bitcoin in emerging countries. By embracing Bitcoin, individuals can protect their wealth from devaluation caused by rampant inflation and corrupt governance. This decentralized currency provides a ray of hope and optimism for people facing economic uncertainties in authoritarian-led nations within the region. While Bitcoin adoption in Africa is still in its early stages, the momentum is building. As more individuals and businesses become aware of the advantages of Bitcoin, communities are emerging across the continent. Ghana, Zambia, and Kenya are witnessing the growth of Bitcoin communities, with hundreds more anticipated to be established in the coming years. Although Bitcoin’s volatility may raise concerns, many Africans understand that its long-term potential outweighs short-term fluctuations. The ongoing efforts of advocates like Posch and Sumba are instrumental in spreading the positive message of Bitcoin throughout the region, fostering economic empowerment and facilitating greater financial autonomy for citizens. Bitcoin’s potential to reshape Africa’s financial landscape is undeniable. By providing financial inclusion, incentivizing infrastructure development, and promoting human rights, this decentralized currency is offering hope and opportunities to millions across the continent. As awareness and adoption continue to grow, Bitcoin has the potential to unlock unprecedented economic empowerment, transforming the lives of individuals and communities in Africa and beyond."
2023-07-13 06:00:00+00:00,Vanguard’s Significant Investments Signal Growing Institutional Interest In Bitcoin Mining,https://blockzeit.com/vanguards-significant-investments-signal-growing-institutional-interest-in-bitcoin-mining/,"Vanguard Group’s recent investments in Bitcoin mining companies indicate a growing trend of institutional interest in the cryptocurrency industry and its potential implications for the legitimacy and future of Bitcoin mining. Vanguard Group, a massive asset management firm with $7 trillion in assets under management, has recently made substantial investments in the Bitcoin mining industry.  These investments demonstrate a noteworthy shift in sentiment among traditional financial institutions towards cryptocurrencies and indicate growing institutional interest in this endeavor. Vanguard Group has significantly increased its exposure to Bitcoin mining companies, particularly Marathon Digital Holdings and Riot Blockchain.  JUST IN: Asset manager Vanguard Group, with over $7 trillion AUM, has purchased a 10% stake in #Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms 👀The institutions are here 🙌 pic.twitter.com/zg2c35yTqE Vanguard’s investments in Marathon Digital have surged by 60%, with holdings now standing at 17.5 million shares worth approximately $280.5 million. Simultaneously, its stake in Riot Blockchain has risen by nearly 18%, totaling 17.9 million shares valued at over $281 million. These investments bring Vanguard’s total investment in Bitcoin miners to a substantial $560 million. Vanguard’s heightened investments in Bitcoin mining companies signify a broader trend of traditional financial institutions recognizing the potential of cryptocurrencies. It is worth noting that just two years ago, Vanguard had expressed skepticism about the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies. However, its recent investments and BlackRock’s CEO describing Bitcoin as an “international asset” reflect a shift in sentiment. Apart from Vanguard, other major players in the asset management industry are also entering the crypto space. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with $9.5 trillion assets under management, has applied for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and holds a substantial stake in Marathon Digital.  Fidelity Investments, the largest mutual fund company in the United States, is also considering offering Bitcoin investment products.  These developments highlight the increasing acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial system. Vanguard carries broader implications for the industry’s legitimacy. As a prominent institutional investor, their involvement lends credibility to Bitcoin mining and attracts more attention from other investors. This legitimacy could help foster greater trust in the sector and potentially lead to increased investment inflows. While institutional interest in crypto and digital assets is growing, it is not without its challenges and criticisms. Critics argue that investments in the industry legitimize a speculative asset class that poses environmental concerns due to its high energy consumption. Concentration of power within the Bitcoin mining industry is also a concern, as large institutional players gain significant stakes, potentially impacting the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies. The outlook remains uncertain. The price of Bitcoin continues to be a significant driver of mining profitability, and the industry’s revenue has soared alongside Bitcoin’s price increases. However, regulatory challenges from entities like the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could continue to pose hurdles for the industry’s growth. Vanguard Group’s substantial investments represent a significant milestone in the industry’s evolution. Traditional financial institutions are increasingly recognizing the potential and value of cryptocurrencies, with growing institutional interest in Bitcoin mining.  Vanguard’s involvement, alongside other major asset managers, provides legitimacy and fosters greater institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies. However, challenges such as environmental concerns and regulatory uncertainties still loom over the industry. As the landscape continues to evolve, the industry’s future will depend on navigating these challenges while capitalizing on the growing institutional interest and broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies."
2023-07-12 16:00:00+00:00,Former SEC Chair Pushes For Approval Of Spot Bitcoin ETFs,https://blockzeit.com/former-sec-chair-pushes-for-approval-of-spot-bitcoin-etfs/,"This article explores insights from former SEC Chair Jay Clayton regarding changing perception of the cryptocurrency market, highlighting the evolving market dynamics and the arguments put forth by institutional players as they seek regulatory approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. In a series of interviews, former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton shared his insights on the potential approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and discussed the changing perception of the cryptocurrency market. Clayton, who served as SEC chair from 2017 to 2020, revealed his initial reservations about Bitcoin trading but acknowledged the significant shifts that have taken place since his tenure. During a recent interview at CNBC, Clayton highlighted the remarkable development of Bitcoin, noting that reputable companies are now willing to put their names behind Bitcoin trading and custody services.  ""I was very skeptical with trading in the #bitcoin market when I was SEC Chair,"" says Jay Clayton. ""But if you can demonstrate that the spot market has similar efficacy to the futures market, it would be hard to resist approving a #bitcoin ETF."" pic.twitter.com/mig05ZUwIL He acknowledged a transformation in the perception of the market, where these companies believe that the trading and custody protections are now sufficient to offer products with their reputations at stake.  This change in perception surprised Clayton, who once viewed the crypto industry as predominantly offshore retail with potential for manipulation and wash trading. The conversation shifted to the possibility of a Bitcoin ETF, and Clayton provided valuable insights into the SEC’s approach.  JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Former SEC Chairman says Spot #Bitcoin ETFs should be approved. pic.twitter.com/szb6vTzpLj He explained that the approval of a futures-based ETF was based on perceived surveillance and investor protections in the futures market. However, he acknowledged that institutions argue the distinctions between the futures and spot markets have diminished, making a spot Bitcoin ETF more efficient for investors.  If a spot ETF can demonstrate similar efficacy and meet the necessary investor protection standards, Clayton suggested it would be challenging for the SEC to resist approving such an ETF. Clayton’s comments align with recent developments in the cryptocurrency space, as leading financial institutions such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and WisdomTree have submitted ETF applications to the SEC.  These applications indicate growing interest from institutional investors in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through regulated investment vehicles. While the SEC has yet to approve any of these applications, the evolving market perception and arguments put forth by these institutions could shape the SEC’s decision-making process. Reflecting on the regulatory landscape, Clayton also addressed a proposed rule that broadens the scope of negligence in investment lawsuits. He argued against imposing a negligence standard in an inherently uncertain investment environment, emphasizing that investment outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty.  Clayton stressed the importance of aligning interests between investors and managers, promoting a focus on mutual goals rather than imposing contract terms on private parties. This perspective underscores the need for a balanced regulatory approach that fosters innovation while protecting investors. CryptoWendyO, in her latest YouTube upload, questioned Jay Clayton’s sudden endorsement of a Bitcoin spot ETF and pointed out that during his time as SEC chair, he never expressed such support or approved a Bitcoin spot ETF.  She speculated on the timing of Clayton’s statement, considering recent applications by prominent institutions like BlackRock, indicating Coinbase as an intermediary for their Bitcoin spot ETF. She suggested that Clayton’s remarks may be influenced by external factors and insinuated financial motivations behind the endorsement. Tony Edward, the host of the Thinking Crypto Podcast, retweeted the news about Clayton’s statement and questioned why Clayton did not approve a Bitcoin spot ETF when he served as SEC chairman. Then why didn't you approve a Bitcoin Spot ETF when you were the SEC chairman Jay? 🙄 https://t.co/PzCyXBDPL2 Edward’s comment implied skepticism about Clayton’s sudden change of opinion and raised questions about his actions during his tenure at the SEC. The debate surrounding Bitcoin ETFs continues to evolve, with institutions arguing for the efficiency and efficacy of a spot ETF compared to futures-based ETFs. As the SEC reviews applications from major financial institutions, the evolving landscape and changing market dynamics will likely play a crucial role in shaping the future of Bitcoin ETF approval. Moving forward, a balanced regulatory approach that addresses investor protection concerns while encouraging innovation will be essential for the continued growth and maturation of the cryptocurrency market."
2023-07-12 10:00:00+00:00,MicroStrategy’s Stock To Benefit From Bitcoin Halving,https://blockzeit.com/microstrategys-stock-to-benefit-from-bitcoin-halving/,"MicroStrategy’s stock is set to rise with Bitcoin halving, as Berenberg Capital predicts increased value from BTC. As the Bitcoin (BTC) halving event of 2024 approaches, market experts are turning their attention to MicroStrategy, the renowned technology company led by Michael Saylor. With its substantial Bitcoin holdings and strong correlation with the cryptocurrency’s price, MicroStrategy is poised for potential gains. Berenberg Capital, an investment firm, has revealed its optimistic outlook for MicroStrategy ahead of the Bitcoin halving event. Scheduled for April 26, 2024, the halving serves as the primary driving force behind the firm’s positive stance.  Berenberg currently holds a price target of $430 for MicroStrategy’s stock, indicating a notable increase from its current price of $407.71 per share. Bitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years and is an integral part of the Bitcoin protocol. It involves reducing the rate at which new bitcoins are created and awarded to miners. This mechanism helps control inflation and limit the supply of bitcoins in circulation.  Halving events have historically had significant implications for the supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin, which can ultimately impact its price. MicroStrategy’s stock has demonstrated a strong correlation with the price of Bitcoin, estimated to be around 90%. This correlation suggests that as Bitcoin experiences a rally, MicroStrategy’s stock is likely to follow suit.  Since the beginning of the year, MicroStrategy’s stock has soared by over 181%, showcasing its bullish trend. Berenberg suggests that if the historical pattern established by previous halving events continues, a pre-halving rally could begin around four months before the event. The halving events create a scarcity effect, reducing the number of new BTC tokens entering the market. With a lower supply and stable or increasing demand for Bitcoin, upward price pressure is expected. MicroStrategy’s substantial BTC holdings of 152,333 put the company in a favorable position to benefit from potential price increases.  As the price of Bitcoin rises, the overall value of MicroStrategy’s holdings appreciates, potentially enhancing its stock price and market performance. With the upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024, MicroStrategy’s stock is attracting attention due to its strong correlation with Bitcoin’s price and its significant BTC holdings. Berenberg’s bullish outlook, with a price target of $430 for MicroStrategy’s stock, further emphasizes the positive sentiment surrounding the company.  As market participants eagerly await the halving event, they anticipate potential gains for MicroStrategy as Bitcoin’s price rallies. The close relationship between MicroStrategy and Bitcoin positions the company to capitalize on the halving’s impact and reinforces its market outlook."
2023-07-11 14:00:00+00:00,Crypto Community And Algorithms Weigh In On The Future Of Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/crypto-community-and-algorithms-weigh-in-on-the-future-of-bitcoin/,"As Bitcoin continues to make waves in the financial landscape, investors and enthusiasts are eagerly analyzing price forecasts to gain insights into the cryptocurrency’s future performance. A recent analysis sheds light on the predictions made by both the crypto community and advanced machine learning algorithms regarding Bitcoin’s price by the end of July. This article delves into the contrasting projections, explores the current state of the digital asset, and highlights the significant resistance levels it faces. NEWS : Crypto community with 84% historical accuracy sets Bitcoin price for July 31, 2023: Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s leading crypto asset, experienced a remarkable surge in value during the latter half of June, captivating …… #Bitcoin #Crypto #Nft https://t.co/59ow9Uj8Cx pic.twitter.com/e8y9jzWsx7 Over the past few weeks, Bitcoin has experienced a significant surge in value, recapturing the attention of investors worldwide. The renewed optimism surrounding the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies has propelled the digital asset on an impressive upward trajectory, reestablishing its position as a dominant force in the market. With the price surpassing $30,000, the stage is set for a compelling analysis of Bitcoin’s future price movements. Finbold’s analysis reveals two distinct forecasts for Bitcoin’s price on July 31, 2023. The crypto community projection found at CoinMarketCap’s Bitcoin price estimate feature which boasts 84.46% accuracy, expects an average price of $26,818. The numbers indicate a potential decline of approximately 11% from the current level. On the other hand, an advanced machine learning algorithm employed by the PricePredictions platform predicts a rally to $33,329 by the same timeframe. This suggests a potential increase of over 10% from the present value. As of writing at around 12:00 PM UTC time, Bitcoin is trading at $30,430, displaying a minor recovery of 0.46% over the past 24 hours. So far, the cryptocurrency has enjoyed robust gains of more than 18% on a monthly basis. These gains can be attributed to a surge in applications for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, indicating a growing interest in Bitcoin among institutional investors. Right now, Bitcoin faces a critical challenge as it tests the significant resistance zone around $31,000. This level has proven to be a formidable barrier for the digital asset for over a year. Overcoming this blockade could potentially give way to the next resistance level at $32,500, which will coincide with the 100-weekly moving average (WMA), based on the source. Looking ahead, another noteworthy obstacle lies at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, situated around $36,000. The predictions surrounding Bitcoin’s price for the end of this month, present two contrasting perspectives from the crypto community and advanced machine learning algorithms. While the community expects a slight decline in Bitcoin’s price, the algorithm predicts a significant rally. As the cryptocurrency continues to exhibit impressive gains and faces critical resistance levels, the future of Bitcoin remains uncertain. Investors and enthusiasts alike will definitely closely monitor Bitcoin’s price movements at this point, seeking to capitalize on the opportunities presented by this dynamic and ever-evolving digital asset. Although algorithms show a bullish outlook on Bitcoin, this alone should not be construed as a strong recommendation to pour money into it. As always, due diligence must be exercised along the way by weighing in all other factors that drive cryptocurrency values. Also, it wouldn’t hurt to seek expert opinion from a licensed financial adviser for good measure."

2023-07-10 06:00:00+00:00,Plot Twist: BlackRock CEO Endorses Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/plot-twist-blackrock-ceo-endorses-bitcoin/,"In a surprising turn of events, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has made a significant shift in his stance towards Bitcoin. Previously antagonistic to cryptocurrencies, the boss of the world’s largest asset manager now believes that Bitcoin has the potential to revolutionize the world of finance. This unexpected endorsement has elicited a mixed response from the crypto community, with some expressing enthusiasm while others remain skeptical about the implications of Fink’s preferred investment vehicle, the exchange-traded fund (ETF), on the fundamental principles of Bitcoin. According to a report from Coindesk, Fink who was once critical of Bitcoin and even referring to it as “an index of money laundering” recently acknowledged the transformative power of cryptocurrencies. He highlighted their potential to revolutionize the financial landscape, stating that his company’s main objective is to make trading and investing in Bitcoin more accessible and cost-effective. This shift in perspective by such a prominent figure in the financial world could pave the way for wider acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin, firmly establishing it within mainstream usage. While Fink’s endorsement of cryptocurrencies may seem like a positive development, some experts are concerned about the use of ETFs as the preferred investment vehicle. ETFs, unlike the original ideals of Bitcoin, operate within traditional financial frameworks and are traded on regulated stock exchanges through regulated brokers. This deviation from Bitcoin’s core principles, designed to counteract the excesses of Wall Street and offer a decentralized peer-to-peer payments network free from government control, raises questions about the potential consequences of incorporating Bitcoin into a regulated investment structure. Bitcoin’s core philosophy revolves around decentralization, self-sovereignty, and the elimination of third-party intermediaries. The control individuals have over their funds, without the need to rely on trusted third parties, has been one of the key attractions of the crypto. Critics argue that ETFs and other centralized investment vehicles undermine this fundamental aspect of Bitcoin’s existence, potentially diluting its unique value proposition based on the source. As the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin grows, concerns arise regarding whether newcomers to the cryptocurrency space fully appreciate and protect its decentralized properties. The risk of prioritizing accessibility and convenience over the core principles of Bitcoin becomes apparent. Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy, a digital-asset financial firm, warns that the industry should not lose sight of the real promise of crypto, which lies in its decentralization and independence from centralized alternatives. While Fink’s endorsement of Bitcoin may be seen as a game-changer and a potential catalyst for increased institutional adoption, it is essential to consider the implications. His focus on the promise of digital wealth rather than the economic benefits for BlackRock could inspire other Wall Street investors to express comfort with Bitcoin and allocate more capital to the digital asset. However, the clash between the traditional investment structure of ETFs and the decentralized nature of Bitcoin remains a topic of concern within the crypto community. The unexpected endorsement of Bitcoin by the BlackRock CEO signifies a significant shift in his perception of cryptocurrencies. While his newfound support may facilitate mass adoption and further legitimize Bitcoin, there are valid concerns about the clash between ETFs and the fundamental principles of decentralization that underpin Bitcoin’s existence. Amid these developments, it is always crucial to strike a balance between accessibility and preserving the core values that make cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin truly unique and groundbreaking."
2023-07-07 10:41:31+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Slumps Despite Positive Market Sentiment,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-price-slumps-despite-positive-market-sentiment/,"Bitcoin price has been on the rocks for the past week, despite more firms applying for the Bitcoin spot ETF. Market sentiment was and is still bullish but the price seems to be going down. Let’s dive into Bitcoin price this week. Last week, Deribit’s Bitcoin options aggregate open interest for June 30 showed that Bitcoin would be having an easy time on its way to $41,000. Consequently, we predicted that Bitcoin might have an eventful week beginning in July. However, throughout the week, Bitcoin has been on a consolidation trend. Consolidation trends are usually artificially created by market makers (MMs) to snatch liquidity from retail traders before the real move upwards (or downwards) happens. From the chart above, the Buy Side Liquidity (BSL) Hunt shows areas where Shorts were liquidated, but the MMs had not had their fill. The liquidity hunt has been going on for the past two weeks.  A quick scan on Coinglass shows that over the two weeks, $616.89 million worth of Shorts has been liquidated across eight of the largest crypto exchanges. Comparing the BSL hunt with the Sell Side Liquidity (SSL) hunt, we can see that MMs have only hunted a small portion of the SSL. This information is an indicator of what is to come. Then, there are two possible outcomes: If the MMs (AKA the smart money) are taking out the BSL, it means that they may be planning to dump the price of Bitcoin, and cannot allow the Short sellers to benefit from the imminent crash.  This theory is further fuelled by the significantly low amount of SSL hunts seen on the chart. When they decide to push the price down, they will clear the sell stops for the Long-biased traders.  It may be a false move to trick the traders. Traders analyze charts in the same way. Most traders are probably thinking the BSL is a psychological resistance. Most of them have been analyzing the price action and can see the aggressive liquidity hunting that is ongoing.In their mind, they are thinking Theory 1 is in play. But actually, what the MMs are planning is to push the price up. By tricking traders that they are planning to dump the price (by clearing BSL and triggering), they cause many traders to enter long positions.  What then transpires over the next days is an aggressive move to the downside that takes out all SSL and liquidates the long-biased traders with open positions. The move also triggers any Buy Limit orders of the Long-biased traders. Shortly after, the MMs change the trend aggressively and push the price up. Only the last batch of traders who had set their Buy Limit orders at the SSL and patiently waited will be in profit.

2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2023-07-05 04:00:00+00:00,Institutional Trust Fuels Optimism As Bitcoin ETF Race Takes Off,https://blockzeit.com/institutional-trust-fuels-optimism-as-bitcoin-etf-race-takes-off/,"Institutional investors are once again showing a keen interest in the cryptocurrency market, with several major financial giants rallying to file their applications for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. This resurgence in institutional trust has been instrumental in driving up Bitcoin prices and generating renewed optimism in the crypto market. Recently, seven institutional firms, including BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, have filed applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This development mirrors a similar trend observed prior to the bull run of 2020-2021 when institutional interest played a crucial role in driving Bitcoin’s value based on expert analysts. Following the event, institutional interest in the crypto sector had waned after a prolonged crypto winter in 2022, marked by regulatory scrutiny and the collapse of major crypto exchanges such as FTX. However, the news of financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Valkyrie filing applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF has sparked a resurgence in investment and pushed Bitcoin’s price above $30,000. While previous attempts at filing spot Bitcoin ETF applications faced rejection or withdrawal, the entry of BlackRock, the asset management giant, has increased the chances of securing approval from the SEC. Industry experts believe BlackRock has a 50% chance of getting its spot Bitcoin ETF approved, which could pave the way for the entry of other institutional giants. The increased institutional interest in cryptocurrencies is evident from the growing number of institutional investors participating in the market. Previously cautious, institutions are now recognizing the value and utility of Bitcoin as a unique and scarce asset that cannot be debased. Global institutions continue to show interest in cryptocurrencies, especially in the face of record inflation and economic uncertainties. The recent surge in spot Bitcoin ETF filings by major asset managers not only demonstrates increased institutional demand for Bitcoin but also has the potential to attract new retail investors. The approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF is expected to inspire competition among financial companies, diverting funds from traditional markets to the crypto space. This broader participation will likely have a positive impact on the growth of the crypto market. With 2023 and 2024 expected to be crucial for spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, industry insiders predict a bullish future for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market according to reports. Institutional investors entering the market in anticipation of the next Bitcoin halving event, scheduled for April 2024, is seen as a significant bullish sign. Historically, halving events have triggered price surges as the scarcity factor intensifies demand from retail traders and institutional giants alike. The race to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs by institutional firms indicates a resurgent institutional trust in the cryptocurrency market. The growing interest from both institutional and retail investors has reignited optimism and pushed Bitcoin prices higher. As regulatory frameworks continue to evolve, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs is anticipated to drive further growth in the crypto market and foster broader participation from traditional financial institutions."
2023-07-04 08:00:00+00:00,Analysts Predict Potential Bitcoin Bullish Rally By Year-End,https://blockzeit.com/analysts-predict-potential-bitcoin-bullish-rally-by-year-end/,"After a dismal performance at the end of last year, cryptocurrency lovers and analysts have been eagerly watching for a potential Bitcoin bullish rally. The good news is that it may be coming by the end of 2023. After surpassing the psychological threshold of $30,000, Bitcoin faces a formidable resistance zone around the $31,000 mark. Breaking through this barrier could trigger a significant spike in prices, with some analysts speculating that the numbers might even reach $80,000 before the year’s end. According to Finbold, market analysts have observed that the more frequently a resistance line is tested, the weaker it becomes. Drawing a parallel with historical patterns, experts highlight that Bitcoin’s ability to repeatedly test the $470 resistance in 2016 ultimately led to a breakthrough. The observed trend suggests that the current resistance around $31,000 may weaken over time, potentially paving the way for further upward movement. Several crypto specialists share an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin’s future. Altcoin Sherpa‘s analysis of one-month levels suggests that Bitcoin has its sights set on the $40,000 mark in the mid-term. $BTC: I still think that 32k gets taken out either way- if we are going lower, 32k is going to get tagged and then we head to 25k or whatever; if we go higher then we're obviously breaking 32k. Seems too likely given the environment. #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/xeg0aNxIJ0 Furthermore, Trader Tardigrade notes that Bitcoin’s Renko chart, which focuses on price movement rather than fixed time intervals, mirrors the patterns seen from 2019 to 2021. This similarity suggests that Bitcoin could reach $80,000 by the close of 2023. <Alan's Macro Analysis>#Bitcoin is forming consolidation at the Key Level.The consolidation switches from a contracting triangle to an expanding triangle as compared with 2015.Massive Bull Run follows the consolidation.#BTC #Crypto pic.twitter.com/tmkt8tTDDH Echoing this sentiment, Twitter analysts Moustache (@el_crypto_prof) believes that Bitcoin’s bullish megaphone pattern remains intact, with a target price of $85,000 by the end of the year. #Bitcoin – Bullish Megaphone-Pattern still intact✅– Trend line holds as wellUpper-Trendline Target = $85.000 for one $BTC. pic.twitter.com/U8F9tVFWhM As of July 4 at 6:00 AM UTC time, Bitcoin is trading slightly over $31,000, indicating a slight recovery of 1.24% for the day and 1.73% for the week. Over the past month, Bitcoin has experienced a more substantial gain of 14.51%. Overall, these figures provide additional context to the ongoing price analysis and predictions. It is worth noting that not all projections align with the bullish forecasts. The self-learning machine algorithm deployed by the crypto tracking platform CoinCodex offers a more conservative estimate, predicting that Bitcoin’s price by the end of 2023 will likely fall below the $38,000 mark, given the prevailing market trends. As Bitcoin continues to navigate the resistance zone around $31,000, cryptocurrency enthusiasts eagerly anticipate a potential bull run and a surge in price by the end of 2023. Market analysts point to historical patterns, weakening resistance levels, and various chart analyses to support their optimistic projections. On the other hand, it’s important to consider diverging prognoses, such as the more conservative estimate provided by the algorithm of the crypto tracker, CoinCodex. Ultimately, the future trajectory of Bitcoin’s price remains uncertain, and investors should always exercise caution and due diligence while making financial decisions."
2023-06-30 12:00:00+00:00,BTC To RUB Conversion Ruled Money Laundering by Russian Supreme Court,https://blockzeit.com/btc-to-rub-conversion-ruled-money-laundering-by-russian-supreme-court/,"Legal landscape for cryptocurrency transactions in Russia reshaped as Supreme Court deems BTC to fiat conversions by criminals as money laundering. In a significant ruling, the Russian Supreme Court has broadened the scope of money laundering to include converting cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies such as the Russian Ruble. This decision overturns previous court rulings and sets a precedent for future crypto-related money laundering cases. The ruling addresses two cases involving individuals engaged in drug trafficking who accepted Bitcoin as payment. Subsequently, they converted the cryptocurrency into fiat currencies, specifically the Russian Ruble, and transferred the funds to different accounts. Initially, lower courts acquitted the defendants of money laundering charges, arguing that the converted fiat funds were not introduced into economic circulation. However, the prosecutor’s appeal led the case to the Supreme Court, prompting a reconsideration of the matter. The Supreme Court classified cryptocurrency as a crime subject under articles 174 and 174.1 of the Russian Federation’s Criminal Code, established by the Russian Armed Forces in 2019. According to Article 174.1, individuals can be deemed guilty of money laundering, regardless of whether they profit from the laundered funds. Merely attempting to legitimize criminal proceeds is sufficient for the offense. The court’s interpretation of the relevant section of the Criminal Code now encompasses all financial transactions involving the proceeds of crime, including the conversion of virtual assets. By transferring the converted fiat funds to other accounts, the court determined that the funds were already in economic circulation, irrespective of their purpose. This landmark ruling is expected to shape future judicial practices related to the illicit use of cryptocurrencies in Russia. It provides a legal precedent for courts and prosecutors to consider similar transactions as money laundering, facilitating the seizure and liquidation of tokens in crypto-related cases. Moreover, it will likely result in harsher sentences in criminal cases involving cryptocurrencies. The ruling reflects ongoing efforts by Russian authorities to regulate and monitor cryptocurrency transactions. While Russian law recognizes cryptocurrencies as payment and property, converting them into fiat currencies for further circulation has raised concerns and increased scrutiny. The Russian Supreme Court’s ruling expands the definition of money laundering to encompass the conversion of cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies. This decision sets a precedent, clarifying how the Russian legal system addresses crypto-related money laundering cases and ensuring stricter enforcement.  It has the potential to deter illicit activities involving cryptocurrencies in the country while signaling the need for continuous adaptation to the complexities of addressing crypto-related crimes."
2023-06-30 09:30:59+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Remains Above $30,500 As Bulls Secure $440M Profit In BTC Options",https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-price-remains-above-30500-as-bulls-secure-440m-profit-in-btc-options/,"Bitcoin hit a high of $31,000 its previous rally and retraced to $30,000. A few days of consolidation have revealed a bullish signal. Should bulls be ready to go for another ride upwards?  Let’s find out in today’s market wrap. A barrage of positive news flooding the market left Bitcoin with no choice but to fly upwards last week. Every market participant was crying ‘Bull Market Now!’. In last week’s analysis, Bitcoin went up beautifully following the above mentioned news (follow links to read more on them). While the asset has slowed down, the momentum has not. Pullbacks are healthy corrections in the long-term upward trend for any stock or cryptocurrency. They are often looked upon as an opportunity to enter a trade that provides a window for bigger return over the long term. Should the bulls keep this up, Bitcoin might just breakout and head for the $34,716 mark. In the tug of war between bears and bulls, Bitcoin price began to consolidate over the past week, leading to the formation of a bullish pennant, which seems to be transforming into a bullish flag. If BTC does break out to the upside, bulls are looking at a +12.67% increase. Some nice news might help nudge Bitcoin. $4.5 trillion asset manager, Fidelity, also officially refiled for a Bitcoin spot ETF, further adding fuel to the fire. This coming week seems like it is going to be even more packed and eventful for Bitcoin. BREAKING: $4.5 trillion Fidelity officially refiles for spot #Bitcoin ETF pic.twitter.com/IKhuJHlV2d $4.7 billion BTC monthly options will expire on June 30, 2023. This might play a key role in determining whether the $30,000 price will consolidate as long-term support. If the price of Bitcoin remains around 30,500 at 11:00 am UTC+3 on June 30, only $630M worth of BTC call options will be available. Based on Deribit’s Bitcoin options aggregate open interest for June 30, here are the scenarios that could ensue:  At the time of writing (11:00 AM UTC+3), Bitcoin is trading at $30,764, which is well above the $30,500 level. This results in option (3) whose consequence is a net result that favors the call instruments by $440 million. To further simplify it, the bulls are in control, and to some extent answers the question ‘Will $30K be a new springboard for Bitcoin bulls?’ The bulls effectively secured a $440 million profit by keeping Bitcoin price above $30,000 in the short term and have further legitimized the right for other speculative traders to buy Bitcoin at $31,000 or $32,000. The future of cryptocurrency is looking brighter than ever!

The wallets, each holding 50 BTC, were mined back in 2010 and have recently been transferred to new addresses. The movement of these long-term holders, often referred to as “whales,” has become a subject of intrigue and speculation within the cryptocurrency community. This article explores the implications of these significant transactions and sheds light on the phenomenon of dormant Bitcoin whales resurfacing. Two Whale Wallets Move $3 Million in Bitcoin After 13 Years of Inactivity► https://t.co/hre2qGhC02 https://t.co/hre2qGhC02 Bitcoin whales, a term used to describe investors who accumulate substantial amounts of the cryptocurrency and hold onto it for extended periods, have always played a crucial role in the market. Their actions can impact Bitcoin’s price and serve as signals for other participants. This recent wave of whale activity represents the sixth and seventh instances this year where large amounts of BTC have been moved by long-term holders. The movement of these dormant Bitcoin wallets coincides with a resurgence of institutional interest in the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has experienced a remarkable surge in price, with a nearly 13% increase in just seven days based on CoinGecko data as of this writing at 4:00 AM UTC on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the price of BTC is pegged around the $30,390 mark in the same period. Such price movements have piqued the curiosity of institutional investors, leading to renewed interest and potentially prompting long-term holders to take action according to Decrypt. The success of HODLers, those who retain their Bitcoin investments over extended periods, is well-documented. While short-term traders often face losses due to Bitcoin’s inherent volatility, HODLers tend to reap substantial profits. Bitcoin’s long-term price appreciation has rewarded those who had the foresight to hold onto their investments. Interestingly, the Bitcoin mined in 2010 that has recently moved may have initially been a result of computer experts experimenting with the technology, but it remains uncertain if these coins are now in the hands of commercial entities. The resurfacing of these “elder” whale wallets has sparked speculation within the cryptocurrency community. Some researchers closely monitor price charts, searching for patterns and awakenings among dormant wallets. They theorize that the movement of BTC between these long-dormant whales may serve as a signal, potentially indicating an imminent price surge. However, predicting the future price of Bitcoin based solely on these movements remains a challenging task, often relying on subjective interpretations of patterns and signals. The recent movement of dormant Bitcoin wallets is not an isolated occurrence. Earlier this year, another long-term holder transferred $7.8 million worth of BTC after ten years of inactivity, adding to the growing wave of whale activity. Furthermore, just last week, an investor who had held 50 BTC for over a decade finally moved their coins to a new wallet. These instances further demonstrate the unpredictability and excitement surrounding the actions of these ancient Bitcoin whales. The sudden movement of two dormant Bitcoin wallets, holding a combined value of over $3 million, has attracted attention within the cryptocurrency community. These long-term holders, who have remained inactive for over a decade, have resurfaced amidst a period of heightened institutional interest and market momentum. While the motives behind these transactions remain unknown, they serve as a reminder of the impact that whales can have on the cryptocurrency market. As Bitcoin continues to evolve, the actions of these ancient whales will undoubtedly continue to captivate and fascinate those who closely follow the digital asset landscape."

2023-06-23 05:37:34+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Breaks $30K As EDX Exchange Hits The Market,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-breaks-30k-as-edx-exchange-hits-the-market/,"Bitcoin broke $30,000 on June 21, 2023, after news of the newly created EDX exchange starting operations broke. EDX Markets won’t handle customers’ digital assets directly or deal with individual customers directly. Sounds like an exchange for institutions. Bitcoin ran through the $30k mark with so much vigour, making many investors wonder if this was the beginning of a new bull run. In last week’s analysis, Bitcoin sat in a fascinating and risky zone. Blackrock’s news of the Bitcoin ETF application sent the asset up, preventing BTC from sliding below the 200-day moving average. The market would have generally turned bearish if Bitcoin had broken below it. This mammoth company that no one paid attention to has been buying up companies left, right and center recently. Bloomberg’s analyst, Eric Balchunas, says Blackrock is almost undefeated when going up against the SEC. Almost every one of its ETF applications in the past received SEC’s blessing. This is a ghastly difference compared to other Bitcoin ETF applicants over the years. To all those saying the BlackRock filing is a trust and not an ETF. Do you consider $GLD to be an ETF? Well, this is same thing. Lot of structures under “ETF” umbrella. Nothing like $GBTC. This is the real deal. The non-custodial exchange was launched in 2022 but went live on June 20, 2023. The exchange will be a marketplace for firms to negotiate prices and execute trades on digital assets. Some of the activities supported by EDX Markets include matching of buy and sell orders, something very similar to traditional exchanges like NASDAQ or NYSE. The non-custodial aspect raises a contradiction – how will they trade assets they don’t hold?  EDX will supposedly use third-party banks and/or crypto custodian institutions to hold customer assets. Customers cannot deposit crypto into the exchange – as regular crypto exchanges do. Therefore, the actual exchange of assets happens directly between the firms involved, and trades are settled through the transfer of crypto & cash between firms. Bitcoin quickly recovered this week as the gravity of the ETF filing hit the market. In addition, news of the largest banks in the United States, and indeed in the world, coming together to launch their crypto exchange sent FOMO into the market. Bitcoin pumped 12% in less than 48 hours, breaking the $30k mark. With that move, the asset effectively closed above the 200-day and the 50-day moving average. As of June 23, 2023, Bitcoin is bullish again. Moreover, the spike in price confirmed that the asset was in a rising triangle setup. Ascending Triangle setups usually break up to the upside. If BTC does break out of the setup, we would be looking at a potential +30% increase to $40,000.

2023-06-18 08:00:00+00:00,Potentials Unlocked By Recursive Inscriptions In The Bitcoin Blockchain,https://blockzeit.com/potentials-unlocked-by-recursive-inscriptions-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain/,"Bitcoin, the pioneer cryptocurrency, has long been associated with its revolutionary decentralized nature. However, its full potential for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) has remained largely unrealized until recently. Enter recursive inscriptions, a groundbreaking concept that has the potential to redefine the world of Ordinals. In this article, we delve into the realm of these types of inscriptions, exploring their capabilities, advantages, potential drawbacks, and their impact on the future of the Bitcoin ecosystem. My first recursive inscription:🔗 https://t.co/QduR3GGIKBA 3D gallery of my @OnChainMonkey Genesis collection.Each PFP is streaming off of the same single satoshi, which was inscribed February 8th: https://t.co/Nw0gbgBkPnDid you know what an Ordinal was over 4 months ago? pic.twitter.com/bFYDa8Rro6 Previously overshadowed by Ethereum and other purpose-built NFT blockchains, Bitcoin has made a stunning resurgence with the introduction of the Ordinals protocol early this year. This innovative off-blockchain system, pioneered by Casey Rodarmor, enables data to be inscribed onto individual satoshis, unleashing the potential for NFT-like collectibles and trading opportunities. The idea of recursive inscriptions was just made public on June 10. These allow developers to daisy-chain data from prior inscriptions, opening the doors to on-chain software applications and creating a new frontier of possibilities. Bitcoin’s blockchain, with its over 17,000 full nodes, provides an unprecedented distributed storage capacity. Each inscription can store up to 4MB of data, an enormous amount compared to the standard limitations. By utilizing existing inscriptions and calling data from them, developers can create robust software applications that run across the blockchain. This opens up exciting avenues for video games, movies, and complex software, potentially reaching gigabytes of data according to early adopters of the system like the developer hiding under the pseudonym Leonidas.org on Twitter. WTF are recursive inscriptions?Here is everything you need to know:Earlier this year the Ordinals Protocol introduced the ability for anyone to inscribe files fully on-chain onto Bitcoin. These inscriptions are self-contained and unaware of the other files that had been… pic.twitter.com/O3jt6lhaxT One of the key advantages of recursive inscriptions is the potential reduction in transaction fees and data storage needs. By reusing existing data and only adding new information, inscribers can significantly improve storage efficiency without duplicating files. This enhancement in efficiency not only reduces costs but also streamlines the overall blockchain network, making it more accessible for everyday users. Recursive inscriptions pave the way for the creation of new types of software applications, such as permissionless contracts. These contracts leverage Bitcoin’s indomitable hashrate and permanent storage to enforce their terms without relying on additional cryptographic mechanisms. By accessing repositories of pre-existing inscriptions containing complex code or data, users can surpass the current 4MB limit on each inscription, unlocking an extraordinary potential for innovation. As mentioned, some analysts even claim that the platform can be utilized to develop a fully-functioning 3D video game. Despite the promise of recursive inscriptions, skeptics are raising concerns about the reliance on a centralized group of developers to maintain ordinals. The possibility of arbitrary settings changes or disruptions to software and file storage hashes is a legitimate cause of apprehension. Additionally, as the popularity of recursive inscriptions grows, the influx of data inscriptions could ultimately lead to congestion in Bitcoin’s mempools, potentially driving up transaction fees for ordinary users. Recursive inscriptions are poised to revolutionize the Bitcoin ordinals community and the broader NFT landscape. With the potential to introduce novel software, reduce storage needs, and enable flexible programming, they offer a glimpse into a future where Bitcoin can rival Ethereum’s dominance in the NFT space. On the other hand, it is crucial to acknowledge that recursive inscriptions are still in their early stages of development, maintained by a limited number of developers, and subject to technical and financial vulnerabilities. Recursive inscriptions represent a promising frontier for Bitcoin’s evolution, showcasing the blockchain’s untapped potential beyond traditional transactions. While challenges and risks exist, the opportunities for innovation and creativity are vast. As the Bitcoin ecosystem continues to mature, the integration of recursive inscriptions could catalyze a new wave of decentralized applications, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with the world’s oldest and most renowned cryptocurrency."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2023-06-16 10:53:43+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Tests the 200 DMA as Blackrock Files for A Bitcoin Spot ETF,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-tests-the-200-day-ma-as-blackrock-files-for-a-bitcoin-spot-etf/,"It is that time of the bull cycle when talk of market bottom and adoption of BTC fills the crypto Twitter space. It is a great time to be alive, just before the bull run commences. The financial landscape has changed immensely, old players have gone down, and new ones have risen – namely Blackrock.  The SEC shook the markets last week with their lawsuit against Binance US. If it were older, BNB would have dropped straight to $20. But thanks to the resilience gained over time, the news only took 10% off the exchange token. Bitcoin fell just 6%, only to immediately recover (1) once everyone understood that only the US branch of the company had been affected. The company paused USD fiat channels on June 13, 2023. Users had been advised to withdraw their USD balances via bank transfers before that date. Moving on to this week, further good news streamed in this week as Binance.US has begun talks with the SEC that will prevent their assets from being frozen. It is not clear why the regulatory body suddenly became lenient and open to talks. Maybe it’s because new information was unearthed about the Chair, Gary Gensler, carrying out insider trading on Coinbase. Or maybe it is the fact that he offered his advisory services to Binance.US in 2019. Either way, that, coupled with the news of the Blackrock BTC ETF application, has put hope of an imminent bull run in the hearts and minds of investors. Despite the good news, Bitcoin is sitting in a hazardous zone. The asset just touched the 200-EMA on the daily chart and even closed slightly lower on June 14, 2023. However, on June 15, 2023, Blackrock’s news of the Bitcoin ETF application sent the asset up, negating the previous breakout below the 200-DMA.  This indicator is very key in determining the long-term trend of an asset. If Bitcoin breaks below it, the market will generally turn bearish. The market has already been trending below the 50 DMA since the beginning of May 2023. If it goes lower and the 50 DMA crosses the 200 DMA, then we have a death cross. The death cross appears on a chart when a stock’s short-term moving average, usually the 50-day, crosses below its long-term moving average, usually the 200-day.  Although Blackrock is not a new player, the company has operated in the shadows for a long time. The company filed for a Bitcoin ETF application with the SEC, a move that sent bullish signals across the crypto space. Many think this might push BTC to the $1 million price mark.

2023-06-12 06:00:00+00:00,Two Russian Nationals Indicted In $400 Million Mt. Gox Bitcoin Hack Case,https://blockzeit.com/two-russian-nationals-indicted-in-400-million-mt-gox-bitcoin-hack-case/,"In a major development in the world of cryptocurrency, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) recently charged two Russian individuals in connection with the notorious Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange hack that occurred in 2014. The suspects, identified as Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner, stand accused of laundering a staggering 647,000 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $400 million at the time of the incident. This latest development sheds light on the complexity of cybercrimes involving cryptos and the efforts to bring perpetrators to justice. Feds charge two men for the $400 million Bitcoin hack that took down Mt. Gox https://t.co/GtE3t90IN5 pic.twitter.com/ceoI4VqJr2 According to the DOJ’s press release last Friday, Bilyuchenko and Verner are believed to have been involved in a conspiracy to launder the stolen Bitcoins from Mt. Gox. The indictment alleges that the stolen funds were channeled through various avenues, including the now-defunct BTC-e crypto exchange. The authorities previously indicted Alexander Vinnik, who had connections with BTC-e and was extradited to the US in 2017. The newly unsealed indictment suggests that Bilyuchenko, Verner, and other accomplices participated in laundering over 300,000 Bitcoins connected to the Mt. Gox hack. Mt. Gox was once a leading cryptocurrency exchange, handling a significant portion of global Bitcoin transactions. However, the exchange suffered a catastrophic hack in 2014, resulting in its insolvency and the loss of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins belonging to its users. The arrest of Bilyuchenko and Verner highlights their alleged involvement in contributing to the downfall of Mt. Gox. Alexey Bilyuchenko, one of the accused individuals, faces charges related to conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money services business. The DOJ alleges that Bilyuchenko utilized the stolen funds to establish BTC-e, a platform that reportedly facilitated the transfer, laundering, and storage of illicit proceeds generated from cybercriminal activities worldwide. If convicted, Bilyuchenko could face a lengthy prison sentence exceeding two decades. Aleksandr Verner, the second suspect charged by the DOJ, is accused of conspiring to commit money laundering. The authorities are investigating Verner’s alleged role in facilitating the movement of illicit funds associated with the Mt. Gox hack. If found guilty, Verner could similarly face a maximum prison term of two decades. The indictment of these two individuals in connection with the Mt. Gox hack serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by the cryptocurrency industry in combating cybercrime. While the industry has made significant strides in implementing robust security measures, incidents like these highlight the need for continued vigilance and collaboration between stakeholders to safeguard digital assets and protect users. The charges brought against Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner by the US DOJ shed more light on the alleged involvement of these individuals in the notorious Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange hack. The indictment accuses them of participating in money laundering schemes, channeling stolen digital assets through platforms like BTC-e. It should be noted though that the sentences mentioned are merely estimates if each individual is found guilty of the charges filed in court. The actual penalty may be reduced depending on mitigating circumstances or other elements presented by the defense. On the other hand, these may also be increased based on aggravating circumstances or any other charges that may arise along the way, if there are any. As the case unfolds, it emphasizes the ongoing efforts to hold cybercriminals accountable and safeguard the integrity of the cryptocurrency ecosystem."
2023-06-09 10:20:58+00:00,Market Wrap: Turbulent Times for Bitcoin As SEC Rattles the Markets with Lawsuits,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-turbulent-times-for-bitcoin-as-sec-rattles-the-markets-with-lawsuits/,"The markets this week got shaken massively as news of a lawsuit by the SEC against Binance broke the crypto space. Bitcoin lost 6% of its value in a day and countless other tokens took a substantive hit.  The charts are getting harder and harder to analyze with such unprecedented fundamental news. Bitcoin’s multi-month falling wedge is still in play. We had hoped that a bullish catalyst would push the price of the asset out of this pattern. The bullish catalyst was the debt ceiling deal that was conveniently secured just hours before the June 1st deadline. Both the Senate and the U.S. House passed the bill in two consecutive days.  However, news of the Lawsuit against Binance brought extreme fear to investors. Bitcoin plunged more than 6% in less than an hour to $25,383. BNB coin dropped 10% while other cryptos hit double-digit losses. Soon after the fear had already spread, further clarification came out that it was Binance.US that was being sued, not the entire Binance company. On this bit of relatively good news, Bitcoin rallied back to its previous price from whence it had fallen ($27,000).  As of the time of writing (10:50 AM UTC+3), Bitcoin is trading at $26,490 and is firmly inside the falling wedge. There is still some room to move before the space runs out and the asset has to decide which direction it wants to move in. We patiently bide our time as we wait for it. The majority of Bitcoin traders are currently only reactive traders, only reacting to the market instead of predicting it. It is understandable, given the huge market-impacting news that drops almost every week out of nowhere with no prior signs. Binance.US has released an official announcement that they will pause USD fiat channels as early as June 13, 2023. This means that they will not accept any USD fiat deposits, and neither will they process USD fiat withdrawals. Consequently, users are advised to withdraw their USD balances via bank transfers by June 13, 2023. Binance.US will become a crypto-only exchange.

2023-06-05 12:00:00+00:00,Bitcoin Price Correction Witnessed Amidst Promising Accumulation Levels,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-correction-witnessed-amidst-promising-accumulation-levels/,"In recent times, Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, has experienced a cooling of its value as the broader crypto market enters a consolidation phase. Despite a bearish outlook, on-chain data suggests a promising accumulation pattern around specific price levels. This analysis provides insights into the recent market trends and highlights the potential impact on future Bitcoin price movements. 📊 There is an interesting dichotomy across the #Bitcoin #Accumulation Trend persists, as the largest of Whales (>10K #BTC) continue to aggressively accumulate, whilst all other groups of traders experience heavy distribution.*@STETRADING* DIRECTLY IN YOUR ACCOUNT 📲 pic.twitter.com/hZ0kIMVp1T As of 3:00 AM (UTC) on Monday, Bitcoin prices are hovering around the $26,800 mark, reflecting a marginal loss of 0.50%. The entire crypto market has entered a consolidation phase, leading to a bearish outlook for the week with a 0.37% loss. Bitcoin struggled to breach the resistance point above $30,000, trading at a low of $25,878.43 in the month that just ended. However, amidst these fluctuations, evidence from on-chain data reveals a distinct accumulation pattern. A crypto analyst going by the name Ali of @Ali_Charts on Twitter highlights a notable accumulation occurring around the price levels of $26,360 and $27,160. Within this range, a significant number of addresses, approximately 2.36 million, purchased a total of 1 million BTC. #Bitcoin | The most important support level for #BTC is now between $26,360 and $27,160, where 2.36 million addresses bought over 1 million $BTC. pic.twitter.com/XoUJecFXRf This recent accumulation suggests a potential price impact in the coming days as market participants begin to realize the significance of this trend according to a report. While the short-term outlook remains bearish, several fundamental factors may support Bitcoin’s price growth in the near future. Firstly, the market received relief when the proposed 30% tax on Bitcoin mining, included in the debt ceiling bill, was blocked. This decision offers leverage to investors who had been hesitant to invest due to unfavorable crypto regulations. Moreover, Bitcoin’s forthcoming halving event, scheduled for April next year, may also influence its price positively. Additionally, the Litecoin Halving, which is expected to occur sooner, could potentially trigger a bullish sentiment in the market, benefiting Bitcoin as well. While impressive price growth is anticipated in June, market experts like Arthur Hayes project that the real rally for this year is more likely to commence in October. Bitcoin’s recent cooling in price and the consolidation phase of the crypto market have raised concerns among investors. However, on-chain data indicating a promising accumulation pattern offers a glimmer of hope for the future. The significant number of addresses purchasing BTC within a specific price range suggests a potential price impact in the coming days. Despite the bearish outlook, there are fundamental factors that could support Bitcoin’s price growth. The blockage of the proposed 30% tax on Bitcoin mining brings relief to investors, enabling them to consider injecting cash back into the coin and the industry. Furthermore, the upcoming halving events, both in Bitcoin and Litecoin, may stimulate positive market sentiment and potentially contribute to Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. It is essential to note that while impressive price growth is anticipated in June, market predictions are subject to external factors and unforeseen events. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and influenced by various elements, such as more regulatory changes, global economic conditions, and investor sentiment. Therefore, it’s crucial for investors to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. Overall, while recent trends and fundamental support offer a positive outlook for Bitcoin’s future price movements, it is essential to approach such predictions with caution. Stay informed, monitor market developments, and consider consulting with financial professionals to make well-informed investment choices in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies."
2023-06-02 09:35:07+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Approaches End Of A Falling Wedge, Breakout To $30k Imminent?",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-approaches-end-of-a-falling-wedge-breakout-to-30k-imminent/,"Bitcoin has shown great resolve in maintaining itself above the $25,000 mark, making many investors remain bullish. With the U.S. House and Senate committees reaching a debt ceiling deal, investors think the markets might just survive for a tad bit longer.  Bitcoin reacted to this news with a +2.58% today and is currently sitting at $27,193. Bitcoin’s expected downward move to around$24,900 did not happen as Bitcoin found new strength on May 25, 2023. The asset rose +8.88% in the span of 4 days and by May 28, BTC had touched $28,468. However, it did not stay at this price for too long.  A massive sell-off ensued from May 29 through to June 1, 2023, as the general market was uncertain about the U.S. debt ceiling deal. On March 29, 2023, BTC entered into a multi-month falling wedge that is now almost coming to a close. Falling wedges have a 63% chance of breaking out to the upside. If Bitcoin breaks out from the chart pattern, expect it to rise +12.84% to $30,252. From there, the $30k level should provide some resistance before BTC makes a decision to either respect it or break through it.On June 2, 2023, Bitcoin saw a sudden spike in price – rising over 2% in a matter of hours.  Bitcoin, and indeed the whole cryptocurrency industry, is a strange asset class. In last week’s analysis, we saw two things: “If they raise the debt ceiling, they have to raise interest rates, which will hurt businesses and Americans. If they don’t raise the debt ceiling, the entire U.S. economy crashes and it will hurt Americans. Either way, there is pain.” On May 31, the House committee passed the Bill to raise the debt ceiling A day later, the US Senate also passed the bill to raise the debt ceiling. According to our previous prediction, one of two things will happen: Interest rates are going to go up, and consequently, Americans and their businesses are going to suffer. On this news, Bitcoin price spiked and might be looking to go up even further as the results of raising the debt ceiling start to manifest upon the nation of America.

2023-05-25 10:51:57+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Tumbles Below $26,500 Support as Fears of US Debt Default Spread to the Markets",https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-tumbles-below-26500-support-as-fears-of-us-debt-default-spread-to-the-markets/,"Will the U.S. default on its debt come June 1? This is the question many are asking. The facts on the ground don’t look so good. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy had unfruitful talks with Biden on May 22, further reinforcing the fears investors have. Yellen has said the stock market may crash by 45%+ if the U.S. defaults. Bitcoin is not reacting well to this news, even though investors believe when an economic crisis happens, BTC will be a safe haven.  Here is a recap of last week’s analysis and the forecast for next week. Bitcoin was holding up well last week due to the support that had formed at the $26,500 range. But as seen in last week’s analysis, the asset was recoiling and preparing to spring either up or down – there was no definite direction. On the upper side, the 50-day EMA was acting as a strong resistance, while on the bottom side, the $26,500 support was not letting up. The tension was building. Bitcoin broke down from the zone of consolidation, a pretty bearish move. The 50-day EMA has been acting as a very effective resistance so far. The bears may have won this round as the BTC price slid below $26,500 and closed the day below this support zone. The next support is at the 200-day EMA, right around $24,900.  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Wednesday that “it seems almost certain” that the United States would not make it past early June without defaulting. In case you are behind the news, the United States is $31.4 trillion in debt (and counting) and it is required to clear this debt before June 1, 2023. However, the government coffers only have about $60 billion (not factoring in government spending – it could be a lot less than that by now). This means if Biden doesn’t sign off on raising the debt ceiling, he will be the first president in American history to default. If the government defaults, a lot of nasty things will happen. Read more about it here: The US Debt Ceiling Crisis And Its Potential Impact On Bitcoin And Other Cryptocurrencies With just a week to go and Biden riddled with international meetings, McCarthy will not be able to meet with Biden again (in person) until after the June 1 deadline. McCarthy confirmed this but also said it was possible they could have conference calls. The outlook is grim for the U.S. If they raise the debt ceiling, they have to raise interest rates, which will hurt businesses and Americans. If they don’t raise the debt ceiling, the entire U.S. economy crashes and it will hurt Americans. Either way, there is pain.  The question is what is in their (the elite’s) best interest?

2023-05-25 08:00:00+00:00,Unraveling The Truth: Challenging The UK Committee Of MPs’ Negative Narrative On Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/unraveling-the-truth-challenging-the-uk-committee-of-mps-negative-narrative-on-bitcoin/,"Cryptocurrencies have always been a topic of debate, and Bitcoin, in particular, has faced its fair share of criticism. Recently, a UK cross-party Committee of MPs released a report questioning the value and purpose of Bitcoin while highlighting concerns about its environmental impact, criminal usage, and risks to consumers. However, a closer examination of these claims reveals a more nuanced reality. In this article, we will challenge the key assertions made by the Committee and shed light on the potential benefits and advancements that cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, can offer. Time to regulate cryptocurrency? Chair of the Treasury Select Committee @hbaldwin thinks so – here's why 👇#KayBurley FC pic.twitter.com/JzGCIVO5a7 The Committee raised concerns about Bitcoin’s energy consumption, comparing it to entire countries. While it is true that Bitcoin mining requires electricity, it is crucial to put this into perspective. Bitcoin’s energy usage, although substantial, needs to be balanced against the benefits it brings to financial innovation, particularly in facilitating cross-border transactions and promoting financial inclusion. Moreover, the Bitcoin network continues to evolve, with various initiatives actively working on reducing its environmental impact through the adoption of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. The Committee’s report claimed that cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are extensively used by criminals for scams, fraud, and money laundering. While it is undeniable that illicit activities occur within the crypto space, it is important to note that traditional banking systems also face similar challenges. The technology underlying cryptocurrencies, such as blockchain, actually has the potential to enhance transparency and traceability, making it easier to identify and mitigate fraudulent activities. Moreover, regulatory efforts are underway to address these concerns and ensure a safer environment for consumers and businesses operating in the crypto industry. The report suggested that the price volatility of cryptocurrencies makes retail trading akin to gambling rather than a financial service. While it is true that cryptocurrencies can experience significant price fluctuations, this is not unique to the crypto market. Traditional financial markets also witness volatility, with stocks, commodities, and currencies experiencing fluctuations. In fact, volatility can present opportunities for traders and investors alike. Additionally, as the crypto market matures and regulations are put in place, mechanisms to mitigate risk and protect consumers will be established, creating a more stable and secure trading environment. The Committee expressed concern that regulating consumer crypto trading as a financial service would create a “halo” effect, leading consumers to believe that this activity is safe and protected when it is not. While the Committee’s concern is valid, it is essential to view regulation as a means to establish standards and safeguards rather than as an endorsement of risk-free investing. Effective regulation is needed to protect consumers from harm and ensure fair and transparent practices within the crypto industry. By implementing clear guidelines, conducting thorough due diligence on platforms, and providing investor education, regulators can strike a balance between consumer protection and fostering innovation. It is important to recognize that not all cryptocurrencies are the same, and this distinction is particularly applicable to Bitcoin. While the Committee’s report criticized cryptocurrencies in general, it is essential to understand the unique characteristics and value propositions of individual digital assets. Bitcoin, as the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, has paved the way for the entire industry. Its decentralized nature, based on a peer-to-peer network and blockchain technology, offers transparency, immutability, and security. The digital currency’s scarcity, with a maximum supply of 21 million coins, adds to its appeal as a store of value. Comparing Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies is akin to comparing apples to oranges. Each digital asset has its own purpose, technology, and community of users. While some cryptocurrencies may lack intrinsic value or practical applications, Bitcoin’s role as a decentralized digital currency and a potential hedge against inflation has gained significant recognition and adoption. Regulatory measures and scrutiny should consider this differentiation among cryptocurrencies. Blanket statements that disregard the unique qualities of Bitcoin may hinder its potential positive impact on the financial landscape. Despite its criticisms, the Committee acknowledged the potential benefits of the technologies underlying cryptocurrencies, particularly in cross-border transactions and financial services for underdeveloped countries. It is essential to embrace these opportunities for progress and innovation while simultaneously implementing necessary regulations to ensure consumer protection. The advent of central bank digital currencies, including the potential introduction of a “digital pound” by the Bank of England, demonstrates the recognition of the transformative power of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in revolutionizing financial systems. While the Committee of MPs expressed concerns regarding cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin, it is crucial to critically examine their claims. Its energy consumption, criminal usage, and price volatility should be seen in a broader context that includes potential benefits and advancements. As the crypto industry matures and regulatory frameworks evolve, a balance can be struck to ensure consumer protection, promote innovation, and harness the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies in the financial landscape."
2023-05-22 04:00:00+00:00,Ran Neuner Goes To Dump His Altcoin Holdings In Favor Of Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/ran-neuner-goes-to-dump-his-altcoin-holdings-in-favor-of-bitcoin/,"In a surprising turn of events, prominent South African crypto influencer Ran Neuner has recently made a bold decision that has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community. Convinced by Bitcoin’s growing potential and recent technical advances, he just revealed his decision to liquidate his altcoin holdings and shift his focus solely to the world’s oldest and most popular cryptocurrency. This strategic move reflects his belief in Bitcoin’s dominance in the upcoming bull market. Let’s delve into the reasons behind Neuner’s choice and the implications it may have for the crypto landscape. Alt Season Has Been Cancelled: Ran Neuner Prepares To Dump All Altcoin Bags In Favor of Bitcoinhttps://t.co/BnRJMD3bkP #cryptocurrency #blockchain #cryptonews Neuner, the host of Crypto Banter and CEO of Onchain Capital, anticipates a future riddled with economic collapses and escalating geopolitical tensions. He believes that in such uncertain times, investors will seek refuge in secure assets. Drawing a parallel with traditional safe-haven gold, Neuner argues that Bitcoin is poised to surpass it as a preferred store of value. The recent surge in gold prices suggests that investors are already bracing themselves for potential governmental missteps. While gold has long been regarded as a safe haven, Neuner highlights a crucial limitation: its lack of on-chain verifiability. Governments and central banks may claim to possess substantial gold reserves, but without concrete on-chain proof, these claims remain unverifiable. The crypto investor theorizes that a government or central bank mishap involving gold could trigger a significant shift in investor behavior, leading them to flock to Bitcoin, which offers the advantage of being verifiable on-chain. Beyond Bitcoin’s appeal as a safe haven, Neuner is enthralled by its recent evolution and technical advancements. He specifically points to the launch of Ordinals, which has enhanced Bitcoin’s functionality, making it a strong competitor to Ethereum. The ability to issue tokens, run smart contracts, and the introduction of a Bitcoin virtual machine has revolutionized the crypto landscape. Neuner sees immense potential in the infrastructure being built around Bitcoin, making it a more promising investment prospect compared to smaller altcoins. While Neuner’s decision to focus solely on Bitcoin is fueled by optimism, he acknowledges the challenges that lie ahead. Scalability remains a crucial concern for Bitcoin, and addressing it will be vital for the cryptocurrency’s sustained growth. Nonetheless, the crypto analyst advises investors to accumulate “dry powder” or investable cash in preparation for the impending revolution. He cautions against waiting, as other token prices might decline while Bitcoin and its associated tokens experience a surge. Neuner’s advice is clear: embrace Bitcoin and its burgeoning ecosystem now to maximize the potential benefits. The paradigm shift of Ran Neuner from altcoins to Bitcoin underscores the rapidly changing dynamics in the crypto market. Motivated by Bitcoin’s verifiability, its evolution as a competitor to Ethereum, and the robust infrastructure being built around it, Neuner sees a bright future for the leading cryptocurrency. While challenges remain, Neuner’s decision resonates with a growing sentiment that Bitcoin is positioned to dominate the narrative of the next bull market. As investors witness this shift, the crypto landscape is poised for further transformation, with Bitcoin at the forefront of this exciting revolution."
2023-05-19 10:28:38+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Finds Support at $26k As Tether Plans To Blow Billions In Profits On BTC,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-price-finds-support-at-26k-as-tether-plans-to-blow-billions-in-profits-on-btc/,"The markets have been slow this week, causing Bitcoin to mostly move sideways. This should have been a fruitful week for leverage traders since a sideways market presents lucrative opportunities bolstered by high leverage to make profits.  However, can we make the same claim for next week? Let’s dive into BTC analysis. After a sharp fall in Bitcoin price last week, the asset began to trend below the 50-day EMA – a bearish signal. We expected Bitcoin to drop down further and head for the 200-day EMA which would act as a major support. Hopefully, BTC would bounce off of this support indicator and head for new highs.  Bitcoin found support at $26,500 and refused to drop to $24,000. This is a good thing as it shows the bulls still have power. Despite this unprecedented support, Bitcoin still did not break above the 50-day EMA. In fact, this indicator is now acting as an overhead resistance for Bitcoin.  Between the 50-day EMA indicator and the $26,500 support, BTC has a tiny space to move. You could say Bitcoin is recoiling and we don’t know in which direction it will spring.  Bitcoin might spring upwards given that now Tether, the company behind USDT has announced they will be investing 15% of their profits in Bitcoin monthly starting May 2023. Tether🧡#BitcoinStarting this month, Tether will regularly allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits towards purchasing Bitcoin. These Bitcoin shall be considered on top of the minimum reserves assets that 100% back tether tokens.More 👉 https://t.co/7zC2swgwWH pic.twitter.com/BOcSDjjmDf While Tether has been in the limelight for not having its assets 100% fully backed, they have continued to assert that they are actually 100% backed with $2.5B in excess of reserves. According to an official Tether blog post, the company held about $1.5B worth of Bitcoin in its reserves. The company is also invested in Gold. It is sufficient to assume that such a company with excess reserves is highly profitable. 15% of $2.5B is $375 million. All that money going into Bitcoin would raise it a few thousand dollars."

This special event, which signifies the monumental growth and acceptance of digital currencies since the inception of the first-ever Bitcoin transaction, will be marked by vibrant community meet-ups across the globe. Let’s delve into the exciting details of this global festivity. To celebrate #Bitcoin Pizza Day, we're kicking off a series of #BinancePizza events worldwide!Here’s some of what you can look forward to:🔸 Pizza🔸 Giveaways🔸 #Binance merch🔸 And much more!But which countries are we heading to? Find out here 👇 pic.twitter.com/RoZlNhYYaY The Bitcoin Pizza Day occasion pays homage to the groundbreaking event that marked the first-ever documented real-world exchange using Bitcoin. It took place on May 22, 2010, when a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz purchased two pizzas for 10,000 BTCs. This transaction is considered a significant milestone in the history of cryptocurrencies, as it marked one of the earliest instances of Bitcoin being used as a medium of exchange for a tangible good. The event gained prominence over time, symbolizing the value and potential of cryptocurrencies and highlighting their evolving role in everyday transactions. Bitcoin Pizza Day serves as a reminder of the exponential growth and acceptance of digital currencies since that groundbreaking transaction. Nestled in the picturesque city of Naples, Italy, where pizza originated, Binance’s festivities will kick off on May 21, honoring the day that forever altered the cryptocurrency landscape. According to a report, the celebration will extend beyond Italy’s borders, with vibrant pizza-themed events taking place in ten countries, including Brazil, Bahrain, Pakistan, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Uruguay, Mexico, Argentina, and New Zealand. Binance plans to infuse the crypto theme into the universally adored delicacy, taking over local pizzerias and pizza vans for an unforgettable experience. Not only can cryptocurrency enthusiasts join the physical meet-ups, but the global crypto community is also invited to partake in the festivities virtually through popular social media platforms and the Binance app. By sharing their creative Binance-themed pizzas using the hashtag #BinancePizza or successfully collecting all the delectable Pizza Flavors in the Binance app, participants stand a chance to win an incredible prize – the crypto equivalent of a year’s supply of pizza. The online celebration will culminate on May 22 with an electrifying virtual live meet-up, featuring none other than Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and prominent Binance Feed creators. Together, they will engage in an interactive session, exploring the enduring significance of Bitcoin Pizza Day, delving into its profound impact on the cryptocurrency industry, and reflecting on its extraordinary journey toward mass adoption. Binance views Bitcoin Pizza Day as a powerful symbol of the unity and resilience of the cryptocurrency community, as well as the growing acceptance of Bitcoin in everyday life. Yi He, co-founder and CMO of Binance, emphasizes the exchange’s dedication to promoting mass adoption and creating practical use cases for cryptocurrencies in daily transactions. Each Pizza Day event organized by Binance promises an array of engaging activities, rewards, and opportunities to win exclusive Binance merchandise. For instance, the first 500 attendees at the Naples event will savor “Binance-style” pizza and drinks while participating in a thrilling pizza-making contest for a chance to win exciting Binance prizes. Bitcoin Pizza Day represents a significant milestone in the evolution of the cryptocurrency industry. It serves as a testament to the remarkable growth and influence of digital currencies over the past 13 years. Binance remains steadfast in its mission to enhance financial freedom through rising crypto adoption, firmly believing that it will unlock endless opportunities for individuals worldwide. Reflecting on the past, from the moment when a mere 10,000 BTC could buy just a single pizza, to witnessing the astronomical value of a single unit today, we’re reminded of the incredible growth and acceptance of digital currencies in the annual Bitcoin Pizza Day. It’s a testament to the unstoppable evolution of the crypto world where possibilities are seemingly limitless and traditional boundaries are shattered."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2023-05-12 07:57:15+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Turns Bearish As BRC-20 Token Exert Stress On The Network,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-turns-bearish-as-brc-20-token-exert-stress-on-the-network/,"Bitcoin price has turned red and investors become restless. There is nothing sustaining Bitcoin price above $10k, yet the asset has refused to come down. Investors are wary of the day those propping up the price will decide to drop it. BRC-20 tokens have become famous, but their fame has left the Bitcoin network in utter tension and stress. The network is now almost unusable. Let’s see how Bitcoin may fare next week. Last week, Bitcoin received some bullish news – the fall of PacWest Bank. When banks fail Bitcoin rises. However, the macro-chart analyzed last week showed Bitcoin found a strong resistance between $31k and $35k. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $26,349. It is likely the bear market bottom was around $15k, but if you have been keen since this year began, the aura of ‘unusual’ has been hanging heavily upon the markets (both traditional and digital). Legacy banking migrated to a new messaging standard – the ISO20022. The last time a change of this magnitude happened was 100 years ago. Besides that, major banks have been failing left right, and center, yet this news has never hit the mainstream media – is it being intentionally suppressed? More top officials have been implicated in drug and human trafficking rings, Pedophilia, and corruption in the last three months than in the last decade, yet you have never heard it in the news. Something is definitely going down. The Z-score indicator that flashes green or red when the price of Bitcoin rises too high or low below the zero-line (base), flashed red on May 10, 2023. The indicator works with the Crypto Fear and Greed indicator to show points where the market is at maximum greed or fear. If the market is greedy, you sell, and if it’s fearful, you buy. Since Wednesday, Bitcoin price fell sharply from $28,282 to $26,800. Until it flashes green again, investors should expect Bitcoin price to continue falling. The price of Bitcoin also closed below the 50-day EMA (green line), a bearish indicator. The curve (blue) has acted as a support previously – but not today. Bitcoin slashed right through this support and is headed for the 200-day EMA (white line). This is a major support, as you can see (blue rectangle). Investors and traders should expect the 200-day EMA to hold the falling BTC price. BTC leverage traders can make a quick 25% – 50% profit if they short BTC now with 5X to 10X leverage.

2023-05-09 12:00:00+00:00,Crypto-Forward: Liechtenstein May Soon Accept Bitcoin For State Services,https://blockzeit.com/crypto-forward-liechtenstein-may-soon-accept-bitcoin-for-state-services/,"Liechtenstein is looking to accept Bitcoin as payment for state services. The Prime Minister, Daniel Risch, has expressed plans to implement this move, potentially following neighboring country Switzerland.  Liechtenstein, one of Europe’s smallest countries, may soon be joining its neighbor, Switzerland, in accepting Bitcoin for payment services.  The announcement was made by the current Prime Minister, Daniel Risch, who stated that Bitcoin payment options “are coming.” According to reports by Handelsblatt, a German-based media outlet, Risch plans to make Bitcoin a payment option for state services such as taxes and public services. The move will put Liechtenstein in the forefront of countries that are embracing cryptocurrencies as a payment method. Public services that may soon be available for payment with Bitcoin which may include utilities, transportation, education, and healthcare services, among others. The move is expected to make it easier for citizens and businesses in Liechtenstein to pay for services without the need for traditional banking services. Liechtenstein’s neighbor, Switzerland, has already embraced Bitcoin for payment services, and this may have influenced Liechtenstein’s decision to follow suit.  In fact, Switzerland’s largest online retailer, Digitec Galaxus, has been accepting Bitcoin payments since 2019, and a growing number of Swiss retailers and service providers have followed suit. While Risch acknowledges that crypto assets like Bitcoin carry inherent risk, he believes that it has the potential to change the financial landscape. He sees the potential for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to revolutionize industries like banking, finance, and investment. Liechtenstein has been proactive in recognizing the potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. The country passed a legal framework for cryptocurrency and blockchain in 2019, called the Blockchain Act. The bill served to recognize blockchain technology and define how it works in a legal framework, allowing it to have a role in future policy. The move towards accepting Bitcoin for state services is just one step in Liechtenstein’s broader plan to embrace blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. It is a progressive move that may put Liechtenstein ahead of other countries in Europe that are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Liechtenstein’s move to accept Bitcoin for state services is an exciting development that will put the country in the forefront of countries that are embracing cryptocurrencies. It will make it easier for citizens and businesses to pay for services without the need for traditional banking services. With its legal framework for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, Liechtenstein is well-positioned to lead the way in this new and exciting industry."
2023-05-08 06:00:00+00:00,"What’s Next For Bitcoin And The Market After The Last Fed Hike, Inflation, And Banking Woes?",https://blockzeit.com/whats-next-for-bitcoin-and-the-market-after-the-last-fed-hike-inflation-and-banking-woes/,"Last Wednesday, the Federal Reserve declared an increase in the federal funds rate, raising it between 5% and 5.25%. This marks the first time since 2007 that the rate has been raised by 25 basis points. Although the Fed hike was widely anticipated, it was announced amid a series of bank failures that have occurred in recent months, raising doubts about the stability of the banking system and significant movement in Bitcoin (BTC) values. 🚨 FED HIKE RATE BY 25 BPS 🚨 During the recent months, several banks including First Republic and Silicon Valley Bank had to be taken over by regulators. Meanwhile, Signature and Silvergate had to be liquidated voluntarily due to their exposure to cryptocurrencies. JPMorgan had to intervene and buy First Republic, while Silicon Valley Bank was seized after comments from its CEO triggered a bank run. Despite timing the Fed hike during these events, the Federal Reserve has been monitoring the situation closely, with its chairman Jerome Powell assuring that the banking system remains “sound and resilient”. The Federal Reserve aims to maintain a 2% inflation target rate, which is also the target rate for fed funds. Although inflation is showing signs of slowing down, it remains at a high level to this point. According to the consumer price index, annual inflation rose by 5% in the 12 months ending in March, down slightly from the 6% reported in February. The Fed has not indicated any further rate hikes and suggests a potential pause. Powell emphasized that the Fed is ready to take action if needed and that their decision will be based on incoming data and events that unfold. It should be noted that Powell has been using the term “soft landing” to describe the Fed’s goal of lowering inflation without causing a recession or economic crisis. If the Fed cuts rates by the end of 2023, it is likely that this has already been factored into the market, and there is a good chance the Fed will be able to achieve a soft landing, allowing financial markets to continue growing according to YouHodler Chief of Markets Ruslan Lienkha’s email to Blockworks. On the other hand, eToro’s investment analyst, Callie Cox stated via a May 3 tweet that Bitcoin’s performance has been impressive in the last 7 out of 10 Fed days during the past 14 months. During those seven instances mentioned, it has outperformed the stock market. A look at how stocks, bonds and Bitcoin have performed since rate hikes beganSomething I pointed out to @eToroUS clients: $BTC has led the stock market in seven out of the last 10 Fed days 💥 pic.twitter.com/QMMozvieZO In a related statement by Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata crypto analytics firm, he noted that Bitcoin has been largely driven by macroeconomic events. The analyst explained that a 25 basis point Fed hike has already been priced in, so it is unlikely to trigger any significant reaction. However, any indication of a pause in rate hikes going forward could be positive for the crypto and may push it slightly higher, potentially reaching the $29K to $30K mark. The Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates for the first time since 2007 amidst bank collapses and inflation concerns reflects the economic uncertainties facing the US economy. However, the government agency has signaled a potential pause in further Fed hikes and will be closely monitoring incoming data to determine its future policy actions. As the market braces for a possible soft landing, the performance of Bitcoin, which has outperformed the stock market on most Fed days, remains an important indicator of the macroeconomic landscape. There are many other factors that could potentially impact the movement of BTC though, beyond the ones mentioned in the article. Some of these factors include further government regulations, adoption rates by businesses and individuals, the emergence of competing cryptocurrencies, and geopolitical events such as economic sanctions or political instability in major countries. Furthermore, investor sentiment and market psychology can also play a significant role in the movement of BTC and other cryptocurrencies."
2023-05-05 07:52:51+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Remains Strong As Pacwest Crashes 54% In Less Than 48 Hours,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-remains-strong-as-pacwest-crashes-54-in-less-than-48-hours/,"The banks are at it again as several of the largest banks in the U.S. show signs of going extinct. First Republic Bank completely crashed and JP Morgan put in a bid to buy it up. PacWest Bank is next.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin has been strong, riding on the news of global financial and banking collapse. Even when Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, raised rates by 25BPS on May 3, Bitcoin still continued to go up. This makes you wonder whether there is some manipulation going on. Let’s find out. Bitcoin is not following normal technicals since the price is heavily manufactured and manipulated. However, the 50-day remained healthy support (green line) and the price bounced off of this indicator.There need to be events (probably another bank crash) to push BTC upwards and help it break $31k. If we manage to break above this resistance, Bitcoin can easily rise to $36k. It’s no surprise that Bitcoin is running into resistance here at the blue band as it has done five times previously in the past two cycles. This is a just but temporary roadblock. This indicator (the bands) called the last April 2021 top in real-time. The current price of the upper red band sets the next Bitcoin top at $106,000. The big picture for Bitcoin is that it is still as bullish as ever. Just take a look at the Golden Ratio Multiplier. The golden 350 DMA cross has occurred, and we still have yet to see a return to the green or red lines which happens after every cross. Only patience will get us there!

2023-04-28 09:53:43+00:00,Market wrap – Bitcoin Rebounds As It Prepares To Test $35K,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-rebounds-as-it-prepare-to-test-35000/,"Bitcoin has had an eventful Q1, and heading into the second month of Q2, the trend seems to remain the same. Trading at $29,000, traders need to pay close attention to the “psychological” $30,000 level which could determine whether the momentum of Bitcoin’s upward trajectory can be sustained.  The USA vs BRICS war continues to rage on as the date of the eventual Operation Sandman looms – the long-awaited death of the dollar as the global reserve currency. Bitcoin has been riding on these and more rumors, but can it sustain the trend upwards? Let’s find out. In the previous analysis, the 200-day EMA is a significant indicator when analyzing Bitcoin’s daily and weekly timeframes. On April 20, 2023, Bitcoin fell to a low of $28,005 and continues to decline. If the $28k support level fails, the next reliable support level would be around $24,000, representing an 11% decrease from the current price. It is important to note that the 200-day EMA can act as support or resistance depending on the price’s position. Therefore, it could potentially support BTC around the $24,000 area. This implies that the narrative for a $24K BTC in the upcoming weeks is plausible. However, a negative fundamental development could trigger a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s value. It is advisable to conduct thorough research and analysis before making investment decisions and to diversify one’s portfolio to mitigate risk. The price of Bitcoin is on a rebound after dropping from its psychological resistance at $31500. The price is still bullish, even though the resistance at 31000 seems strong enough to push the price down to its previous support level. However, the 200-day and 50-day moving averages also signal the price increases after the shortfall. The 50-day moving average also acts as a support for the Bitcoin price. Next week’s analysis indicates that the price will return to support before the bulls push the price high above the resistance level, after which the price is expected to hit the $38000 resistance level. Bitcoin’s value may reach $100,000 by the end of 2024. The collapse of some US banks has strengthened the argument for Bitcoin as a trustworthy and scarce digital asset. The report suggests that Bitcoin’s market share may increase from 45% to 50-60% in the coming months. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $29,686.55 at press time with a 24-hour trading volume of $30,095,687,457. In the last 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin has increased by 7.16%, and in the past 7 days, it has increased by 2.93%. With a circulating supply of 19 million BTC, its market cap is valued at $574,667,454,066.

2023-04-21 08:32:13+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Finds Support at $28,000 as More Countries Prepare to Launch CBDCs",https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-finds-support-at-28000-as-more-countries-prepare-to-launch-cbdcs/,"Bitcoin has experienced a sharp downturn from its recent high of $31,000 and is now trading at barely above $28,000. The reason for the drop has been attributed to one trader (or investor) who sold off $400M worth of Bitcoin in one go. Other than that Bitcoin remains strong. Let’s see what next week holds for this asset Last week, Bitcoin broke through the 28k resistance level and continued to rise toward $31,840. There was speculation about whether BTC would retrace or continue to rise toward the $34,000 mark. However, this week the asset has received some heavy selling pressure from bears.  Currently, Bitcoin sits at $28,016. This is an important zone because it was previously the resistance. If everything goes well, $28,000 might become the new support. If this is the case Bitcoin could bounce off of this support and launch to higher highs. The 200-EMA (green line) is very important in analyzing Daily and weekly timeframes. Bitcoin dropped to a low of $28,005 on April 20, 2023, and continues to sink deeper. The next reliable support for Bitcoin, if $28k fails, will be $24,000. This, unfortunately, will present an 11% drop from the current price. The 200-day EMA also acts as a support or resistance depending on where the price is. In this case, it can act as support for BTC around the $24,000 area. Therefore, the narrative for a $24K BTC in the coming weeks is in play. What is needed is a piece of negative fundamental news to launch BTC off the cliff. On the off chance (nothing is really left to chance – it’s all manipulation ????) that $28K support holds, the path to $52,000 has been charted (red path). There is a somewhat strong barrier around $35,000 – $36,000 which could present some resistance. However, the behavior of BTC when it reaches that price all depends on the state of the global financial arena and the power of the bulls. It is also worth noting that Bitcoin is currently sitting at the 50-day moving average, relatively strong support as well.  DISCLAIMER: The work included in this article is based on current events, technical charts, company news releases, and the author’s opinions.

2023-04-14 10:01:15+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Smashes $30k As CPI Data Comes In Lower than Expected,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-smashes-30k-as-cpi-data-comes-in-lower-than-expected/,"The week has been hot, as have been all the other weeks this year 2023. This week particularly had investors on their toes, anticipating the CPI data that came out on April 12, 2023.  Well, the CPI data came out lower than the market expected and Bitcoin in turn took off, breaking $30,000. A lower CPI shows that the inflation rate is going down. What will Bitcoin pull off next week? Let’s consult the charts. Last week, Bitcoin continued to trend in a tight range leaving no clues as to whether it was going to go up or down. Despite this uncertainty, bulls remained relatively optimistic since the asset remained above the 200-day and 50-day moving averages. Furthermore, the asset was trading well above the Golden Cross that had formed a few weeks prior.  All Bitcoin needed was some bit of good news to push it out of the consolidation zone. It is also worth mentioning that consolidation contributed to the formation of a bullish flag, which further incited more hopium among Bitcoin bulls. Bitcoin received some good news with the CPI data and took off on a massive candle. The asset finally broke above the $28,000 barrier which had become quite a stubborn resistance in the past couple of weeks. Now that Bitcoin has broken the 28k resistance, the rise won’t be complete before it touches $31,840. Therefore, there is still some room to move. After that, it is decision time again. Will BTC retrace or will the bulls provide enough power to smash through that resistance and make for the $34,000 mark? That remains to be seen next week. The mother of all breakouts happened this week. #Bitcoin smashed successfully through two years bear market resistance and entered in pre bullrun phase.Glory to those who listened and bought with me between 16-18k at historic lows, now make sure not to sell below ATH. pic.twitter.com/TnbEeYvgEM While some are rejoicing that the bull market is back, a long-overlooked Black Swan event written about in these analyses will still happen. The fact that it has not happened only means smart money is delaying the inevitable. It is pretty difficult to predict where Bitcoin will go, even if the chart says ‘up’ mainly because times are different. In an age where your typical ‘breaking news’ comprises of war threats between China/Russia and the U.S.A, it is wise to make very conservative predictions or remain on the sidelines altogether. The United States economy is in shambles, and the dollar is barely holding on to its status as a reserve currency.  Rumors have it that the famous pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, is actually the name of a group of four individuals, who are well-known and in bed with the U.S. government.  I FOUND THE CREATORS OF BITCOIN. pic.twitter.com/22AxNT5njB If this is the case and their identity is exposed (confirmed) to and by the public, Bitcoin could receive a huge blow to its decentralized status.

2023-04-10 10:00:00+00:00,"MicroStrategy Increases Crypto Holdings By 1,045 Bitcoin",https://blockzeit.com/microstrategy-increases-crypto-holdings-by-1045-bitcoin/,"The recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing of MicroStrategy (MSTR) as well as its co-founder and executive chairman revealed that the company just increased its cryptocurrency holdings by another 1,045 Bitcoin. The amount translates to around $23.9 million, raising the overall crypto balance sheet of MSTR to 140,000 BTC or an estimated $4 billion. Is this another sign of more things to come in the world’s oldest crypto in circulation? MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 1,045 #bitcoin for ~ $29.3M at an average price of $28,016 per bitcoin. As of 4/4/2023 @MicroStrategy holds 140,000 bitcoin acquired for ~$4.17 billion at an average price of $29,803 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/IBufTxalnv As shown in the tweet above, MSTR co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor informed the public last April 5 of the company’s recent Bitcoin acquisition and the status of its crypto funds. According to him, the average price of Bitcoin during the purchase made on the previous day was $28,016 per coin. This puts the average BTC purchases of the analytics platform at $29,803 per coin. MicroStrategy specializes in analytics, mobile software, and cloud-based services. The company was founded in 1989 by Saylor. Since then, it has become one of the world’s leading providers of enterprise analytics and mobility solutions. According to its website, MicroStrategy’s primary goal is to help organizations make better decisions by providing them with actionable insights from gathered data. Its platform enables users to analyze large amounts of information quickly and easily, allowing them to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities that they may have otherwise missed. With MicroStrategy, businesses can transform data into actionable intelligence and make informed decisions that drive growth, improve efficiency, and reduce costs. One of the key features of MicroStrategy’s platform is its ability to deliver insights to users regardless of their location or device. The company’s mobile software allows users to access critical business information from anywhere, at any time, on any device. This capability has become increasingly important as more and more employees work remotely or from different locations. Another important aspect of MicroStrategy’s platform is its ability to integrate with other systems and applications. This means that users can connect their data sources, such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM) or Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, to the platform, enabling them to analyze and report on all of their data in one place. MicroStrategy also provides cloud-based services, allowing users to deploy and manage their analytics and mobility solutions in cloud storage. This provides businesses with flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, as they can easily scale their solutions up or down as their needs change. Overall, MicroStrategy’s platform is designed to provide organizations with the tools they need to turn their data into valuable insights. With its advanced analytics, mobile capabilities, and cloud-based services, MicroStrategy is well-positioned to help businesses stay ahead of the competition in today’s data-driven world. The latest development is a significant move that signals MicroStrategy’s continued confidence in the cryptocurrency. By increasing its Bitcoin assets, it is essentially doubling down on its bet that the coin will continue to appreciate in value over the long term. The move is also likely to have a positive impact on the broader Bitcoin market, as it reinforces the growing trend of institutional investors and corporations adding the digital coin to their balance sheets. As more companies like MicroStrategy invest in it, it is likely to experience an increase in demand, which will eventually help drive up its price. In addition to the positive impact on Bitcoin, MicroStrategy’s move is a sign of the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the mainstream financial industry. With a growing number of companies and institutions investing in Bitcoin, it is becoming increasingly clear that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are likely to play an important role in the future of finance. It is worth noting that cryptocurrencies remain a highly volatile asset class, and investing in them carries significant risks. While MicroStrategy’s move may be a positive development for Bitcoin, investors should always be aware of the risks involved and should carefully plan their investment strategies before putting their money in cryptocurrencies."
2023-04-07 09:21:04+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Breaks Above $28k As Binance Receives Billion-Dollar Class-Action Lawsuit,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-breaks-above-28k-as-binance-receives-billion-dollar-class-action-lawsuit/,"Finally, Bitcoin has broken and is trending above the $28,000 level after consolidating for several days due to volatility and price swings. But can it hold above this range? On Wednesday, Bitcoin experienced a sharp climb as investors disregarded their initial concerns about U.S. regulators cracking down on major players in the industry and instead showed a willingness to take on some risk. At press time, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $28,057.26 with a 24-hour trading volume of  $13,498,257,130. However, the price has decreased by -0.04% in the last 24 hours and -1.17% in the past seven days. Its market cap is $542,593,138,101, based on its circulating supply of 19 million BTC. In the previous analysis, the BTC price at $26,000 had become a psychological support for Bitcoin, while $29,000 remained a strong resistance. Additionally, the market was awaiting the finalization of the Ripple lawsuit, and a ruling was expected to be made in April. Despite this, Bitcoin was still trending above its 200-day and 50-day moving averages and had confirmed its bottom following the golden cross. For those who missed the opportunity to buy between $15,000 and $24,000, securing a position before BTC breaks $30,000 may be a wise decision. If the bulls continue to push the price higher, the following targets for Bitcoin are $32,000 (target 1) and $38,000 (target 2). Bitcoin continues to maintain its upward trend above both the 200-day and 50-day moving averages. A golden cross signaled the end of the bearish market, and Bitcoin confirmed its bottom shortly after that, leading to an upward trajectory. However, the price is still in the consolidation phase. After breaking above the $28000 level, the price of BTC still lingers around the zone, unable to move up to break the resistance level. The bulls however show an aggressive measure to push the price above $30000, resistance. If this should take place a short bull run to the $35000 resistance zone will be inevitable. The relative strength index also indicates signs of a bull run in the coming weeks as it is trading above 50. In the coming week, BTC should break above the resistance zone achieving a $35000 target.

2023-04-06 08:00:00+00:00,Bitcoin Thesis Becomes Best Seller On Amazon,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-thesis-becomes-best-seller-on-amazon/,"Amidst the ongoing discussion regarding Bitcoin’s geopolitical consequences, the graduate thesis of U.S. Space Force major Jason Lowery has unexpectedly become a top-selling book on Amazon, surpassing even the most popular works of fiction. This Bitcoin thesis has now risen to the top of Amazon’s bestseller lists and categories. The United States Space Force Major, Jason Lowery, wrote a wordy academic paper on Bitcoin, which has become Amazon’s best seller. In the paper titled “Softwar: A Novel Theory on Power Projection and the National Strategic Significance of Bitcoin,” Lowery expresses his strong support for Bitcoin as a military-grade solution for gathering information and its potential to play a major role in the world’s geopolitical stage.  The paper explains the completion of academic research Lowery conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during a six-month fellowship backed by the Department of Defense, and the current use of Bitcoin’s network for monetary purposes is conceptually distinct from its intended purpose. Lowrey advised several senior US executives on Bitcoin-associated regulations in the offices of the President, Secretary of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as stated in his concise description on Amazon. Lowery’s search for Bitcoin has achieved the number one position in Amazon’s virtual currencies classification and is presently ranked second in both books on technology and engineering, even though softwar does not hold a rank among the top 500 books listed on Amazon’s store. The book elaborates on Lowery’s Power Projection Theory, drawing on knowledge from several domains, including anthropology and computer science. In the book, Lowery effectively describes how military powers can use the proof-of-work system underlying Bitcoin transaction verification to establish restrictions on bad actors of which the work involved in processing data often involves strenuous physical effort, though it is not harmful to the individuals performing the task. The book also states that Bitcoin technology can serve as a military-grade solution for storing and securing data. If 21st-century cyber warfare employs Bitcoin as a modern gun, it would establish a new cause for the top digital asset. The paperback version of “Softwar: A Novel Theory on Power Projection and the National Strategic Significance of Bitcoin” has a price tag of $35.99 and enjoys an almost perfect rating of 4.9 out of 5 stars. The 365-page-long read presents the “Power Projection Theory,” which asserts how Bitcoin technology can serve as an electro-cyber-defense protocol. According to the theory, Bitcoin possesses a significant advantage over software, as it can physically constrain a computer, unlike algorithmic software. Major Lowery, in his paper, suggests that if the United States government doesn’t hold enough Bitcoin reserves, it could pose a threat to national security. This #Bitcoin thesis book by Major Jason P. Lowery becomes Amazon's best seller!Let the people know about #BTC , then they decide! 🔥#Softwar #Crypto pic.twitter.com/n6kkt13B9O Since Lowrey published his thesis in February and the United States announced the sale of $215 Million in confiscated Bitcoin last month, it appears that not many Fed members are giving much attention to his hypothesis. In the acknowledgments section of the book, some well-known supporters of Bitcoin, such as Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy and Peter McCormack, are mentioned. Major Jason Lowery’s graduate thesis on Bitcoin, which advocates for its military-grade potential for information gathering and its use in geopolitics, has unexpectedly become a best-selling book on Amazon, highlighting the growing interest and potential for Bitcoin beyond its current monetary applications."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2023-03-31 12:00:00+00:00,Market Wrap: Can Bitcoin Break $30k Amid Global Economy De-Dollarization?,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-can-bitcoin-break-30k-amid-global-economy-de-dollarization/,"Bitcoin has been struggling to break above $29,000 in the recent past. In the past two weeks, BTC has tried to break this level twice. It has touched this level but wasn’t able to sustain above the price. Many fundamental events including “de-dollarization” are driving Bitcoin’s price. Can BTC break above $30k on its third try? Let’s dive in. Last week, the markets witnessed the effect of the banking system falling. While other banks are still falling on the verge of falling , global elites have managed to shift the news towards the agenda of “de-dollarization”.  Bitcoin had reached $28,000 and found resistance at that level. From there, Bitcoin could have retraced back to the upper trend line of the rising wedge at around $27,000 or back to the top of the range at about $25,200. If it had broken above $28,000, Bitcoin would have risen to $33,000, which also happened to be the next resistance. $26,000 has become a psychological support for Bitcoin on its move higher. While $29k remains an adamant resistance. As we enter into April, the market expects the Ripple lawsuit to be finalized and a ruling to be made today. It was the general opinion of many that March would be the end of the two-year long court battle. Apart from that, Bitcoin still remains trending above the 200-day and 50-day moving averages. Immediately after the golden cross, Bitcoin confirmed the bottom was in and began moving higher. For long term holders, buying anywhere between $15k and $24k was buying the bottom. If you missed that, then securing your position before BTC breaks $30k is your next bet. If bulls pull their weight, the next targets are $32,000 (target 1) and $38,000 (target 2).  For decades, the US dollar has served as the backbone of the global economy and has been a safe haven for international investors during times of crisis. In fact, several countries, such as El Salvador, Panama, and Ecuador, even use the US dollar as an official currency. However, since 2014, there has been a significant shift in the international arena. Russia and China have begun to challenge the longstanding dominance of the US dollar and have expressed a desire to reduce their reliance on it for international trade and investment. This trend is commonly referred to as “De-Dollarization.” USD losing its status as a global reserve currency and the banks failing are some of the greatest catalysts for BTC pumping.

2023-03-24 11:45:48+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Struggles To Break $29K As Credit Suisse Bank Edges To The Brink Of Collapse,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-struggles-to-break-29k-as-credit-suisse-bank-edges-to-the-brink-of-collapse/,"Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, is facing yet another hurdle in its quest for recovery as it struggles to break the $29,000 mark. This comes as investors cash in on the highly anticipated Arbitrum airdrop, which has sparked a frenzy in the cryptocurrency market. In addition to that, Credit Suisse, the 8th largest bank in the world has been facing problems with repaying its debts – prompting rumors of its collapse to spread across the investing community. Let’s dive in. Last week, Bitcoin went back over the 200 and 50-day moving averages, securing a safe landing. To confirm a breakout, Bitcoin needed to close the daily candle above the blue range.  If it broke out, the next resistance would be at $28,302 and then $32000. At that time, the bears had been decimated. However, as seen in previous analyses, the market was heavily manipulated. The beginning of this week saw continued tension in the markets, as investors looked forward to the FOMC meeting on March 22. On D-Day, Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve increased the interest rates by 25bps. This was expected by the markets, and hence, Bitcoin was not impacted by the news. The fall of the first three banks in the United States prompted people to rush into Bitcoin, pushing Bitcoin well above the consolidation zone. As predicted last week, Bitcoin reached $28,000 and found resistance there. From here, Bitcoin can retrace back to the upper trend line of the rising wedge (~$27,000) or back to the top of the range (~$25,200). If we break above $28k, Bitcoin will rise to $33,000, which so happens to be the next resistance. After the fall of Silvergate, Silicon Valley, and Signature banks, Credit Suisse is now in the limelight. The bank’s Credit Default Swaps rose to an all-time high after one of the largest backers from Saudi Arabia said it would no longer be guaranteeing Credit Suisse’s debts. After this blow, Credit Suisse’s stock crashed to even lower lows.  UBS, a global firm providing financial services in over 50 countries, agreed to buy Credit Suisse for $3.2 billion. If the deal goes through, Credit Suisse shareholders will be wiped out, selling their shares for just 0.76 CHF per share. The next significant date on the calendar for all financial markets is March 28-31, 2023, which are the possible dates for the XRP Case final ruling.

2023-03-22 08:00:00+00:00,Bitcoin As Safe Haven Due To Financial Turmoil Caused by Bank Collapses,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-as-safe-haven-due-to-financial-turmoil-caused-by-bank-collapses/,"Bitcoin has emerged as a safe haven for investors amidst recent financial turmoil caused by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Find out more in this article. The financial world has been experiencing some turbulence lately, with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which has had a ripple effect on the crypto markets. As the traditional banking industry faces challenges, Bitcoin has emerged as a safe haven for investors, defying the odds and soaring in value, hitting its highest point of the year. Many experts see Bitcoin’s rise in value as a hedge against inflation and global economic uncertainty. In times of crisis, investors tend to seek out safe assets to protect their investments, and Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and limited supply make it an attractive option. As a result, Bitcoin has become increasingly attractive to investors seeking alternative investment opportunities, especially given the challenges faced by the traditional banking industry. The bankruptcy of Silicon Valley Bank has caused mass panic and led to a sharp decline in major bank stocks. It has also led to the de-pegging of the top stablecoin, $USDC. This event has had a significant impact not only on the crypto markets but also on the traditional banking industry.  In contrast, Bitcoin has continued to rise in value, making it a surprising safe haven for many investors. According to data derived from CoinGecko, Bitcoin reached $28,503 but has since reached $27,777 as of the time of this writing. It’s worth noting that Bitcoin’s value can be highly volatile, and it remains to be seen whether its recent surge is sustainable in the long term. However, its ability to weather the storm of recent financial turmoil has caught the attention of many investors, further reigniting debates on this topic. The recent financial turmoil has highlighted the need for alternative investment opportunities, especially those that are not tied to traditional banking systems. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offer investors a decentralized and secure way to store value and make transactions, making them increasingly attractive as a safe haven asset. As such, it will be interesting to see how the traditional banking industry and cryptocurrencies will continue to interact in the coming years. Bitcoin has emerged as a surprising safe haven for investors in the face of recent financial turmoil caused by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Its decentralized nature and limited supply make it an attractive hedge against inflation and global economic uncertainty. While Bitcoin’s value remains highly volatile, its ability to weather the storm has once again caught the eyes of many investors."
2023-03-17 10:50:00+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Soars Past $25k As Banks Collapse In Europe & The USA,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-soars-past-25k-as-banks-collapse-in-europe-the-usa/,"Bitcoin has once again reached new local heights as it soared past the $25,000 mark, fueled by a pot of events. The surge in price comes amidst a backdrop of increased institutional adoption, a weakened US dollar, and continued economic uncertainty due to the on going bankruns.  So far, Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank have fallen, even though the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve are trying everything to save the sinking boat. Let us dive into the Bitcoin analysis. Last week Bitcoin dropped below its 200 and 50-day moving averages, a very dangerous point on the Daily chart. The next support levels for Bitcoin were at $18400, $17800, and $15900, with the possibility of dropping to pre-2021 lows if it continues dropping further.  This week, a strange mix of events caused Bitcoin to retrace and break out of the range (Blue Rectangle). News of Silicon Valley Bank crashing sent shivers down investor’s spines, especially because USDC’s Circle had exposure in the Bank to the tune of $3.3 billion. The depeg of USDC to $0.81 sent Bitcoin crashing down. After the FDIC joined forces with the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve to bail out the bank, Circle was able to recover the money and USDC regained its peg.Subsequently, more banks began catching the bank run contagion, an event which cemented the ‘Bitcoin over Banks’ narrative. This caused Bitcoin to start rallying. Bitcoin is back over the 200 and 50-day moving averages. This is a safe place to be. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $25860, and this is nicely above the blue range.  Bitcoin needs to close the daily candle above this range to confirm a breakout. If Bitcoin breaks out, the next resistance will be at $28,302 and then $32000. So far, the bears have been decimated. But as we have seen in previous analyses, the market is heavily manipulated. In a time when heavy-impact fundamental news drop on the daily, technical analysis can go so far. While it is good to do technical analysis, always leave room for disruption of the analysis by fundamental news. For the coming week, Bitcoin is definitely a buy. The more bank fail, the higher bitcoin goes. However, unverified sources suggest March 22/23 and March 31, 2023 may present pain to the markets. A quick look at those dates reveals possible reasons why. Keep an eye out and stay safe."

2023-03-10 18:22:32+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Breaks Below 20k as Macro-Economic Factors Collude to Crash the Markets,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-breaks-below-20k-as-macro-economic-factors-collude-to-crash-the-markets/,"The world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, broke below the key psychological level of $20,000 today, sparking fears among investors of a potential market crash. Bitcoin was already at a make-or-break moment, dangerously playing around the 200-day moving average. Is this the start of the last leg of the bear market? Let’s find out. Bad news hit the market last week and sent Bitcoin crashing to $22k. It was a fairly small crash but resulted in double-digit percentage losses in some altcoins. Despite the fall, Bitcoin remained above the 50, and 200-day moving averages. This was a good sign, showing that the bulls still controlled the market.  However, the intense feeling that the Bitcoin price was being manipulated has only increased in the past few weeks. The erratic movement of Bitcoin has become weird and no longer predictable. The series of negative market-impacting news has begun to render Technical Analysis mute. Nevertheless, as long as there are charts to analyze, we will analyze them. On Thursday, March 9, 2023, Bitcoin took another fat dump to the 20k region. This crash almost invalidated the Golden cross that had been formed earlier. Several macro-economic factors may have caused the crash. Bitcoin broke below the 200 and 50-day moving averages and currently sits at a dangerous place on the chart. The is next support levels for the asset are $18400, $17800, and finally, $15900. Below this, Bitcoin will be seeing pre-2021 lows. Bitcoin price action has been playing within this range (blue) since June 2022, and any break above or below the range would confirm either a bull or bear market, respectively. The case for a Bitcoin bullish move is largely insignificant since the markets are no longer as predictable as before. The bearish narrative, however, is strong. The coming week will be more bearish for Bitcoin since we expect an 8% drop from the current price. This crash comes in the wake of Biden increasing capital gains tax from 20% to 40%! This means that you will have to part with almost half of every withdrawal you make from crypto. In addition, Biden also put a 30% tax on Bitcoin and crypto mining operations. Perhaps the largest bearish catalyst was the liquidation of Silvergate Bank, one of the largest crypto-friendly banks in the world. Also, among other bearish news, the New York AG sued KuCoin and declared that Ethereum (ETH) is security – truly terrifying.

2023-03-10 10:00:00+00:00,Pennsylvania Leads the Way In Nuclear-Powered Bitcoin Mining,https://blockzeit.com/pennsylvania-leads-the-way-in-nuclear-powered-bitcoin-mining/,"With miners bracing themselves for a predicted increase in mining difficulty, the innovative approach offered by Nautilus promises to revolutionize the energy-intensive process. Bitcoin mining has been a controversial topic due to its energy-consuming process and the negative impact on energy resources and the environment. However, several Bitcoin mining firms have turned to renewable sources of energy, like hydropower and solar. TeraWulf, the owner and operator of domestic Bitcoin mining facilities powered by 91% zero-carbon energy, has now launched a 100% nuclear-powered Bitcoin mining facility in the US. It’s no coincidence that TeraWulf is making this move now when Bitcoin miners are getting ready for a fresh difficulty adjustment and the processing power needed to mine new coins is at an all-time high.  According to projections from the cryptocurrency mining data company CoinWarz, the next difficulty adjustment will take place on March 10, increasing the current difficulty level from 43.05 T to 44.46 T. The amount of computational power committed to mining Bitcoin globally (the “hash rate”) typically leads to an increase in the difficulty level of Bitcoin mining. To keep the average time between blocks mined on the blockchain at 10 minutes regardless of the hash rate, the difficulty increases proportionally.  Bitcoin’s hash rate has been steadily increasing since June of 2021. It set a new record of over 300 EH/s in late January of this year and then surpassed it by close to 100 EH/s in late February. According to CoinWarz, on March 2nd, the hash rate once again approached its all-time high, reaching 385 EH/s. The Bitcoin network becomes more secure and resistant to attacks as its hash rate rises, which is seen as an indication of its widespread usage. Because of this, Bitcoin is often regarded as the safest cryptocurrency available.  In spite of this, miners’ margins will be squeezed even further as a result of the increased difficulties, which might be challenging for many of the major mining corporations following a bad market that has lasted for almost a year. The largest publicly traded Bitcoin miner, Riot Blockchain, published earnings earlier this month showing a loss of more than $500 million from its mining operations in 2022. Even though the company generated significantly more BTC in 2022, the loss was significantly higher than the $15.4m loss it declared in 2021.  How Riot and other major mining operations will respond to this year’s steadily increasing Bitcoin mining difficulty and escalating energy costs is yet to be seen."
2023-03-06 06:40:55+00:00,Buying Bitcoin and Storing it in Digital Wallet – Complete Analysis,https://blockzeit.com/buying-bitcoin-and-storing-it-in-digital-wallet-complete-analysis/,"In recent years, the world of cryptocurrencies has grown in popularity hugely, with Bitcoin being the most well-known among thousands of such virtual currencies. Since Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, it is not controlled by a central bank and has no official backing hours; its structure and function are completely different from the traditional banking system. It is transparent, secure, and decentralized. We will examine the procedure for purchasing bitcoins and keeping them in a digital wallet in this project. Learn more about bitqt App by clicking here: bitqt-app.com Step 1: Understanding the Concept of Bitcoin: Before purchasing and storing bitcoins, it’s critical to understand the concept behind this digital currency. 2009 saw the creation of Bitcoin by an individual or group of individuals going under the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Because it is a decentralized digital currency, it operates independently of central banks and is not supported by any government. Bitcoins are created through a process called mining, in which individuals use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems. When a solution is found, a new block is added to the blockchain, and a certain number of bitcoins are released into circulation as a reward for the miner. The total number of bitcoins that can ever be created is capped at 21 million, which is expected to be reached around 2140. Step 2: Setting up a Digital Wallet: For buying bitcoins it is important that the trader should first set up a digital wallet. A digital wallet is a software program that allows you to store, receive, and send bitcoins by storing private and public keys securely. There are several types of digital wallets available, including web wallets, mobile wallets, software wallets, and hardware wallets. These are programs that can be downloaded to a computer. They provide the highest level of security, as they are stored on the device and are not accessible through the internet. However, these wallets are vulnerable to viruses and hacking attempts, so it is important to keep the software updated and follow basic computer security practices. Hardware wallets are physical devices that can be used to store bitcoins. Since they are not connected to the internet and are, therefore, less vulnerable to hacking attempts, they are more secure than software wallets. They can, however, be lost or damaged, and they are also more expensive. These wallets are online services that allow you to store bitcoins in the cloud. They are convenient to use. You can access these wallets from anywhere with an internet connection, but they are also less secure than software or hardware wallets. Web wallets are subject to security breaches and hacking attempts, so it is important to choose a reputable provider and follow basic security practices, such as using strong passwords and two-factor authentication. Once you have chosen a digital wallet, the next step is to create an account and set up a password. Some wallets will also require you to provide additional personal information, such as your name and address. Step 3: Buying Bitcoins: As you have now set up a digital wallet, you are ready to start buying bitcoins. There are several ways to buy bitcoins, including- Cryptocurrency trading exchanges are online platforms that offer so many cryptocurrencies and allow you to buy and sell bitcoins. You will need to set up an account on the exchange and verify your identity, which typically involves providing your name, address, and government-issued ID. You can also buy bitcoins directly from another person. This is known as direct trade or peer-to-peer exchanges and can be arranged through a platform such as LocalBitcoins. Some cities now have bitcoin ATMs, which allow you to buy bitcoins using a QR code provided by the ATM and a scanner that you will see in your wallet. Step 4: Storing Your Bitcoins Safely: Storing your bitcoins in a digital wallet is a secure way to keep them safe. So, whatever wallet you chose, the store uses it for the safe storage of your crypto holdings. Final Overview People all around the world are now investing in Bitcoins. To gain more accurate information on how to trade it and how you can make a diversified portfolio including other cryptos with bitcoin, check for the platform Ethereum trader which also offers you a trading facility."
2023-03-03 12:15:00+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Crashes to $22k As Major Cryptofirms Abandon Silvergate Bank,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-crashes-to-22000-as-major-cryptofirms-abandon-silvergate-bank/,"Brace yourselves, folks, as Bitcoin has just gone on a wild ride that nobody saw coming! The cryptocurrency just took a massive nosedive, crashing to $22,000 and wiping out a whopping $58 billion from the entire crypto market! Where is Bitcoin headed next week? Let’s find out. BTC/USD Chart by Tradingview Last week, Bitcoin experienced a bullish signal in the financial trading world as the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average. It dropped to $22k before finding support and bouncing back to $25k. However, $25k proved a strong resistance for the bulls, who were preparing for another attempt at breaking it. BTC/USD Chart by Tradingview Bitcoin is looking forward to a week of uncertainty. BTC is currently trading above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. This is bullish for the asset generally. Even though some devastating news hit the market yesterday, positive news streamed in today. The real question is which of these fundamentals has a stronger impact on the price of Bitcoin. We expect BTC to bounce off this fairly strong support to $25k. If the bull power is strong enough, the resistance at $25k should be broken, and BTC should rise to $28k, where the next resistance is expected to form. Silvergate Bank is a US commercial bank that provides financial services to businesses in the fintech and crypto industries. It’s considered a gateway to the crypto market.  However, it recently experienced a bank run when major clients announced they would suspend business with the bank due to a review of its books by regulators and the US Department of Justice.  This caused Silvergate’s shares to plummet more than 50%, leaving the bank’s future uncertain and the crypto market in turmoil. A new “groundbreaking” crypto index 401(k) has been launched, providing access to a $7 trillion market for Bitcoin and Ethereum investors. This innovative retirement plan is expected to appeal to young investors keen to include digital currencies in their portfolios.  ForUsAll, a San Francisco-based 401(k) provider, launched this new feature, allowing employees to invest a portion of their 401(k) directly into the cryptocurrencies of the Coindesk Market Select Index (CMIS). The CMIS index, created by Digital Currency Group-owned crypto news site, Coindesk, currently includes 28 cryptocurrency coins.  Which of these catalysts will affect Bitcoin more?

2023-02-24 11:20:26+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Flashes a Golden Cross, Sparking Hopes of a Super Bull Run",https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-flashes-a-golden-cross-sparking-hopes-of-a-super-bull-run/,"Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has recently flashed a golden cross on its price chart, a technical indicator that has sparked hopes among investors and traders of a super bull run.  The ‘golden cross’ is a common technical analysis term for bullish chart patterns. It occurs when a short-term moving average, typically the 50-day moving average, crosses above a long-term moving average, typically the 200-day moving average, on a price chart. Last week, Bitcoin attempted to break the $25,000 resistance level but faced selling pressure, causing its value to drop. However, positive momentum came back as buyers returned to the $25,000 level.  BTC’s price needed to surpass the $25,000 barrier to continue its upward trend toward the $30,000 range, which is a psychological price point. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $23,758.00. The double top pattern indicated a possible further bearish move towards the $22,000 support. BTC/USD Chart by Tradingview The 50-day moving average just crossed above the 200-day moving average, a popular bullish signal in the crypto and financial trading world. Bitcoin dropped back to the $22k area (zone of the cross) and found pretty healthy support, from which it bounced back up strongly and made for the $25k mark. $25k proved a stronger resistance than the bulls previously, though. Now letting out some steam, the bulls (or, shall I say, ‘the manipulators’) are gearing up for another try at the 25k resistance. Remember that this is a long forecast on BTC, but it is short-term. A sharp spike upwards to $33k, then a flash crash to less than $0.1 and back up to $10k is expected soon (purely off the charts). Fundamentals aside, the strong support provided by the 50-day EMA will give Bitcoin bulls the extra juice they need to break up over $25k."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."

The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2023-02-24 06:00:00+00:00,"Bitcoin’s Ordinals Surpass 150k, Increasing Transactions & Network Congestion",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoins-ordinals-surpass-150k-increasing-transactions-network-congestion/,"The number of newly created Bitcoin’s popular NFTs, Ordinals, has been spiking in recent weeks causing a surge in transaction fees and average block size on the Bitcoin blockchain. Since the launch of Ordinals in Jan. 2023, over 150,000 Ordinals have been inscribed, according to data from Dune. Independent developer Udi Wertheimer said the NFTs would improve the network’s security and encourage developers to build on it. By driving up transaction fees, Ordinals will incentivize miners to secure the network while the profit from mining will decrease with each Bitcoin halving. “Because the block space is scarce and because there’s demand for stuff like inscriptions, there’s a lot of hope that we will get enough people who want to pay fees to keep the Bitcoin network secure,” said Westheimer in an interview with Cointelegraph. The ordinals protocol enables users to transfer and receive satoshis, the smallest unit of bitcoin, in the form of unique inscribed data such as images and videos. Ordinals by Type as of Feb. 21. Source: Dune Unlike Ethereum and Solana NFTs which use smart contracts, Ordinals are increased directly onto individual Satoshis. The process occurs entirely on the Bitcoin network and does not need a sidechain or additional token. Several projects have been trying to bring NFTs to Bitcoin, the first and biggest cryptocurrency. Though NFTs have been in the Bitcoin system since 2014, some enthusiasts still don’t see the point. Some Bitcoin core developers believe that creating NFTs is not an appropriate use case for Bitcoin. However, Werthheimer dismissed the notion stating that for years, Bitcoin core developers “have ignored what actual Bitcoin users want.” He added that Ordinals provide a new use case to make building on Bitcoin commercially profitable. Casey Rodarmor, the creator of Ordinals, says the controversies surrounding Bitcoin NFTs help his cause. “I actually love the haters. I mean, they do more to drive people to find out about the project than anybody else. I don’t know why they think when they have these massive audiences and they go, ‘This is an attack on Bitcoin’ – it seems like you don’t want to do that if you don’t want people to use the thing.” Ordinals is still in its early stages and lack many key features that will sustain long-term growth. These include how to inscribe ordinals without having to link the entire Bitcoin blockchain, marketplaces, and wallets that allow creators to see their Ordinals."
2023-02-20 15:00:00+00:00,How Ordinals Project Will Benefit Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/how-ordinals-project-will-benefit-bitcoin/,"The sudden surge of Ordinal projects has brought about a renewed interest in the oldest most successful blockchain in the world, the Bitcoin network. Although not an entirely new discovery, the rising popularity of these kinds of projects is seen to benefit Bitcoin or even the entire crypto landscape in a lot of ways. Ordinal projects refer to projects that are built within the Bitcoin blockchain, using its underlying technology to create new and innovative applications. Initially, it enables one to inscribe images or NFTs as well as other forms of digital data directly in each satoshi or a hundred millionth of a Bitcoin. The proponent of the system is Udi Wertheimer, a self-employed developer and consultant in blockchain projects. The first of these digital artifacts was only launched in January this year, but they have experienced a boom since then. These were recorded spiking over 100,000 during the Valentine’s Day celebration, which brought about system congestion within the Bitcoin network. Despite this rather unfortunate event, crypto enthusiasts are more than hopeful about the promises of these new projects. Ordinal projects are foreseen to benefit the Bitcoin ecosystem in many ways, including the following: The spike in the creation of Ordinals in the past couple of weeks has contributed to the increase in the transaction fees and typical block size on the Bitcoin blockchain. The demand is particularly boosted by the scarcity of block space in the system for inscriptions. These will hopefully be enough to incentivize miners as revenues coming from mining rewards are expected to go down at each halving of Bitcoin. Higher transaction fees are projected by Wertheimer to bring about better incentivization for miners to further secure the Bitcoin network. He strongly believes that the rising demand for Ordinals will attract more people willing to pay fees to keep the blockchain safeguarded. In addition, the Ordinal projects developer believes that new use cases may be discovered later on that can potentially make Bitcoin more commercially profitable in the future. Ordinal projects can add new features and capabilities to the Bitcoin blockchain that were not realized in its original design. As shown recently, the scope of Ordinal projects encompasses more than just the realm of NFTs. Aside from JPEG images, they can be used to inscribe other forms of digital art, profile picture (PFP) projects, and even the original 1993 version of the Doom video game. By making it easier and more efficient to use Bitcoin, ordinal projects can help further promote the adoption and usage of this cryptocurrency. This can lead to more users, more transactions, and more overall value in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Overall, ordinal projects can help expand the utility of the Bitcoin blockchain in ways never fully explored before. Likewise, the introduction of these at the forefront of the crypto industry can support the Bitcoin ecosystem in widening its reach in various niches, making it a more useful and valuable technology for different users and businesses going onward."

The cryptocurrency rose to $25,234 but encountered significant selling pressure. However, positive momentum is returning as buyers show interest in today’s $25,000 resistance level. BTC/USD Chart Analysis: Source Tradingview.com In the previous analysis, Bitcoin was in two scenario outcomes. However, the possibility of a bounce back from $21900 support was inevitable. If the 200-day moving average (MA) acts as strong support and bullish investors dominate, Bitcoin could surge to $24,000.  The buying pressure looked substantial enough even to surpass the local resistance level established at this point. This showed the possibility of buyers propelling the price toward the $31,000 to $32,000 range. Once Bitcoin breaches the $24,000 mark, there is minimal resistance to impede its climb until it reaches the range above. BTC/USD Chart Analysis. Source Tradingview.com The bulls have been unable to sustain it beyond the $25,000 resistance level. The cryptocurrency hit a high of $25,235, but faced selling pressure, causing its value to drop. However, positive momentum is regained as buyers return to the $25,000 resistance level. If BTC’s price surpasses the $25,000 barrier level, its upward trend will likely continue in the $31,000 and $32,000 range.  The next target is to break the next resistance level of $25,235, with the ultimate goal of reaching the psychological price barrier of $30,000. As of writing, the current value of Bitcoin stands at $23,758.00. The double top pattern might result in a further bearish move to the $22000 support. The war on stablecoins by the SEC can deliver a fatal wound to crypto. Binance CEO, CZ, is now considering adopting algorithmic stablecoins to avoid interference by U.S regulators. This week, Binance whitelisted Terra USD Classic (USTC) for trading on Binance, which raised the defamed asset. Will the war on stablecoins drive BTC lower? Only time will tell.

2023-02-16 11:00:00+00:00,"100,000+ Ordinals Flooded The Bitcoin Network on Valentine’s Day",https://blockzeit.com/100000-ordinals-flooded-the-bitcoin-network-on-valentines-day/,"Just when we thought that we are now only waiting for the last Bitcoin to be minted, a controversial new protocol was recently integrated into its platform and it’s garnering a lot of attention lately. Last Valentine’s Day, the network of the oldest and most successful crypto was flocked by Ordinal inscriptions, which garnered cheers from crypto fans but also consequently brought about congestion within. I TOLD YOU 100K TODAY🔥🔥🔥 On February 14, 2023, Ordinal inscriptions crossed the 100,000 mark as it pulled in digital creators. The flooding caused the standard 300 MB memory limit per block in the Bitcoin network to go over by 86 MB. The resulting scenario was that it forced the network to purge other transactions going below the 1.74 sats/vB (Satoshi per byte). The concept of NFTs in the Bitcoin blockchain is not entirely new since Colored Coins and Rare Pepes preceded the present Ordinals protocol. However, it’s only now that it would attract plenty of attention probably because a lot of people now have more familiarization and understanding of NFTs. Ordinals are a new phenomenon on the Bitcoin blockchain. Basically, this new protocol allows non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to be embedded in Bitcoin transactions. To be exact, it enables the inscription of images and other forms of data directly in satoshis, which are the smallest denomination units of BTC. Each satoshi is worth a hundred millionth of a Bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC). Without being too technical, an Ordinal can be entrenched in it without the need to create another token or a sidechain. Among the files successfully integrated into them by far are JPEG images, digital art, and profile picture (PFP) projects. Impressively, even the 1993 Doom video game has been fused into the same protocol. Ordinal projects just came about in January this year. Now, it is seemingly experiencing a quick, widespread following as shown by the volume of inscriptions that transpired on the Bitcoin blockchain involving them. The unorthodox process employed in Ordinals opens up new boundaries and opportunities to be explored in both the oldest successful cryptocurrency in the world and the realm of NFTs. Normally, the metadata of NFTs like those found on Ethereum, Solana, and Stacks can be changed or removed by their smart contract creator. However, Ordinals work differently because they are not dependent on smart contracts. As mentioned earlier, they are affixed straight up in satoshis. Ordinals are deemed immutable and permanently preserved within the Bitcoin blockchain. For this reason, every Ordinal is considered to be a “digital artifact” as it’s there to stay. Despite its newly-unlocked benefits, there is still a lot to be explored in the Ordinance protocol. Currently, this kind of NFT requires syncing with the entire Bitcoin blockchain before its inscription. Support for the exchanges for digital artifacts and wallets that allow users access to their Ordinals is presently scarce, too. Lastly, it can cause the whole Bitcoin network to be overwhelmed in certain cases as exhibited in the latest Valentine’s Day incident. All these are barriers that Ordinals developers are looking to address sometime soon. Looking to trade Ordinals Inscriptions (aka Bitcoin NFTs)?You’ll have to string together a web of tedious tasks to make it happen. Here’s everything you need to know. 🧵 Speaking of “NFTs”, the team led by Casey Rodamor who came up with the Ordinals protocol wants to distance the two as much as possible. Although they are technically NFTs, the group prefers them to be called as “digital artifacts” or “Ordinal NFTs”. This is to avoid associating Ordinals with the controversial nature of NFTs in general as the term is thought to be “tainted” by Rodamor. The true immutability and permanence of Ordinals within the Bitcoin blockchain sure do present a lot of potential in the realm of NFTs. However, it could also be a Pandora’s Box waiting to be unleashed if used in the wrong hands. For now, there is a lot to be explored in the protocol, and we are hoping that it will result in nothing but the best for everyone involved."
2023-02-10 12:00:00+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $22,000 as SEC Goes After Crypto Staking",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-below-the-22000-as-sec-goes-after-crypto-staking/,"SEC’s crackdown on crypto staking sends shockwaves through the industry as Bitcoin drops below the $22,000 mark, igniting debates on the future of digital currencies. Bitcoin dropped by over $1000, as over $70 billion disappeared from the market in less than 24 hours. Can Bitcoin recover the lost gains? Here’s this week’s Bitcoin analysis. The previous analysis discussed Bitcoin trading around $24,250 with resistance at that level. A major market-moving event could push the price above the resistance. Otherwise, a retest of the top of the falling wedge could be expected. The 200-day moving average was expected to support and prevent a significant price drop. The analysis also pointed out two key levels, $25,220 and $31,785, that may provide resistance if the price continues to rise. Bitcoin is currently retracing after hitting the resistance level at $24,256. The chart presents two scenarios of the outcome of the BTC for next week. Bitcoin is currently sitting at the 200-day moving average – a very key indicator in technical analysis. If it breaks below this indicator, the markets should be prepared for maximum pain. Below it is the 50-day moving average (green). This indicator might act as a secondary support for Bitcoin if it does slide below the 200-day MA. If 50-day MA does not hold, the bears will push the price to $18,800. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also on a downward trend trading slightly below the 50-level mark. This signals a solid bearish week ahead for Bitcoin investors and traders.  If the 200-day MA does hold its ground and bulls move their weight around, BTC might have a run back up to $24,000. Depending on the bull’s power, the rally might break the local resistance that formed at this level, pushing the price to $31k – $32 range. After $24,000 there is little upward resistance until the aforementioned range. The SEC and other US government agencies are hawks, eyeing down Bitcoin and waiting for the right time to attack. However, as they wait for the right time to deliver the death blow, they continues to wage small wars against Bitcoin and Crypto. The most recent in this barrage of assaults in the Kraken settlement lawsuit with SEC, the result of which is Kraken shutting down its US crypto-staking service. In addition to that, Kraken paid a $30M fine in the settlement case. In the wake of this verdict, Bitcoin and crypto crash.  The war wages on.  DISCLAIMER: The work included in this article is based on current events, technical charts, company news releases, and the author’s opinions.

But with Bitcoin surging beyond $20,000, things seem promising for the first quarter of 2023. Even though we are only in the second month of the year, we have already witnessed a significant increase in the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Is it possible that we are witnessing a market turnaround, which would likely signal the beginning of a bull run?  Several economic indicators, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), and Personal Consumer Expenditures (CPE), have recently produced better-than-expected outcomes. Despite this, the technology sector continues to see significant layoffs. Market watchers are also intently observing the Federal Reserve’s decision as they have raised interest rates by 25 basis points at the FOMC meeting held on February 2nd.  The fear and greed index has not been at this level since April of 2022; it is currently at its greatest point. The indicator demonstrates without a doubt that 2023 will be the year that cryptocurrencies make a comeback, although not to new all-time highs.

Bears were completely taken aback when Bitcoin (BTC) broke through the $20,000 resistance level in the middle of January. Who would have imagined that the double bottom pattern propels Bitcoin’s price as high as $24,000. As a result, it filled in the gaps for November 2022, which was when the FTX collapsed and sent a massive panic from people globally. As we move closer to levels of resistance, market traders are advised to lock in their profits. If you are an investor, the best strategy is to buy when the price is around a support level, such as the 200-day exponential moving average; alternatively, you can dollar cost average (DCA). Let us assume that the bottom is in for Bitcoin, by using the fibonacci retracement from the November 8 highs to the November 21 lows, there are two levels to watch closely: the 50% ($42,000) and the 61.8% ($48,500) golden pocket. Could it be a launchpad to these price levels or a massive resistance? Only time will tell and it is best to remain cautiously optimistic. As we observe a resurgence in the crypto market, we must approach positive data with cautious optimism. While there are certainly positive signs and growth potential, it is crucial to keep in mind the volatility and unpredictability of the market and make informed investment decisions. While it can be exciting to see the market turn around, yet it is important to remember that past performance is not a guarantee of future success. Do your own thorough research, understand the risks involved, and diversify investments to minimize potential losses. Only invest what you can afford to lose and always have a well thought-out plan in place."

This further fuelled investors’ notions that we have left the bear market behind. Are they in for a rude awakening? Let’s find out. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on Feb 1 released a statement announcing the hike of its benchmark federal funds rate by 25 basis points. The range is now at 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest level in 15 years. “The Committee anticipates that the ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.” In last week’s analysis, Bitcoin broke out but struggled to break above the 23k mark. The FOMC news this week was the deciding factor. Powell’s speech was the spark that send Bitcoin flying and breaking the previously established resistance. The volume also increased facilitating the pump but is this pump sustainable? Many traders seem to think not. Bitcoin is sitting at another resistance around $24,500. It could take another major news to push Bitcoin above this resistance, otherwise, a crash back to the top of the falling wedge (retest) should be expected.  BTC is trading above the 50-day (2) and 200-day (1) moving averages, which is a pretty big deal in the world of technical analysis. 200-day moving average should now play the role of support for the price, preventing BTC from crashing lower. If Bitcoin decides to move higher, $25,220, and $31,785 are some of the key resistance points to check out. We are entering into unknown territory in 2023. The majority of the plans for the Great Reset by the World Economic Forum begin to take shape this year, propelling us full speed into a dystopian future. This can already be seen in how major long-standing conglomerates are falling left right and center.  The move to destroy the Dollar as the global reserve currency and adopt CBDCs has never been more aggressive. Bitcoin’s erratic price movements further render the majority of age-old technical analysis techniques useless. This manufactured pump is shaping up to be the largest Bull Trap in all of crypto history. Stay safe.

Is there a truth to their assumptions?  Let’s find out! The bitcoin rally last week saw many people turn bullish on the asset. Indeed, many altcoins did pump, with APTOS gaining the largest percentage among the large cap alts. While the DOJ crackdown on Bitzlato slowed down the rise of Bitcoin, a further push from the bulls jolted it past the $22k resistance. However, the asset has hit a snag. Several attempts at breaking above $23,100 mark have resulted in failure, leading some to think the much anticipated bull trap is finally mature. On the four-day chart, it appears that Bitcoin has retested a potential bear flag pattern. If this pattern plays out, it could indicate that the current price is the top. Some people believe that Bitcoin could reach 25,000 or 30,000, but this depends on the performance of traditional markets. If stocks see an increase, it could be a bullish sign for Bitcoin. The market does not appear strong enough for Bitcoin to reach 30,000. The idea that the current uptrend could be a major “bull trap” may have some truth to it. Some of the major price increases appear suspicious, particularly when there is a spike in activity during weekends when trading volume is low. This is supported by the bearish divergences seen in the relationship between price and volume, which suggest that it is artificially being manipulated.

The asset had been ripping through the chart and touched a high of $21k before encountering the resistance. Can Bitcoin break through this resistance or is it the end of the road for now? Last week’s analysis saw Bitcoin at $18,867. The asset had just broken out of the humongous descending triangle and no one was sure whether it was real or a fakeout. Subsequently, we confirmed that the pump could not be trusted since it was highly manipulated.  From all angles, there is no reason why BTC should be going up. We pointed out a few reasons including: Our stance on Bitcoin has not changed. While everyone is longing Bitcoin, we are watching from the sidelines, expecting a massive crypto crash soon. Bitcoin is facing overhead resistance at the $21k level. It has tried to break through three times before in the last five months. The asset broke out of the large descending triangle in a series of aggressive moves that sent a signal to many investors and traders that the bear season was over. If Bitcoin breaks through this resistance, it will rise to $25,000 pretty quickly.  Apart from the local resistance at $20-$21k, BTC encountered some unexpected sell pressure yesterday after the Department of Justice scheduled a press briefing about crypto. Everyone in the space was anxious about what the government agency had to say about the industry. In the press briefing, the DOJ and FBI revealed that they had shut down and opened investigations on Bitzlato, a cryptocurrency exchange. Anatoly Legkodymov, the 40- year Russian founder of the exchange is facing criminal charges including unlicensed money transfers. The depute Attorney General of the U.S. said they will work with other global law enforcement agencies to make sure criminals do not use crypto to fund their activity. The DOJ mainly took down Bitzlato because it was being used by Russia to circumvent the economic sanctions imposed on it by the United States. It was also reported that the final destination of some of the funds on Bitzlato was Binance. The tension on crypto continues to mount as the series of events taking place point to a potential market collapse sometime in the future.

2023-01-19 11:10:48+00:00,Binance Custody Launches Off-Exchange For Institutional Investors,https://blockzeit.com/binance-custody-launches-off-exchange-for-institutional-investors/,"Binance, the top cryptocurrency exchange globally, revealed the introduction of Binance Mirror, an off-exchange settlement option for institutional investors. Binance Mirror will allow institutional investors to invest and trade utilizing cold custody. Most cryptocurrency traders maintain their assets on the exchange, which puts them at risk when there is market volatility that causes significant platform outflows. With cold storage wallets, this risk is eliminated. The cryptocurrency market has been in a state of turmoil following the collapse of FTX, with centralized exchanges such as Binance experiencing a significant reduction in customer deposits due to the mounting uncertainty. In response to this, there has been a growing push for self-custody, as investors become increasingly concerned about the potential for more centralized exchanges (CEXs) to fold. However, Binance is now offering a new product that aims to protect institutional investors from these risks. Binance Mirror is a cold storage solution that allows institutions to lock specified asset balances, which are then mirrored on their exchange accounts at a 1:1 balance. This means that, rather than posting collateral directly onto the Binance exchange, institutions can now use Binance Mirror to ensure that their assets are safe and secure. The use of cold storage solutions like Binance Mirror is becoming increasingly popular in the crypto space, as they offer a higher level of security than traditional hot wallets. Cold storage refers to the practice of keeping digital assets offline, on a device that is not connected to the internet, to protect them from hacking and other forms of online theft. This new product from Binance provides a much-needed solution for institutional investors who are looking for a safe and secure way to store their assets in the crypto space. With the growing uncertainty surrounding centralized exchanges, Binance Mirror offers a way for institutions to protect their assets while still having access to them on the Binance exchange. Binance Team stated that: “As long as their Mirror position is open on the Binance Exchange, assets will remain secure in their segregated cold wallet, and can be settled at any time.” VP of Binance Custody, Athena Yu also said:  “Institutional customers want the substantial liquidity that the Binance Exchange provides but security is their top priority. The finest of both worlds is brought together by Binance Mirror” As a result, the introduction of Mirror presents the cryptocurrency company with a chance to roll out new features that will advance the functionality of cold storage. Despite the difficult market circumstances brought on by a year-long bear market, more people visit Binance each month than any other exchange.  According to Coingecko data, Binance received 66.6 million monthly visits, compared to 35.4 and 15.6 million for Coinbase Global and ByBit, respectively. Furthermore, Binance has the greatest daily traded volume, which attracts institutional investors. In the months that have passed after the collapse of FTX and Alameda, the cryptocurrency exchange has substantially contributed to the stabilization of the sector. The creation of the appropriate trading tools, according to Changpeng Zhao (CZ), CEO of Binance, will aid in the mainstream market’s adoption of cryptocurrencies. There seems to be plenty of weird surprises in crypto. But build never fails. Keep building. The repercussions from FTX have considerably helped the cryptocurrency market, which is dominated by the price of Bitcoin. The market value of all cryptocurrencies has increased by $1 trillion, with the price of Bitcoin (BTC) constantly hovering above $21k, according to our most recent crypto price oracles. With a price increase of nearly 44% over the previous seven days, the Solana ecosystem has seen the greatest increases recently. Binance Mirror is a new product that offers a much-needed solution for institutional investors in the crypto space. The use of cold storage solutions is becoming increasingly popular, and Binance Mirror provides a safe and secure way for institutions to store their assets while still having access to them on the Binance exchange. With the growing uncertainty surrounding centralized exchanges, Binance Mirror is a valuable addition to the crypto market."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2023-01-13 12:19:17+00:00,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Broke $18.500, Should We Trust This Pump?",https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-broke-18-500-should-we-trust-this-pump/,"Bitcoin has recently seen a significant price increase, breaking out from a period of relative consolidation. While this sudden jump in value may be exciting for investors, it’s important to remember that the highly volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market means that caution should be exercised when making investment decisions. Can investors trust his pump or is it a bull trap? Let’s find out. Last week’s analysis brought us to a rather gloomy conclusion – Bitcoin was headed down. However, the asset has done a complete 180-degree turn and is headed up. There were two possible outcomes from last week’s analysis: Bitcoin chose to go with the latter.  The asset rallied massively out of the blue pushing past $18500 and setting new local highs. The asset had previously tried breaking the $18,350 resistance (thick straight line) before but failed. Additionally, the asset broke out of the three-month descending triangle (trendline) presenting a major bullish signal. No.  The whole instapump reeks of price manipulation from smart money. In a time when major crypto companies are filing for bankruptcy, it is highly suspicious that Bitcoin price decides to move up.  Let us not forget the liquidity hunt zones. If this rally is a run on liquidity, then the liquidations will be of epic proportions. Smart money needs to collect all the liquidity on the buy side before crashing the price. This could be the last rally before the megadump to $8,000.  Investors should be cautious of this move. Billionaires are calling a crypto crash at the end of January. While the information is not verified, they could have some insider information since they are also smart money. A wise man will heed the warning and prepares accordingly. It might seem insane, calling bear moves while the market is green but the best traders SELL GREEN and BUY GREEN. The situation on the Barry Silbert is still developing and it might be the catalyst that finally plunges the markets into chaos.Brace yourselves.

2023-01-11 12:19:54+00:00,"Bitcoin Whales Are Optimistic And Accumulate Additional 20,000 BTC",https://blockzeit.com/large-bitcoin-investors-optimistic-about-purchasing-20000-btc/,"The cryptocurrency market has been experiencing a period of struggling prices and low momentum in recent times. However, recent data from on-chain aggregator Santiment suggests that large investors, known as “bitcoin whales,” are once again beginning to accumulate BTC. This accumulation trend could signal a potential movement on the horizon for the digital asset. According to Santiment, large bitcoin whales holding between 1,000-10,000 BTC are accelerating their accumulation. Over the past five days, these investors have added more than 20,000 BTC to their balances, representing a significant accumulation trend. As a result, these bitcoin whales now hold a total of 4.57 million BTC, or 23.7% of the total circulating BTC supply. This accumulation may have contributed to the recent recovery trend seen in the price of bitcoin. This accumulation trend comes after a period of low activity among large bitcoin whales. According to Bitcoinist, large whale transactions fell to only 19% of total bitcoin transactions, indicating a lack of activity among these large investors. However, the recent accumulation data suggests a more long-term play on the part of these whales, and a willingness to buy at current levels. This could indicate that these large investors believe that the price of bitcoin may have reached its bottom. At present, bitcoin is trading comfortably above the $17,000 level, following a late weekend rally that pushed it above this important technical level. The digital asset is currently just above its 50-day moving average of $17,212, putting it in a precarious position. This means that the price of bitcoin could swing either way and that it wouldn’t take much to trigger a significant movement. While the accumulation of these large whales may have contributed to the recent uptrend, there needs to be more demand for BTC in order for it to continue moving upward and break above its 50-day moving average. If the price of bitcoin were to fall below this level, it would still have support at $16,600, which could result in a loss of around $500 off its value. On the other hand, if momentum were to pick up, BTC could test the $17,500 resistance level before the end of the week. It is worth noting that at this moment, bitcoin is trading at $17,213, with a 0.06% increase in the last day and a 2.95% increase in the last 7 days. The recent accumulation trend among large bitcoin whales could signal a potential movement on the horizon for the digital asset. While the market has been experiencing a period of struggling prices and low momentum, the accumulation of these large investors could indicate a more long-term play and a belief that the price of bitcoin may have reached its bottom. Nevertheless, there needs to be more demand for BTC in order for it to continue moving upward, and we will have to wait to see whether it can break above its 50-day moving average."
2023-01-06 12:21:04+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Moves Sideways Amid Market Uncertainty,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-moves-sideways-amid-market-uncertainty/,"Bitcoin continued its sideways movement today, hovering around the same price point despite market uncertainty. The king of crypto continues to maintain the 16k – 17k zone amid massive company layoffs and bankruptcy filings. Is Bitcoin a ticking timebomb? Let’s explore this further. Last week’s Bitcoin analysis showed some interesting insights into the Bitcoin chart. The price was dangerously close to the 10, 21, and 50-day moving averages. We expected BTC to fall off this week or sometime soon. However, since the markets are manipulated (yes, you should know that by now), BTC has held steady.  We also expected a retest on the 50-day moving average before another leg downward. Bitcoin managed to hold its price below $16,929 and above $16,427 for the past two weeks now, which is quite amazing given how tight that range is. The tight range mentioned above is inside an even larger range spanning over 2 months now. You can see the buy-side liquidity (BSL) and sell-side liquidity (SSL) hunts by institutional money. The moves try to take the smaller fish out of the market. They are usually employed when the smart money is about to drive prices in one direction aggressively.  The tight range mentioned above also sheds light on a previously unseen chart pattern – the bearish flag. Bearish flags are continuation patterns. The black swan event that has been referred to in many Bitcoin analysis articles here seems to have only been pushed forward. News of crypto billionaires declaring bankruptcy, others getting murdered, and billionaire crypto companies filling bankruptcy have the entire crypto sphere rattled. Do Kwon of Terra Luna, 3Arrows Capital, Celsius, FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried, and most recently Barry Silbert of DCG have been brought to their knees by the current economic times. According to Forbes, Barry Silber, founder of Digital Currency Group (DCG )and Grayscale Trust is now worth zero. The crypto-venture capitalist who was once worth $3 billion is now in so much debt, his entire net worth would be able to pay it off. Reports of Genesis Global Capital filing for bankruptcy if they fail to pay back the Winkelvoss twins a $900 million loan would force Grayscale to liquidate. This is terrifying news since Grayscale currently holds 643,572 BTC. The Bitcoin crash that would follow would be of epic proportions. The black swan was never averted.

2023-01-04 12:32:50+00:00,Bitcoin Developer Suffers Devastating Loss Of $3.3M In PGP Hack,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-developer-suffers-devastating-loss-of-3-3m-in-pgp-hack/,"On January 1, Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr made a shocking announcement on Twitter: his wallet had been hacked and he had lost over 200 BTC, worth approximately $3.3 million at current market prices. Dashjr stated that the hack was the result of a compromise of his Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) key, though he did not provide any further details on how the attackers gained access to it. This news has sparked speculation and concern among the cryptocurrency community, with many questioning the safety and security of their own assets. But what is PGP and how could it have been used to hack Dashjr’s DeFi wallet? PGP, or Pretty Good Privacy, is a cryptographic method used to encrypt and decrypt data. It was originally developed in 1991 by Philip Zimmermann as a way to secure communication and protect against surveillance. PGP works by using a combination of public key and private key encryption. The public key is used to encrypt the data, while the private key is used to decrypt it. This means that anyone with the public key can send a message to the owner of the private key, but only the owner of the private key can read the message. Keys generated via PGP can also be used to verify the authenticity and integrity of certain pieces of information. For example, a PGP key can be used to sign a software download, ensuring that it has not been tampered with and is legitimate. PGP is widely used in the cybersecurity industry and is considered to be a very secure method of encrypting data. So how could PGP have been used in the hack of Dashjr’s wallet? One possibility is that the attacker gained access to Dashjr’s PGP key through a server compromise. In November, Dashjr had noted that his server had been hacked, and it is possible that the attacker was able to extract the private key to his wallet through this point of entry. This theory is supported by the fact that Banteg, the pseudonymous developer of Yearn Finance, commented on the incident on Twitter, suggesting that it could be a potential “supply chain attack.” A supply chain attack occurs when a hacker modifies software by injecting malicious code into a system. In this case, the hacker may have gained access to Dashjr’s server through a compromised PGP key and later extracted the private key to his hot wallet, which was connected to the server. This theory has not yet been confirmed through a formal investigation, and it is possible that the attacker used a different method to gain access to Dashjr’s PGP key and wallet. Regardless of the specific method used in this attack, the incident highlights the importance of strong cybersecurity measures and the need for individuals and organizations to protect their assets and data. PGP is generally considered to be a secure method of encrypting data, but as with any technology, it is not foolproof and can be vulnerable to exploitation. It is important for users of PGP and other cryptographic methods to take steps to safeguard their keys and monitor their systems for signs of compromise. The hack of Dashjr’s wallet has garnered significant attention within the cryptocurrency community, with many expressing concern over the safety and security of their own assets. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has stated that his team is monitoring the assets and will freeze them if they are sent to the centralized exchange. It remains to be seen how the situation will develop, but it is clear that cybersecurity is a critical issue in the world of cryptocurrency."
2022-12-30 13:03:46+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Remains Overwhelmingly Bearish Going into the New Year,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-remains-overwhelmingly-bearish-going-into-the-new-year/,"Bitcoin price is not looking good as bearish indicators flash all over the Bitcoin price chart. The black swan event we mentioned a few weeks back seems to have been averted – for now. Nevertheless, the Bitcoin chart remains in a perpetual state of uncertainty.  Here is why. Last week’s Bitcoin analysis presented two scenarios both of which were bearish. Bitcoin was to have a short rally toward the local resistance of $16,962 before heading down (2). Alternatively, Bitcoin could have just skipped the rally part and dumped straightaway (1). Bitcoin was also trending below the 10, 21, and 5–day moving averages, something not good for the future of the asset. No big news has broken in the crypto sphere this week. Other than the -2.9% expected to dump from Bitcoin on Tuesday and Wednesday, the space has generally been quiet albeit rumours of several crypto mining companies going down have been popping up around crypto twitter (CT). Microstrategy also picked up another 2500 BTC for $46 million, bringing its total BTC holding to 132,251 BTC valued at ~$4.03 billion. Microstrategy’s average Bitcoin buying price is now ~$30,397 per BTC. Several interesting things are taking place on the Bitcoin chart. The price is trending closely below the 10 (red), 21(blue), and 50-EMA (black). This is a tipping point, and historically, a zone of rejection. Our predictions of a $10,000 BTC still stand. Although the timelines could be skewed. The chart also shows a possible double bottom forming, although it is too early to tell. If it turns out to be a double-bottom pattern, we expect BTC price to test the 50-EMA in a sharp burst in price action before coming back down. If that happens, it could signal the beginning of the long-anticipated crash. Have a happy new year and Stay safe. The markets are still bearish.

According to a statement released by MicroStrategy on Wednesday, the company purchased 2.4 thousand Bitcoins between November 1 and December 21 for a total of $42.8 million in cash, or an average price of $17.9 thousand per BTC. On December 22, at an average price of $16.8 thousand per Bitcoin, the company sold 704 Bitcoins for $11.8 million. The capital losses from this sale will be offset by prior capital gains, according to MicroStrategy.

By selling investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs at a loss, you will be able to balance the taxes due on capital gains made in other parts of your portfolio, controlling and minimizing your tax burden. As a result, investing becomes more tax-efficient. Even taxes payable on regular income can be mitigated by tax-loss harvesting. Since short-term capital gains are typically taxed at a greater rate than long-term capital gains, this method is most frequently employed to reduce the amount of taxes owed on those gains. Long-term financial gains could, however, also be offset using this strategy. In 2020, MicroStrategy adopted Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. The developer of analytics software, led by proponent of Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor, has benefited from any decline in price of the cryptocurrency by increasing the amount of Bitcoin it has invested in it. Thoughts of a protracted “crypto winter” have caused Bitcoin to move in lockstep with other cryptocurrencies as they plummet, proving this tactic to be a dangerous gamble. The question at hand is whether this slide sets off a margin call, which would compel Saylor’s business intelligence company to sell some of its holdings. The company would never sell its Bitcoin assets, according to MicroStrategy CEO, who anticipates the price of Bitcoin to reach $6 million. The executive also disclosed his personal ownership of 17,732 Bitcoins, saying that the popular cryptocurrency is “unstoppable” and will displace gold. On Twitter, Michael Saylor is currently receiving a significant amount of criticism. He is allegedly accused of deceiving individuals by telling them to sell their possessions, including their homes, in order to purchase Bitcoin. People are currently at a loss after the collapse of Bitcoin. ""take all your money & buy #bitcoin.. figure out how to borrow more money to buy more bitcoin.. go mortgage your house & buy bitcoin with it"" @michael_saylor March 2021 bitcoin $56k Be careful giving & taking financial advice, esp. w/alternative assetsbitcoin today ~$33k pic.twitter.com/gguNjoEMcr Investors are always urged to conduct their own research before investing money in cryptocurrencies because the crypto market is highly volatile. Bitcoin has also been hailed as a store of value, which means that it is more suitable for long-term investment than short-term. People have the tendency to speak in absolute statements. This can be observed throughout life, but it is most prevalent in public discourse. Absolute statements frequently result in a prepared response while neglecting the facts at hand. Avoid listening to folks who use absolutes when you are making decisions. Watch out for speakers who provide their opinions without having any actual knowledge of your circumstances."
2022-12-23 12:20:14+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Hangs Off a Cliff as Markets Speed into the Christmas Holiday,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-price-hangs-off-a-cliff-as-markets-speed-into-the-christmas-holiday/,"Bitcoin is not out of the woods yet as technical indicators show the asset might crash anytime. At this point, traders can only practice extreme caution while trading or exit the market all together. Our previous hunch of a black swan event on Dec. 20, 2022 proved to be false – or is it? Let us dive into this week’s Bitcoin price analysis. Last week’s analysis saw Bitcoin threaten to rise slightly as a result of the good CPI data. The breakout was unexpected and the asset rallied to around $18,357 after which it crashed hard towards the close of the week. Eventually, BTC closed the week at $16,781. Was it a scam pump? Of course it was. Bulls got caught completely with their pants down and got over $270M in Longs liquidated between Dec 14 and Dec. 16, 2022.  For the longest time in the crypto space, cryptoassets usually crash on weekends and then recover throughout the following week. Experts in the space have attributed this to less volumes, and margin calls due to banks being closed for the weekend. While this might be true, this unseemingly coincidental occurrence of events creates a favorable environment for Market Makers and Smart Money to move the market in their favor. The incoming weekend coincides with the Christmas holiday. If volumes are low during normal weekends, then you can expect they will be even lower during this one. Will it be the perfect time for Smart Money to crash the market? Let’s see in the charts. There are two scenarios that could play out moving on from here. In the first scenario, BTC price, which is currently below (and struggling to break) the 21-day moving average, can crash below the strong support (pink band) (1). The second scenario is a move higher above the 21-day MA in a fake-out fashion before hitting the local resistance at 16,962 and heading back down below the strong support (2). Both scenarios are bearish and are likely to happen during the weekend. What better way for Smart Money to ruin people’s christmas? The levels to look out for as we move down are $16,242, $15,631, $10,228 and $8,036.  If we break below $15,500, you want to begin buying the dip as this could be the last crash before we begin a new bull market.  DISCLAIMER: The work included in this article is based on current events, technical charts, company news releases, and the author’s opinions.

A judge in the Bahamas has denied the disgraced FTX founder’s plea for bail as the former billionaire is considered a flight risk. Bankman-Fried had told the Bahamian courts hours prior to the judgment that he would oppose any extradition order to the U.S.On Tuesday, Bankman-Fried was supposed to appear virtually before the US House Financial Services Committee, which is pressing for information concerning the company’s demise and its subsequent ripple effects throughout the digital asset ecosystem. A number of cryptocurrency firms have ceased operations, frozen customer accounts, and in some cases filed for bankruptcy as a direct result of their reliance on FTX. After his indictment, committee chair Representative Maxine Waters said that Bankman-Fried would not be testifying as planned on Tuesday. But the meeting was scheduled to begin with evidence from FTX’s new CEO, John J. Ray III, who took over for Bankman-Fried on November 11 and is responsible for guiding the company through bankruptcy.The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York unsealed an indictment against Bankman-Fried, which lists eight counts of criminal activity, including wire fraud and conspiracy through mishandling customer funds. If he is to be found guilty on all eight counts, he faces a possible 115-year sentence, which is the maximum allowed under federal law. During the previous election cycle, Bankman-Fried was the Democratic Party’s second biggest donor. Since the foundation of FTX in 2019, Bankman-Fried has been vocal in support for Democratic candidates. Bankman-Fried was one of the major donors to President Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign, contributing $5,220,000 from FTX US and $6,242,800 from Alameda Research. He claims to have made big contributions to Republican political candidates while concealing his involvement.There is a possibility that all funds donated to the Democratic and Republican parties will be returned. A precedent was established in 2009 when a former Democrat Party fundraiser who had given billions of dollars, was sued for violating election laws by making donations to political campaigns in other people’s names and was forced to return the money. Up to $73 million in donations could be retrieved to reimburse the exchange’s creditors.Currently, political figures who have received hefty donations from Bankman-Fried are consulting attorneys; some have already resorted to donating their money to charity in an effort to separate themselves from the fallen company and its donations."

Consumer price barely rose, leading to the smallest annual inflation rate of 7.1%. The news prompted a break out of Bitcoin price as it rallied toward a long awaited zone – $18,500. But will this pump in price be sustained? We think not, and here’s why. This recent Bitcoin price rise sets Bitcoin at a very dangerous zone. The market is falsely hoping for a recovery while danger lies in wait. On top of this news, Jerome Powell, FED chairman said he sees even smaller Fed rate hikes moving forward. Such words put hopes in the hearts of many crypto traders – a fatal mistake.The charts never lie. Something bad is coming after this ‘scam’ pump. This increase in price only hastens the big fat dump that was already programmed into the Bitcoin price by end of December 2022. The market generally looked forward to an inflation of 7.3% and hence anything lower than this was good news. 🚨BREAKING: US inflation CPI Data falls to 7.1%, lower than expectations 7.3%, Previous 7.7%🚨Super Bullish News for Crypto, #Bitcoin Exploding NOW And true to the news, Bitcoin jumped 5-6%, a move that was reflected with a lot of green in the altcoins. Stocks also printed positive increases in price amid this news. But celebrating before the game is over has never been a good idea.  The coming weeks will inflict max pain on the crypto markets. If you have been reading our Bitcoin price analyses, then you would be aware of the ‘hunch’ we’ve been following about a possible market crash on the week of December 20th – next week! The closer we get to this possible black swan event, the more the technical indicators play out to strengthen the narrative. The Bitcoin chart is primed for a 40-50% drop that will leave the market totally devastated. If we break the strong support between $16,242 and $15,631, then we could head down as low as $8,000. This is a call to secure your funds in stablecoins."
2022-12-09 10:41:30+00:00,Market Wrap Bitcoin: Is It A Recovery Or Is It A Bull Trap?,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-is-it-a-recovery-or-is-it-a-bull-trap/,"The Bitcoin daily chart shows signs of weakness as it has consolidated for the last 7 days. As investors remain confused on where Bitcoin is headed, the asset has shown recent short-term strength rising 2.32% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin is currently trading at $17,225. Let’s break it down. Last week’s analysis introduced a new indicator (to these articles) of charting – the Elliott Wave. The indicator predicted a short-term uptrend before a heavy downward move that will leave the marker devastated. As has been stated severally in these analysis articles, rumors have it that the black swan event may be on Christmas week. In the meantime, Bitcoin was expected to continue its short-term rise to around $18,500 before the crash came. At current prices, the asset is around $1,000 – $1,500 off from this target. Traders who are long should be weary. As we approach christmas week, the safest play is to remain in stable. But the trend will continue to be upward, possibly for the entirety of the coming week. That will be a +6.6% increase in the price of Bitcoin before the moment of truth arrives Bitcoin broke out of a descending triangle pattern – a bearish continuation pattern. Although descending triangles usually break to the upside most of the time, when they break down, the move is usually aggressive. This Christmas is not going to be a fun one for anyone caught with their pants down."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2022-12-05 15:36:46+00:00,How To Read Bitcoin Prices And Trends,https://blockzeit.com/how-to-read-bitcoin-prices-and-trends/,"Reading Bitcoin (BTC) prices and trends is essential to trade this cryptocurrency. When you know how, you can make wiser trading decisions and anticipate whether to buy or sell your BTC. The best way to know how to read its prices is to understand how BTC charts work.  You can easily predict the price movements of BTC through the charts, whether the price movement is yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, or every minute. Doing this can help you minimize your risk since Bitcoin is one of the most volatile digital currencies. For instance, its price plummeted to USD$34,000 in May 2021 after soaring to more than USD$60,000 in April 2021. Because of that, you need to learn how to read the charts, which is equivalent to reading Bitcoin prices and trends. Besides, you can read the charts to conduct technical analysis. You essentially use an asset’s price movement, volume, and other statistical trends to enter the market. That way, you can identify trading opportunities or trends when buying Bitcoin in Australia or anywhere else in the world. Knowing the two main formats of Bitcoin charts is critical. Understanding them allows you to identify which chart is suitable for your preference. Here are the formats:  This is the most basic chart of Bitcoin and other cryptos. It displays BTC’s historical price points made up of daily closing prices, depending on the time frame. A time frame can range from years, months, weeks, days, hours, or minutes. A HODLer—‘hold on for dear lifer’—is a trader who holds the BTC for an extended period. They generally use the monthly time frame. On the other hand, short-term traders use a lower time frame, such as hours and minutes.  In addition, a line chart has two scales: logarithmic and linear. A log chart allows you to identify trends, while a linear chart helps determine the speed of price changes. As for representation, a vertical shift represents a log chart shift since you can change the scale of Bitcoin prices through percent changes. On the other hand, the price scale represents a linear chart. The second most common chart in trading or investments of crypto or forex is the candlestick chart, also known as a price chart. You can use it to see the price movements of BTC during a specified time frame through the candlestick figures. With this chart, you can see the changes in price between low, high, close, and open.  In a candlestick chart, you can see green and red candles. Each candle has wicks and a body. The body of the candle represents the opening and closing prices of an asset. Red candles mean the price is declining, while green candles signify that price is going up. That means the close is at the top, and the open is at the bottom of the green candle’s body. Alternatively, the close is at the bottom, and the open is at the top of the red candle’s body. The candle’s wicks stretch from the body’s top and bottom, representing the lowest and highest prices BTC hits during the time frame.  You also need to understand the components of a chart to help you read BTC prices much easier. Some of these are as follows:  Undoubtedly, you’ll have a learning curve understanding all these components. Still, applying what you’ve learned pays dividends when you predict BTC prices correctly. Bitcoin investment or trading is popular these days because of the possibility of generating high returns on your investment. However, you need to know how to read Bitcoin prices and trends to achieve such a benefit. This means knowing the different chart formats and what goes into a chart. That way, you can anticipate the price movements of Bitcoin, helping you decide when to buy or sell."
2022-12-02 08:40:50+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Bulls Trapped as Elliot Wave Predicts Crash to 13K!,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-bulls-trapped-as-elliot-wave-predicts-crash-to-13k/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is on track for its most significant monthly loss in five months, having plunged 18%. While the asset is clearly down for the year, it has been showing signs of strength the past couple of weeks, especially the past two days. Perhaps this is an effect of FTX Ex-CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried’s interview where he said that FTX is actually solvent. Whatever the case, Bitcoin is showing short term strength and setting up the mother of all bull traps for the bearish traders. Here’s the full analysis. In last week’s analysis, BTC took a short-term retracement toward the 20-SMA, which would put BTC at around $17,400. If the price broke above the 20-day SMA on the upside, a possible bullish trend in the short term would be in play. The next potential resistance (the 50-day SMA), would be at $18,500.  However, until Bitcoin clears these areas and hills above the prolonged red resistance zone at the second lower high from the top. Traders should expect a crash at any time from that point. The next target for Bitcoin sits at around  $17,700 to $18,950. We hoped that the following week might be turning green for Bitcoin.  Bitcoin may continue the upward move to the 0.5 Fibonacci level which sits around $18,200 to $18,950. This level coincides with the 2-5 Cycle Wave trend line, which should move the price to close under these critical levels. This will necessitate the emergence of the 5th Wave Scenario (5) hence achieving the $13000- $14000 targets with ease. This could be the last impulse move (5) in the Elliott Wave before Bitcoin reverses and becomes bullish. Therefore, traders should be cautious of being liquidated out of risky long positions.  Should any fundamentals break these Elliott Wave or Fibonacci Levels, our analysis will be rendered useless.  As of the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is $16,938.68. This is a change of -1.78% over the past 24 hours. So far this year, Bitcoin has a change of -62.98% with more red weeks coming up. Prices are still expected to crash to cover the last bearish leg before the bull market begins.

2022-11-28 07:40:22+00:00,Bitcoin Weathers the FTX Storm-For Now,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-weathers-the-ftx-storm-for-now/,"Despite a new round of news only bears could love, Bitcoin’s price held up surprisingly well last week. However, FTX contagion risks remain and continue to be a drag on the market. The FTX scandal has drawn comparisons to the Bernie Madoff and Lehman Brothers scandals. Trust in centralized exchanges is eroding as Bitcoin flows into self-custody wallets reach record levels. Monthly Bitcoin exchange outflows reached a new high of 106,000 BTC, according to Glassnode. Increasing self-custody is generally a positive for prices because it indicates a high demand vs. supply. The current situation, on the other hand, is causing a bank run, testing exchange liquidity, and cascading insolvencies. According to the Wall Street Journal, the crypto lending platform BlockFi is preparing to file for bankruptcy. The company has acknowledged that it has significant exposure to the FTX exchange. The announcement comes after BlockFi suspended customer withdrawals last week. Withdrawals have also been halted at the AAX exchange in Hong Kong. On Twitter, there are also reports of Gate.io’s possible insolvency. Genesis Global Trading’s lending arm temporarily halted existing user withdrawals and new loan originations. Soon after, the cryptocurrency exchange run by the Winklevoss brothers, Gemini, halted redemptions on its Genesis-linked Earn product. Following reports of problems at Genesis Global Trading, the cryptocurrency community has demanded proof of reserve from asset manager Grayscale. Grayscale, which is owned by Digital Currency Group, is backed by approximately 634,000 BTC for its GBTC product. According to reports, the company keeps its Bitcoin in reserve at Coinbase, run by Brian Armstrong. However, it refused to provide on-chain proof for security reasons. The average on-chain trend is showing signs of bottom formation. However, given the euphoria of last year and the massive void left by FTX, the cleansing period could be more painful. Unfortunately, the dust on the FTX story has not yet settled, at least not by much. As a result, we do not believe we have reached the bottom. According to the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), between 73 and 81 percent of retail Bitcoin buyers lose money on their investments. This was previously the sweet spot from which Bitcoin drawdowns reversed. We will argue, however, that Bitcoin has never experienced a crisis on the scale of FTX. As a result, its price could drop by as much as 90% from its peak this year or next. This theory is supported by two strong pillars: the current retreat of retail buyers and the lack of interest among whale buyers. Furthermore, we can draw parallels to the 1929 Wall Street Crash. There was a lot of excitement leading up to this event, with shoe shiners on the streets of New York and Chicago giving out stock tips to customers and a market euphoria that led both small and large investors to believe they couldn’t lose money. We’ve said it before, and it needs repeating. Never risk more money than you can afford to lose. While many see this latest crash as a historic buying opportunity, history tells us that it will not be the last, and prices could fall much further."
2022-11-25 11:38:42+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Shows Signs of Short-Term Recovery,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-price-shows-signs-of-short-term-recovery/,"The FTX contagion seems to be spreading fast among companies that have invested in FTX. President Joe Biden, came out and emphasized on the need for regulations on Bitcoin and crypto as a whole. Moreover, and rather suspiciously, JP Morgan Chase bank and other central banks have suddenly begun Pilot testing CBDCs.  Amid all these events, Bitcoin price has been slowly bleeding. This week it’s barely different. In Last week’s analysis, we expected Bitcoin to break lower this week, lower than $15,800. And for a while there it did, before the price action suddenly bounced back up. This invalidated our downward prediction, albeit for a mere moment. Bitcoin defied the bearish pennant and price action finally managed to paste a falling wedge pattern. Falling wedges have a 67% chance of breaking to the upside and this is exactly what bitcoin did. According to the chart above, BTC is taking a short term retracement toward the 20-SMA. This would put BTC at around $17,400. Should the price break above the 20-day SMA on the upside it will be bullish on the short-term. Bitcoin would then rise to meet the next possible resistance, the 50-day SMA ($18,500) Bitcoin continues to trend below the last major support-turned-resistance. Until Bitcoin clears these areas and rises above the prolonged red zone, traders should expect a crash at any time. Moreover, there is still the potential black swan event in December that might send Bitcoin below $12,000. Bitcoin now is retesting the upper trend line of the falling wedge before continuing higher. The next target for Bitcoin is the 200 EMA that sits at around  $17,700 to $18,350. Next week might be green for Bitcoin, but the month of December will eventually end up red. 🚨The FTX hacker address has transferred its remaining ETH to the new address in batches of 15,000, with 195,000 ETH (~$217 million) transferred. The transferred ETH is expected to be converted into BTC again. pic.twitter.com/JcJxEKUDQd NB: The FTX hacker still has over 150,000 ETH that he is getting ready to dump on to the market. This will have some devastating effect on the price of Bitcoin and entire crypto markets."
2022-11-18 09:10:01+00:00,Market wrap: Bitcoin Consolidates Below Critical Support-Turned-Resistance,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-consolidates-below-critical-support-turned-resistance/,"After the ruckus last week on account of the FTX drama (which by the way has only intensified), Bitcoin shot down like a comet, taking with it the entire crypto market. Many large caps posted lower double digit losses while microcaps were completely destroyed. In the days following the major FTX bankruptcy news break, Bitcoin has seen some (quite suspicious) price trends, which can only be attributed to price manipulation. In last week’s analysis, we revisited an old pattern that became apparent back in July, 2022. The pattern is a ‘Staircase Down’ (staircase to hell if you like) kind of pattern and we are currently on the third step of this staircase.  How low does the staircase go? Only time will tell. The other noticeable thing we saw was that the consolidations became longer and longer after every fall/crash. The longer the consolidation the, the harder the crash. Well, Bitcoin has been consolidating below the critical support of $17,600. This previous support has now turned resistance, which is not good news for Bitcoin. This shows a lot of weakness on the part of the bulls. Moreover, on the 4-hour chart, the sideways movement resulted in the formation of a descending triangle, a bearish continuation pattern. Things are not looking good for crypto.  The descending triangle threatens to push Bitcoin price down to between $10,600 and $12,000, which coincides with the additional -32%  fall we are expecting in this bear market. Read more on descending triangles here. The FTX news is doing a great job sending the markets to Helheim on its own, but the steam seems to be dying down, especially as evidence emerges that Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) might have been a U.S government project to infiltrate crypto and blow it up from the inside.  This notion has been further supported by the fact that mainstream media refuses to portray SBF as the reckless investor and criminal he is and instead paints him as a saint who helped crypto discover the need for regulations! just insane reporting from the new york times. SBF owns a $40M penthouse and a private jet. pic.twitter.com/6Mu58EKO9u Hey @nytimes I am disappointed in you for somehow covering one of the biggest financial frauds of all time in a positive and glamorous light.I know you can do better. 👀😔 pic.twitter.com/xG8KrYvWLv It's now known SBF is a pathological lying fraud. @nytimes @yaffebellany response is to interview him, barely acknowledge his crimes and distribute his narrative (ambition, wealth, bad management, philanthropy, rivalry). This is not journalism, it's PR.https://t.co/0u0AGkchcj We have also received word (more like rumors) of another possible black swan event just before Christmas. We can speculate much on it, but it is better to be safe. One way or another, the markets are going down. Stay safe and DYOR!"
2022-11-11 10:25:03+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Slumps Downward As FTX Frenzy Rattles the Markets,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-slumps-downward-as-ftx-frenzy-rattles-the-markets/,"This week the much-awaited black swan event finally happened, causing Bitcoin to crash. FTX, the market-leading crypto exchange deep in bed with the U.S government was the latest to become insolvent. The feud between CZ of Binance and Sam Bankman-Fried of Alameda Research did little to salvage the problem. Last week’s analysis predicted further ranging between $20k and $21k. But we couldn’t have possibly foreseen what transpired this week. Normally, all things are held constant, technical analysis is pretty reliable. However random shifts in market fundamentals can alter technical analysis by a lot.  Since the beginning of the month, November promised positive gains for traders and investors alike. And we were off to a good start, expecting some more liquidity hunting for another two or more weeks before the market finally went up. FTX happened. Bitcoin continued rising steadily and finally breached the buy-side liquidity pool, taking out the buy stops. At this point, everyone in the space was crying  ‘Bull Season!”. However, this was not meant to be.  For some time now, despite the market showing signs of recovery, everyone had a hunch that the bear season was not over yet. This is because taking an average of the length of the previous bear seasons, this one was supposed to last at least 15-18 months. That would put its end somewhere between mid to late 2023.  In addition to that, many traders, after comprehensive analysis had concluded that Bitcoin’s bottom would be around $10k to $13k.  I’m just here to tell you to brace for more blood. Max pain.$BTC #Bitcoin $UBT #Blockzeit $PRVD $ETH $LINK $BNB Read my previous analysis (last week) here: https://t.co/mHjTWyl0EaTargets: 13K –> 6KNext update tomorrow.cc: @BlockzeitE (Give them a follow) pic.twitter.com/TJmt3X5cGC Going back to the Bitcoin price analysis of July 7, 2022, we predicted a Bitcoin fall of 34% that would set it at $13k. This 34% number was arrived at by taking an average of the previous two crushes. Doing some fresh calculations we come up with some more insight into the matter. The first thing to notice is that the consolidations become larger and larger as we crash further downwards. The longer the range the harder the crash.  Following this analysis, we come up with two possible outcomes for November, and the rest of the months leading up to the end of the bear market. Either way, Bitcoin falls. Stay safe."
2022-11-08 08:00:00+00:00,Optical Bitcoin is more than just a hype,https://blockzeit.com/optical-bitcoin-is-more-than-just-a-hype/,"Optical Bitcoin has been in the digital domain for a significant period, and the way it came to the fore is indeed something to be surprised at. In addition to this, we also got to understand the level that OBTC is currently operating at, which is quite exceptional for a lot many causes. The prices of prominent digital assets are bound to fluctuate just because of the level that they are usually believed to operate. What makes crypto trading a great way to realize the financial benefits in the market, and what derives its growth? Well, the fact that an increased number of people have so easily gravitated towards it all is indeed worth mentioning, and the understanding is also increasing among traders in real time. For more detail https://bitcoin-loophole.live Today, traders look forward to a robust flow of information that can help them to make wiser decisions in the market, and they certainly need an additional source of information that they can use to become aligned with the current crypto trends. Hence, platforms like the Bitcoin trading platform pave the better way for all such traders that aim to penetrate the market without much difficulty. You can also rely on this platform for so much exposure when it comes to the crypto trading scenario, and that is indeed a way to recognize the importance of knowledge dissemination.  The current trends in the market are massive, and they have to be interpreted just the way they are so that suitable decisions can be made down the line. Now, the platform is being widely accepted as a better medium that facilitates all the necessary information when it comes to the industry that has thrived by leaps and bounds. The bitcoin trading platform is a holistic solution for all the traders that can make a difference in the digital market.  Now, it might be a little tricky every now and then, but one thing that needs to be thought about is that there can be an increased level of unpredictability down the line. The fully diluted market cap does hold a massive relevance in the market, and we need to understand that there can be so many new things that can certainly launch in the market. The OBTC is way ahead of its time, and it has pretty much displayed that pretty well, owing to the exclusiveness that it currently has. Not only that, but we also need to come to grips with the fact that OBTC can very well be the kind of sensation that people usually anticipate in the digital market all around the world.  Now, having said that, there are so many other cryptocurrencies, the likes of OBTC, that are also thriving at the same rate. Some of these cryptocurrencies are Ookeenga, BabyApeFunClub, SaitaReality, Artizen, Tazor, MetaBridge, Lingose, OCEANA Waters, Sweat Economy and many more. Right now, we have to figure out which cryptocurrency can work out wonders for us and which ones to completely avoid as of this moment. Here, we can certainly have an additional impact on the scenario, and there will be so many factors that can be considered in this particular scenario.  OBTC is just in line with the current advancement processes, and it very well understands the processes to a great extent, and none of it can be overlooked or denied. There is a complete emergence of so many other cryptocurrencies in the current digital ecosystem, and that stresses the fact that we have ample pieces of evidence to be on the lookout for. OBTC will certainly not be underestimated anymore and considering the leeway that it has provided to an increased volume of customers.  Now, the expectations are undoubtedly high, and we have to keep moving in tandem with the current scenario to bring an additional benefit. The prospects of wealth maximization are also given much importance as far as the last couple of years is concerned. We have to acknowledge the differences and understand the underlying dynamics of the current economic market in its entirety. There will be immense benefits to look forward to very soon. "
2022-11-04 09:12:24+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Consolidation Amid FOMC Intrest Rate Hikes,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-consolidation-amid-fomc-intrest-rate-hikes/,"The markets have been rumbling this week, especially in anticipation of the FOMC interest rates decision on Wednesday. When the decision finally arrived, +75 BPS (as usual), the market reacted by sharply rising before tanking back down.  Bitcoin however took the opportunity to further cement its long-due breakout from the multi-month descending triangle.  Let’s take a look. Bitcoin broke out nicely according to last week’s analysis. The asset is still bullish, in case you were wondering. However, the smart money seems to have not finished accumulating. Currently, Bitcoin’s price sits at $20,575. After Friday, 28 October 2022, BTC went into consolidation mode, ranging throughout the whole week. Range chart patterns are usually used to stop out traders and clear liquidity build-up on both the buy side (BSL) and sell side (SSL). What this means is that most conventional traders like to set their stop losses below the ‘support’ or above the ‘resistance’ believing the price won’t cross these limits. This builds up liquidity in these zones. Smart money, A.K.A Exchanges, ensure they take out all of these liquidity pools before pushing prices in the direction they want. This results in liquidations like the ones below: In the image above, on November 2, 2022, the large candle indicated in the Bitcoin chart above resulted in the liquidation of $53.28M worth of Shorts and $126,184M worth of Longs across 9 of the largest crypto exchanges. Institutional players must take out the liquidity on both sides leaving behind a chart that looks more or less like the illustration below. The price of the asset enters consolidation and the smart money pulls liquidity hunts toward the end of the range before moving aggressively in the direction of the general trend – in this case, up. Checking out the Bitcoin chart, we can see that so far there has been one tiny liquidity hunt on the BSL. Knowing how exchanges are hungry for traders’ money, it is unlikely they will leave this range without pulling a few more hunts. This leads us to conclude that next week bitcoin will still be in the $20k to $21k range with occasional Sell Side and Buy Side liquidity hunts. If you are a trader, this week is not a good week to be in the Bitcoin market. However, after the range, the smart money will push Bitcoin to the upside. This is unlikely to happen in the course of next week. Cheers, and stay safe in the markets. Current Price: $20,575 Verdict Next Week: Range Between $20k and $21k Verdict November: Bullish"
2022-10-31 08:41:22+00:00,How Much Bitcoin Has Been Lost Forever?,https://blockzeit.com/how-much-bitcoin-has-been-lost-forever/,"Bitcoin has a market cap of $398B and remains the apex cryptocurrency. Interestingly, nearly four million bitcoins could be lost forever. A report by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis estimated between 2.78 and 3.79 million bitcoins were lost-as much as 23% of bitcoins in circulation today could have- been lost for good. Of the existing 18.5 million bitcoin, about 20 percent – worth about $140 billion at this point – seem to be in lost or otherwise locked-up wallets.     Despite bitcoin being designed with a finite supply of 21 million coins, Cane Island Digital Research estimates only a maximum of 14 million bitcoins will ever circulate because of how quickly coins are lost.     Once 21 million bitcoins are mined, that is all that will ever exist, and more than 18.89 million of the total supply has been mined in the 12 years since it was released in 2009. That is from the total nearly 19 million circulating today, and a max supply of 21 million coins once bitcoin is mined completely.  That means in the next couple decades, the new bitcoins created by mining would amount to just 14% of the market cap circulating, which would amount to fewer than 3 million.       The ceiling means that, short of radical changes in the mechanism for supplying bitcoin, it will never exceed 21 million BTC in circulation. Despite being mined, since a significant portion of the circulated supply has been lost to mining, the real number of BTC available for use or exchange is far less than the circulated supply suggests.  Given the estimated 20% of bitcoins ($150 billion) lost permanently, the actual amount of available BTC is far lower than the total supply.   Based on the estimates and calculations above, we can conclude that 3.61m BTC are currently lost, accounting for one fifth of the supply. At the same time, the losses bring bitcoins ultimate limited supply down to 17.39 million, which could be good news for bitcoin holders. There are only about two million remaining bitcoins left to mine, and 3.7 million lost coins may increase as a proportion of the total available supply.     Through research into production times, there are estimates that about 3.61 million bitcoins were permanently lost in the form of dead coins. The implications of this amount of coins lost are potentially enormous to the cryptocurrency’s price. Millions of dollars of bitcoin, as well as other digital assets, are lost each year. Depending on how the bitcoin price compares with the dollar, media outlets have reported losing billions to tens of billions worth of bitcoins for good.     In fact, it is estimated that over $100 billion worth of bitcoins have been lost — but at least one company says that some may have been recovered. While nobody knows the exact figure, an estimated one-fifth of bitcoins that were mined were lost, mostly because investors lost private keys.  A recent study says about a significant number of bitcoins were lost due to lost private keys, representing an interval between 68,110 and 92,855 bitcoins recoverable — or between $3.6 billion and $4.2 billion.       Bitcoins may also be lost when the bitcoin owner dies without sharing his or her private keys, or making sure that the private keys are retrievable by their intended recipients. Self-custody places responsibility for security and the risk of loss with the user; if the user takes complete self-custody of their bitcoins and loses their private keys, bitcoins are lost permanently.     Just like fiat currency notes may become damaged and lost by accident while storing and circulating, bitcoin private keys may become lost.  Lost bitcoins are still stored on the blockchain like any other bitcoin, but the lost coins are permanently dormant, as there is no way for anyone to ever find the private keys that will enable them to be spent again.     Today, there is talk about how up to 20% of the bitcoins supply could be lost forever because account holders cannot remember their passwords. Bitcoin users routinely misplace or forget passwords, analysis from The Wall Street Journal suggests, and unlike fiat currencies, which could be recovered, these lost tokens are extremely unlikely to be returned to circulation.     Blockchain analytics firms used their exact methodologies to establish that none of bitcoins mined in 2017 were lost, and out of the BTC used in strategic investments and buying/selling, only about 4 percent were lost permanently.  >>SIGN UP TO UPHOLD EXCHANGE NOW AND RECEIVE $50 IN BITCOIN<< Blockchain analysis companies think Satoshi’s original coin, one million coins worth, has been lost for quite some time, and between 30-50 percent of these Bitcoins which did not make any movement over the past couple years are missing as well.  According to a June 2020 report from Chainalysis, about 3.7 million BTC has been left untapped for at least half a decade — this is about $40.6 billion of Bitcoins that may never move again. And that is only bitcoin: An estimated 12,000 Etherereum were reported lost for good since 2018.     The supply of bitcoin is set to grow by less than 2 percent starting with the next halving in 2024, eventually dropping to less than 1 percent per year following the next block reward halving."
2022-10-28 10:04:37+00:00,Market Wrap: Bullish Bitcoin Breaks Out Upwards!,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bullish-bitcoin-breaks-out-upwards/,"A bullish Bitcoin broke out of the descending triangle this week, prompting many other altcoins to post double-digit gains. However, toward the end of the week (i.e today), the steam cooled off and the asset seems to be retracing. Well, today is the end of the trading week and the weekly candle will close in a few hours.  Let’s dive into the price action. Last week a bullish MACD cross confirmed that the trend was changing and Bitcoin was becoming bullish once more. The only thing that remained was for the price action to follow suit – and it did. On October 23, 2022, BTC broke up out of the descending triangle. In our previous article, we touched on descending triangles and how rare it is (37%) for descending triangles to break to the upside. This shows that the market has found its support. The bitcoin breakout was epic, but the RSI is still inside a falling wedge. RSI (Relative Strength Index) is a popular technical indicator used to evaluate market strength.  Scaled from 0 to 100, the RSI helps traders determine when an asset is overbought or oversold.  <=30 Indicates an oversold market while >= 70 shows the asset is overbought. In the BTC weekly RSI chart below, the RSI narrative holds true. When the asset became overbought, it signaled traders to sell, and the price came crashing down. The RSI hit oversold levels a few weeks back, flashing buying signals. Signal: Bullish Bitcoin hit a high of $21,012 before immediately cooling off around $20,000 regions. The area has a strong resistance, which could turn into support.  Should the asset hold in this area, we could see a move higher in the coming week, essentially confirming that November will be a bullish month. Bullish targets for Bitcoin in the future should be at $21,800, $22,700, and $25,000.For the bears in the house, Bitcoin is currently just above the 21-day EMA, and should the bears persist, this moving average should hold nicely. Currently, the 21 EMA sits at $19,600, making this price the bearish target for Bitcoin, should the sell of continue. The end of October is nigh. By the time we produce another weekly price analysis, we shall be in November. We opened October with bullish sentiments and our verdict for the month was always bullish. The price was $19,312 by the close of business on October 1, 2022. Today, the price is $20,101. The month ends in three days and we shall update the Bitcoin price as it shall be on the close of business on October 31, 2022. Novembear or Novembull? Find out in our next week’s article. Current Price: $20,101 Verdict Next Week: Bullish Verdict November: ???"
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2022-10-26 07:43:59+00:00,Reacting to Bitcoin Price Drops: 7 Key Indicators,https://blockzeit.com/how-should-investors-react-to-bitcoin-price-drops-7-key-indicators/,"If you bought $100 in Bitcoin in early 2010 and held it, you’d have more than $20 million today. With such high returns, it’s difficult not to think “Why not me?” Investing in cryptocurrencies is a high-risk proposition. The price fluctuates dramatically, and there’s no consistent pattern to the price increase or decrease. For example, the value of Bitcoin plummeted in 2020 when consumer prices began to increase, only to decline again in 2021 and 2022 in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Let’s look at  7 key indicators that investors should consider when evaluating Bitcoin. Uncertainty is a major concern for investors when it comes to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Unlike stocks and bonds, there is little evidence to support the idea that cryptocurrencies are safe investments. The price of bitcoin is subject to significant volatility. The volatility of the digital currency can be as high as 40 percent, and some analysts are still attempting to determine its fair value and determine important price levels.  For example, JPMorgan has estimated the fair value of bitcoin at $38,000 and compares its volatility to that of gold, which is a good hedge against economic uncertainty. The price of Bitcoin is affected by a number of factors, including the amount of uncertainty surrounding its future value. The price ratio of Bitcoin relative to the price of Tether is also influenced by uncertainty. In addition, it depends on the price of other currencies. While Bitcoin’s volatile price is a warning sign for investors, it is also an opportunity to learn about the cryptocurrency market. The cryptocurrency market’s supply and lack of central bank control are two major factors that cause its volatility.  While this may sound like a curse, crypto developers say it is a blessing. Lack of central control allows for a broader range of value creation than with conventional assets. Currently, there are no Bitcoin exchange traded funds available in the United States. However, if they were, they would likely exhibit similar volatility characteristics. The question of how investors should react to Bitcoin is a complex one. While the Bitcoin price has been soaring over the past couple of months, the risks and rewards are not the same as with traditional investments. For example, Bitcoin is still not a usable currency and investors have been selling it to people who don’t intend to use it. The Bitcoin price is also incredibly volatile, and if you sell it at the wrong time, you could suffer a large loss. Hence, investors should take this into consideration before investing in bitcoins. Digital assets are subject to regulation under the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Securities are investments that carry risks and require an investor to exercise their due diligence before purchasing them. Under the federal securities laws, exchanges must maintain certain standards in order to ensure the integrity of their markets and promote fair trade. If these standards are not met, investors may not be protected from losses. Several state governments are considering regulations for cryptocurrencies. The US Treasury has emphasized the importance of regulating the cryptocurrency market, citing the proliferation of international and domestic criminal activities.  For example, FinCen recently proposed a new regulation that would impose data collection requirements on digital wallets and exchanges. This rule is expected to be implemented by fall 2022. It will require exchanges and wallets to report any suspicious transactions and will require wallet owners to identify themselves when they send more than $3,000 in a single transaction. Futures markets are designed for investors who wish to speculate on how the price of a certain asset will behave in the future. These contracts are standardized and convey the right to buy or sell an asset at a future date. They have a specific number of units, pricing, and margin requirements, as well as a specific method of settlement. Traders can also buy and sell futures contracts in order to offset positions. Bitcoin futures contracts were launched last December by the CME Group and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange group. This study examines how Bitcoin’s spot market reacts to the launch of these contracts. It uses a combination of event-study methodology and an adjusted asset pricing model.  Findings indicate that the launch of futures contracts for Bitcoin initially drove prices up, but they subsequently declined. This behavior is consistent with the normal trading patterns after the launch of a new futures product. While Bitcoin has gained popularity in developed countries, many emerging markets have yet to see the same effect. However, the rise of this new cryptocurrency could help them achieve their financial goals.  For example, El Salvador recently became the first country in the world to officially recognize Bitcoin as legal tender. As a result, residents of the country are now able to pay taxes and settle debts with the currency. While the move was met with some opposition, some politicians from other parts of the region have also expressed support for legalizing Bitcoin.  However, El Salvador has spent $375M and lost $60M on their Bitcoin experiment. Although governments around the world initially took a hands-off approach to the new cryptocurrency, the rapid rise of the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies forced regulators to devise rules for this emerging sector. This could take several years, and the regulations differ widely. Some governments embrace cryptocurrencies, while others ban them altogether.  For regulators, the challenge is balancing traditional financial risks with innovation. The Pandemic has caused many to question the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies, but it also has many positive implications for the market. One study from Kingston University argues that Bitcoin exhibits the characteristics of both a currency and a speculative asset. The fact that Bitcoin is decentralized from the central financial system of any country makes it attractive as a haven for funds during times of crisis. Economists often refer to this phenomenon as the “flight to safety.” The study estimates that the COVID-19 pandemic has an equal impact on Bitcoin and the S&P 500. However, the volatility of Bitcoin explains about one-sixth of the variation in S&P 500 returns during the pandemic. This suggests that a sharp drop in Bitcoin prices could cause investors to become more risk averse and reduce their investment in stock markets. Moreover, spillovers from one crypto to another can be similar in magnitude. “Traders of any asset are fair-weather fans, and with major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum down more than 70% from their all-time highs, it’s little wonder that the shine has come off these coins,”  said James Royal, principal reporter at Bankrate. Declining Bitcoin prices along with prices for major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Cardano don’t help the cause of attracting new investors to the market. When prices are rising and FOMO kicks in it brings a lot of new investors into the space along with high expectations. As a result many investors don’t understand what they’re getting themselves into, lose money and pull out of the market. If you choose to invest, it’s important to maintain a diversified portfolio that includes several different types of investments to reduce your overall risk exposure. As a general rule, you should not invest more than 10% of your portfolio in risky assets such as Bitcoin."
2022-10-21 07:50:20+00:00,Bitcoin Market Wrap: Bullish MACD Cross Promises New Uptrend,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-market-wrap-bullish-macd-cross-promises-new-uptrend/,"Bitcoin is looking to make nice moves over the next few weeks as some positive indicators flashed on the weekly chart. Besides this, this week’s Crypto space has been blessed with at; least $1000 worth of APTOS airdrop, and people now have some free money to spend.  Will they use it to buy Bitcoin? Let’s dive into this week’s analysis and find out. Last week’s analysis found Bitcoin nearly at the end of a common market structure: The Descending Triangle. Since then, BTC has dropped by about $600  and is currently trading at $19,056. The multi-month descending triangle spells doom for Bitcoin, even though a new positive indicator just appeared. However, before we move on to the good news, here is a brief revisit to descending triangles. While 63% of the time, they break downwards, there is a 37% chance that we see a huge move to the upside.  It is possible to predict the direction of a breakout by combining market structure with other indicators. In this case, the additional indicator is the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD). The MACD is a technical indicator commonly used to identify a new trend (bullish or bearish). Generally, the blue line is the fast-moving average, while the red line is the slow moving average. When the fast-moving MA crosses from under the slow-moving MA, it indicates a new uptrend. On the other hand, if the fast-moving MA crosses from above the slow-moving MA, it indicates a new downtrend. The BTC chart below (Weekly) indicates several times in the lifetime of Bitcoin when bullish MACD crosses happened and the results on the asset’s price. If you look keenly, you can observe the crosses around 2015, 2019, and, most recently, a few weeks ago. Bitcoin might be seeing a move to the downside this coming week and might test the $18,500 region. In the 4H chart, Bitcoin ranges between $19,500 and $19,000. These two zones represent buy-side and sell-side liquidity. This means smart money and exchanges are using this range to suck retail traders dry before they push prices in one (pre-determined) direction. But what is this pre-determined direction? MACD says up, but the market structure says down. We are looking for a break in the market structure (A.K.A Market Shift) before we can conclusively say we are bullish or bearish. However, there are bullish undertones in the price action for the remaining months of 2022 going into 2023.Current Price: $19,056 Verdict Next Week: Range between $19,500 and $18,500 Verdict October: Bullish Seems like that APTOS stimulus cheque might just be used to buy BTC in anticipation of the bullish move coming in November."
2022-10-19 07:56:12+00:00,Top 8 Bitcoin Mining Stocks on NASDAQ,https://blockzeit.com/top-8-bitcoin-mining-stocks-on-nasdaq/,"If you want to invest in cryptocurrency during this bear market but don’t want to learn how to use a crypto exchange, manage cold wallet storage, or panic when bitcoin experiences a price crash, bitcoin mining stocks could be the solution. Investing in publicly traded companies that mine bitcoin provides exposure to the world of cryptocurrency while avoiding many of the risks associated with holding cryptocurrency, which is a deregulated, decentralized asset. But did you know that Bitcoin mining stocks, on the other hand, are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, easily traded on public exchanges through brokers or investment apps, and function similarly to any other stock? Yes, Bitcoin mining stocks check all those boxes. The best bitcoin mining stocks are currently trading lower than their year-ago highs. That is, before investing, it is critical to evaluate the company’s fundamentals and do your best to determine the true value of the mining company. When the bear market is behind us, these companies will be well-positioned to profit as the value of the assets they mine rises. Bitcoin has a total supply that is capped at 21 million and over 19 million bitcoin have already been mined. Factor in the millions of bitcoin that have been lost forever in dead wallets and the value of companies that specialize in mining bitcoin would naturally increase. A pick-and-shovel buy is an investment strategy in which the underlying technology required to produce a good or service is invested in rather than the final output. It is a method of investing in an industry without having to bear the risks associated with the final product’s market.  So, with Bitcoin mining stocks investors are making a bet that bitcoin will be around for a long time and despite fluctuations in price the equipment and technology needed to produce it will be in high demand.  Let’s take a look at the top 8 Bitcoin mining stocks on the NASDAQ that you can invest in today. Canaan has been rated as one of the best performing cryptocurrency mining stocks in recent months, with the fewest losses during this bear market. A strong quarterly earnings report in the second quarter of 2022, combined with its expertise in ASIC chips and being one of the first to market with bitcoin mining technology, gives it an advantage. Bitfarms, founded in 2017, now employs 50,000 miners across nine farms in four countries. The farms are powered by low-cost hydroelectric energy, which gives the company an advantage in an industry that has been chastised for its lack of sustainability. Its proprietary software and innovative management team promise global expansion, making it one of the best bitcoin mining stocks to invest in today. Bitfarms were also one of the best performing mining stocks in 2022, with the smallest declines. Riot Blockchain stock is currently on the rise as a result of a report on the amount of bitcoin mined in August, which was 15% lower than this time last year but 15% higher than in July 2022. With so much potential ahead of it, several analysts believe Riot is currently undervalued. HIVE Blockchain Technologies, like Bitfarms Ltd., mines bitcoin and ethereum with green energy. The company was the first to go public with its crypto mining operations. HIVE may be significantly undervalued right now, according to Zacks data. Analysts anticipate returns in the coming months. Folks in the know like Canadian mining firm Hut 8.  With four analysts recommending a “buy” rating and one recommending a “hold,” according to CNN. The stock is currently trading at $1.88, with a median target price of $4.75, a high estimate of $5.00, and a low estimate of $3.89. Hut 8 Mining is one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency mining companies. According to a company press release, the company has outstanding ESG Performance when compared to its peers and reported strong quarterly revenue of $53.3 million in the first quarter of 2022. Note: At the time of this article the Hut 8 website was down. No further information was available but stock was still listed and trading on the NASDAQ. Stronghold has been identified as one of the most undervalued bitcoin stocks by bitcoinist.com, which would make it a fantastic deal at its current price of $0.96. As more mining companies strive to make bitcoin mining more environmentally friendly, Stronghold is taking an innovative approach by powering its operations across Pennsylvania with reclaimed coal refuse. Core Scientific, the world’s largest bitcoin mining company, is currently focused on expansion. It sold the majority of its bitcoin holdings in June 2022 to pay down debt and add to their mining machine arsenal. B. Riley Principal Capital II also entered into a $100 million common stock purchase agreement with the Austin, Texas-based company. This will increase the company’s liquidity even further as it continues to streamline operations. As a result, CNN polled seven analysts, and seven of them said the stock is a “buy now.” The current price for CORZ is $1.05. Marathon Digital Holdings, in addition to Core Scientific, is one of the largest bitcoin mining operations in the United States. They have a mining facility in Hardin, Montana, that is co-located with Beowulf Energy, allowing Marathon to keep 100% of its mined bitcoin. Marathon’s location allows for significant growth. Marathon, unlike many of the stocks on this list, is not undervalued. However, experts believe that this will give the stock more long-term price stability. Speaking with a financial advisor or using a stock trading platform like TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, or Robinhood can make investing in bitcoin mining companies simple. Investing in mining companies can be a simpler way to gain exposure to bitcoin while the crypto winter continues to drive prices down. Yet, the same care and caution should be taken when considering investing in Bitcoin mining stocks as one would exercise when investing in any product or service. In our research, these Bitcoin mining stocks stand out as good investments. Hut 8 Mining, Stronghold, HIVE, and Canaan are all currently undervalued in the eyes of investors, making them a good buy. Because of their low trading prices, these stocks all have the potential for high returns at a low cost of entry.  Despite the fact that bitcoin trading and crypto-related investments, such as crypto ETFs and mining company stocks, are still considered highly speculative and thus high-risk, the low prices of these stocks can help investors get in the game with less risk.  Furthermore, because stocks are regulated by the SEC, they are less risky than investing directly in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. According to experts, bitcoin mining will still be extremely profitable in 2022 and beyond. Bitcoins mined today are worth less than they were in the early days of cryptocurrency due to a process known as halving, in which the rewards for mining bitcoins are reduced over time.  Miners would earn 50 BTC for each new block discovered and coin mined in 2009. The next halving is scheduled for 2024. Miners will receive 6.25 BTC for each coin minted until then. Bitcoin mining can be extremely profitable even at this rate.  Professional bitcoin miners can now earn $20 million per day, or $600 million per month. Large mining companies now dominate the industry due to the high cost of mining machines, which can range from $2,000 to $20,000, according to BuyBitCoinWorldwide.com.  Individuals can make the most money from bitcoin mining by investing in mining company stocks like the ones listed above, rather than trying to compete with giant commercial bitcoin mining operations. Core Scientific stands as the largest bitcoin mining company in the world. Giving longer-term price targets for bitcoin in 2030, DigitalCoinPrice suggested the coin could trade at a staggering average price of $103,524. While the algorithmic forecaster did not provide a bitcoin price prediction for 2040 or 2050, it did forecast that the coin could be worth $128,740 in 2031."
2022-10-14 13:10:49+00:00,Market Wrap Bitcoin: Technicals Spell Doom for the King of Crypto,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-technicals-spell-doom-for-the-king-of-crypto/,"Bitcoin price this week pushed up aggressively toward $20k. However, many industries still think BTC is due for a correction. Experts also think that bearish institutional traders might set a trap for unsuspecting retail traders. The word of the week is “Bear Trap.” Let’s dive in. Bitcoin last week showed promising signs of moving up higher, leading us to give a bullish verdict. However, from last week’s price of $19,977, BTC is trading at $19,736, indicating massive consolidation. From last week Friday, Bitcoin descended lower and even left a wick below the $18,433 (strong) support level. It was a horrifying moment for the markets as everyone entered panic, anticipating the asset’s collapse.  However, Bitcoin managed to close the day (October 13, 2022) above this crucial support zone – much to the relief of all crypto traders. Despite this relatively good news (of strong support), last week’s price actions brought Bitcoin near the end of a bearish market structure: A descending triangle. Descending triangles can form from any price trend direction. Moreover, break out can be in either direction. However, it usually breaks downward 63% of the time. Bitcoin is currently at the end of a descending triangle and might soon be up for a heavy move. The market might be in for a bad surprise this coming week as Bitcoin must pick a direction soon – and it seems it might be a bearish side. Although the article might be filled with instances of ‘bearish,’ ‘downward,’ ‘bad surprise,’ and ‘bear trap,’ in today’s analysis, we shall refrain from making a verdict as BTC is at a crucial decision zone. This is the best time to stay out of the market until the asset makes a definitive move in one direction."
2022-10-11 07:13:58+00:00,What Good is Bitcoin Anyway?,https://blockzeit.com/what-good-is-bitcoin-anyway/,"We hear a lot about Bitcoin, it’s current price, it’s all time high, if it’s rising or crashing and if in fact it is the future of money.  Bitcoin has been described as a hedge against inflation (it clearly isn’t) as well as digital currency(we’ve had that for years) that would free us from confiscatory banking fees, yet no one I’ve spoken with has ever used it to buy something or pay anyone for anything. So, nearly 14 years into the Bitcoin “revolution” we’re asking what good is Bitcoin anyway? Bitcoin is a digital currency that can be used to buy goods and services over the internet without the need for a financial intermediary between the buyer and the seller. At least that’s what we’ve been (sold) told. Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a decentralized ledger that is managed on a computer network. The ledger is updated autonomously and requires computers controlled by human operators to operate and connect to. Yet, transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain are painfully slow. Since its launch in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin was supposed to change the world of online finance by allowing users to bypass banks and other financial institutions. Today, that doesn’t seem to be the case. Do you know anyone or any business that regularly uses Bitcoin to pay for anything instead of hoarding it in the hopes that it will increase in value? I sure haven’t. That’s not to say they aren’t out there-I’m sure they are. But why, for example, would someone spend one bitcoin on something if the value might skyrocket the next day. Conversely, why would you accept bitcoin as payment if the value might plummet the next day? My finances (scraping by) are mostly digital. My checking account is a form of digital currency. I use it to pay all of my bills online for free, and payments received are deposited into it electronically. It’s all just ones and zeros that are moved around over the internet. Credit cards are a digital line of credit that I can use for a variety of transactions at a low cost to me because credit card providers charge a transaction fee to the seller, which is passed on to me in the form of a slightly higher price for my purchases.  Debit cards are a type of digital currency that allows for fee-free payment from one’s bank account. I never carry cash and can’t remember the last time I set foot in my bank or even approached an ATM to get cash. I don’t need to. PayPal is my go to app for transactions because it protects my credit card and bank account from scammers and identity hackers. And don’t forget about Venmo and other digital transaction platforms all over the world. So, how revolutionary is Bitcoin, really? According to The Economist, Brazil has launched the Pix payment system, which allows consumers and merchants to send and receive money using a QR code without sharing the details of their wallet, fintech provider, or bank. It has been enormously successful. The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) of India and other similar schemes, many of which are in African countries, have also gained widespread acceptance. So let’s take a step back and look at some use cases for Bitcoin as well as some advantages and disadvantages of the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin is a digital token that is issued by the Bitcoin network. The symbol for Bitcoin is BTC or XBT. It is also represented by the ‘₿’ symbol. It can be divided into 100 million satoshis, the lower denomination of the currency. Information about Bitcoins is stored on a decentralized ledger. This includes the token transaction history and digital address identifiers, among other data. The Bitcoin network is a decentralized network of computers that operates the Bitcoin ledger. Each computer connected to the network (a node) carries a part of the transaction database (the ledger), and some nodes may have the complete dataset.  The ledger itself is operated on a type of database called a blockchain. Transaction data in blockchains are stored in ‘blocks’ linked together by timestamps. The network chains several blocks together while recording new transactions over time. In the Bitcoin network, each transaction is encoded using cryptographic techniques. Data encryption keeps data relatively secure from hackers. As the Bitcoin network works independently, it is dependent on the work done by the network nodes to complete a transaction. Each computer has to locate the addresses of a Bitcoin transaction on the ledger by solving cryptographic puzzles.  The process is called mining. In simple terms, it is looking for a number called an SHA-256 value to add it to a corresponding block in the blockchain. Before adding a transaction, at least 3 nodes have to approve the transaction.  As more transactions accumulate, there is a need to add a new block. A node that successfully adds a new block is rewarded a fixed amount of Bitcoins. This algorithmic scheme is called ‘Proof-of Work’ (PoW). PoW algorithms favor computers with high processing power that can perform many cryptographic operations per second, allowing them to approve transactions more frequently. The overall supply of Bitcoins is limited to 21 million coins. While most of the coins have been mined, the remaining coins are expected to be fully mined in 2140. Bitcoin tokens are linked to a pair of addresses controlled by a user. To send or receive Bitcoins both addresses need to be used. While a public address is fixed, a private user address is generated in a way that makes it difficult to recreate it through another computer.  The private address is needed to verify ownership of a specific Bitcoin token on the network. Therefore, any user needs to keep this in a safe location. Since Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, it offers several advantages for users over traditional money. Bitcoin allows people to bypass banks and financial institutions subject to government regulations. Therefore, Bitcoin becomes a gateway for online transactions in regions where banking rules and regulations are very restrictive. Bitcoin is especially invaluable for persons and businesses that have difficulty accessing international currencies. Bitcoin technology, including the ledger, is open source. Anyone can view the Bitcoin ledger to see transaction history or confirm a pending transaction. The decentralized network can keep a persistent record of the blockchain network. If one computer leaves the network or gets compromised, other computers can continue verifying and recording the transaction. Cryptographic processes also deter hackers from easily accessing transaction information. Addresses on the blockchain are not associated with usernames. So transaction information does not directly reveal the parties involved. However, it’s worth noting that anyone can make their list to keep a record of suspicious bitcoin users. The bitcoin network is notorious for its high power usage. Studies have shown that it consumes up to 100TWh of annual electricity. This is equivalent to the electricity consumption of countries like Egypt and Ukraine. If the power is equated to fossil fuel usage, it has a high carbon footprint. According to economist Paul Krugman, while the inflation rate for most citizens is in the upper single digits, it is well over 100 percent for people who have their money in cryptocurrencies due to their whipsaw valuations. Fans of cryptocurrencies ask for patience, claiming that they are a relatively new mode of payment that is still in its early stages.  Really? Bitcoin, the most well-known and most valuable, has been around since 2009. Yet instead of decoupling from the stock market and the Fed rate it is now tied to it.   Why can’t you use Bitcoin to pay for groceries at your local market? Because the vendors are not confident in the ability of Bitcoin to maintain its value.  Hackers have started using more sophisticated techniques to breach the Bitcoin network. While there have been upgrades in recent years, users using legacy systems risk losing all of their digital holdings on the blockchain. Bitcoin’s market value is highly volatile. For every person getting rich through Bitcoin investing, several people have lost their savings or fallen prey to Bitcoin scams on peer-to-peer trading networks.  Governments advise cryptocurrency traders to be careful when buying them. Countries like China and Pakistan have made it illegal to use cryptocurrency. Additionally, Bitcoin has a long way to go toward mainstream adoption in many countries. Factors include a lack of awareness about Bitcoin and how to access it, low penetration rates of digital banking, and an unwillingness to buy Bitcoin because of market risks (scams and speculative trading). Bitcoin is apparently another way to buy things on the internet. One of the first things purchased by Bitcoin in the real world was a Papa John’s Pizza worth 10,000 BTC! ($41 at that time). Those pizzas today would be worth more than $300 million. Since then people have been buying many things through bitcoins like fast food (online deliveries), entertainment services, groceries, digital media, property, and much more. Again, why they would is anyone’s guess, but I sure wouldn’t. Would you?  Here’s a list of places that accept Bitcoin in case you are curious. Internet information and knowledge advocacy organizations like the Wikimedia Foundation, Electronic Freedom Fund, and the Internet Archive have been accepting Bitcoin for some time. Other organizations include charities such as UNICEF and the Rainforest Foundation. So Bitcoin is now a way to help others make the world a better place. When Bitcoin’s price started to soar (ultimately reaching a record high in November 2021), many cryptocurrency enthusiasts flocked to stash their currency holdings on the blockchain. Of course, these things never last, and the price crashed. So there is some risk in crypto investing. That has not stopped many from trying their hand at making a fortune.  New blockchains like Ethereum and Solana allow DeFI investing and staking options that represent an alternative route to minimize risks. However, you should always be careful before investing in any cryptocurrency. Today, many crypto exchanges trade several cryptocurrency pairs or allow withdrawals in Fiat currencies. Bitcoin is 100% guaranteed to be one of the primary cryptocurrencies featured in crypto exchanges. So if you are shopping for some altcoins, you can use bitcoin to buy some for yourself. Make sure you research the type of cryptocurrency and the transaction fees of the exchange you are buying. Yes, you read that right. Bitcoin casinos are a thing. Once again, we don’t recommend gambling. But this is where some folks prefer to risk their bitcoin. Of course just holding bitcoin is a risk. Just ask Michael Saylor. Unfortunately, Bitcoin’s anonymity and decentralized mechanism have allowed criminals to take advantage of it, tarnishing its reputation in mainstream media. Transactions can be used to launder money or buy illegal items and services without the interference of banks. Their activity has created an online space called the dark web where they can operate almost undetected. On a positive note, governments and law enforcement agencies have been working hard to track malicious agents using Bitcoin. And Bitcoin’s transparency is useful in identifying addresses associated with criminal activity. Bitcoin is a radical departure from traditional online payment systems as it gives people unprecedented levels of freedom. Although it has yet to go mainstream in many regions, people and businesses are steadily entering the Bitcoin fold. It is being used in many ways, and it’s likely here to stay. Perhaps you have already started using it, too? Let us know your thoughts on Bitcoin in the comments below!

2022-10-07 10:28:48+00:00,Market Wrap Bitcoin: Will Uptober Vibes Persist?,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-will-uptober-vibes-persist/,"Bitcoin has slowly slithered up this past week. It is hard for most investors and traders to identify opportunities in such market movements. Those who mainly benefit are long-term holders. Is it time to pick up a bag of Bitcoin for the bull season? Last week’s analysis saw bitcoin in a do-or-die position. The asset needed to choose a side. Did it, though? Well, it did (ish). The asset is currently just +3.11% from last Friday’s price at the analysis time.  While we’ll take a green day (even a small one) over a red one, traders expected a much more robust move from Bitcoin this past week. Other altcoins have been pumping in price, giving the impression that Bitcoin has found its bottom and the bull season is slowly returning. Bitcoin managed to trend out of the red zone (red box) and is now firmly in the larger blue region. In this region, BTC is expected to touch a high of $21,611 as it retests that resistance zone. The asset’s price is now trending above the 21-day EMA (green line), which is good news for the asset. The coming week might see a push further to the upside. BTC is retesting the 21 EMA after breaking above it on October 4.  If bulls have their way, the price should bounce off this moving average and head for the $21.5k region, a +7.97% increase.  If Bitcoin bests the $21.5k resistance, the asset could rise rapidly to test the 200-day EMA (thick white line), sitting at about $26,480. Other possible resistance points above $21.5k include $22.5k, $24,k and $24.5k Current Price: $19,977 Verdict Next Week: Bullish Verdict October: Bullish Do you think this October is like the other previous ones?

With technological advancement, everything has become convenient. The same is these in the case of cryptocurrency. With modern facilities of bitcoin trading platforms and bitcoin wallets, bitcoin buying, storing, and selling has become way too easy. For more information check: bitcode prime  Different places you can buy bitcoin: There are so many places or platforms through which you can buy bitcoins. They are: You can buy bitcoins through any of the above-mentioned platforms. Bitcoin ATMs are convenient but, they are not yet many now. However, if you choose online platforms they are multiple in numbers. You just have to choose a secure one that can be reliable. To Buy or sell bitcoin the best way is to register with its Official websitethat is the genuine one. However, the process of buying bitcoin through exchanges is: As physical money needs some storage to keep them safe, the same is needed for digital currency. When we own some bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency that are present online, we need online storage or them. These digital currencies can’t be extracted from the online medium because, having some bitcoins doesn’t mean that you have them in your pocket but, they remain in the Blockchain node as some alphanumeric data and you just own those bitcoins.  However, to access them you have your private and public keys and those keys are stored in your digital wallet. You can also not use a wallet but in that case, you will not have much security on your bitcoin holdings. A wallet means you have an extra level of security storage for your access keys thus your bitcoins are also safe. As we have already said, bitcoins are stored in Blockchain nodes and you only have their access by your public and private key, they are stored indirectly with the help of a digital wallet. The digital wallet keeps your keys safe. You can use the wallet by connecting with your computer or mobile when you want. To add an extra level of security, you should pay attention to sticking to adding a strong and secure password. To send or receive bitcoins, you need those keys. When you are sending some of your bitcoins to others you need the private key to access your bitcoin holdings. On the other hand, when you choose toreceive bitcoins from any 3rd party,, you will need a public key to share with the sender. Thus bitcoins are stored as well as trading through a digital wallet. Now, you can have different types of digital wallets that are categorized into the hot and cold wallets. If you want a safe wallet option you can go for a cold wallet. If your utmost priority is convenience over security, a hot wallet can be a better option. However, these wallets are connected to the internet and thus they are very much vulnerable to online fraud. The above information emphasizes the need for digital wallets and how they store bitcoins with the various kinds of trading platforms and bitcoin trading methods. We hope the information helps you understand the whole concept and ease up your bitcoin trading journey. "
2022-09-27 08:45:17+00:00,What Happens if Bitcoin Crashes to ZERO?,https://blockzeit.com/what-happens-if-bitcoin-crashes-to-zero/,"The cryptocurrency market can be very volatile and hard to predict, that comes with the territory. One month, a coin might be reaching an all time high, and the next, it might be dropping like a stone thrown from a bridge. When it comes to crypto, this is unfortunately just the way things work, which begs the question: What would happen if Bitcoin, the oldest and most valuable cryptocurrency asset in the world, crashed to zero? Because Bitcoin isn’t a stablecoin and isn’t tied to any real-world asset, it can crash just like many other cryptocurrencies. If you keep up with Bitcoin and its price, you may have noticed that you can’t always tell what will happen next. Putting money into crypto can be risky because many investors never see a crash coming. Bitcoin was worth about $67,000 at its all-time high in November 2021, but since then, its price has been all over the place. Bitcoin had a big crash at the beginning of 2018, another one in May 2021, and a third one in the same month it reached its highest value. At the time of this post Bitcoin is worth about $50,000 less per coin than what it was worth in November 2021. So, it’s safe to say that even the biggest coins can fall just as quickly as any other. But what if there was a crash that sent the price of Bitcoin all the way down to zero? Is this something that could happen, and what would happen if it did? Technically, the price of any cryptocurrency could fall to zero, as happened with Terra Luna. But for something as popular and valuable as Bitcoin to lose so much value, a lot of big changes would have to happen. To understand why this is the case, it’s important to know how Bitcoin works. People often buy Bitcoin as a long-term or short-term investment. Some people like to buy it when the price goes down because they think it will go up again and then sell it when it does. Others buy Bitcoin with the intention of keeping it for a long time, even if the price goes up and down after they buy it. Also, it would be very hard to get rid of the whole Bitcoin network, even if it became very hard to use or illegal in most countries around the world. With over 100,000 active nodes on the Bitcoin network spread all over the world, the blockchain could only be destroyed if all of these nodes stopped trusting or caring about Bitcoin.   Getting rid of Bitcoin wouldn’t be like getting rid of a website. It has a strong foundation that is hard to shake up, even if you are a powerful government. This is because it has a complicated infrastructure and is not centralized. Also, big players in the crypto industry can have a big effect on how much Bitcoin costs. Crypto whales are people or groups who own a lot of cryptocurrency and can use it to move the market when they think it’s necessary. If these whales don’t want Bitcoin to go to zero, they can stop this from happening in some situations. All of these things make it very, very unlikely that Bitcoin will completely crash. But there are other things going on that could hurt Bitcoin’s value. One of the most common reasons why people don’t like Bitcoin is that it isn’t backed by anything tangible. Some people also say that it isn’t used enough in the traditional economy for it to succeed. Of course, your country’s national currency is probably still a lot more useful to you in your day-to-day life than Bitcoin when it comes to buying things. This means that it is more useful than Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s future is also in danger because it is still hard to use on a large scale. As more and more people buy bitcoins, the number of transactions on the blockchain grows. This creates something called “latency,” which means that it takes miners a long time to check each transaction. Due to the small size of a Bitcoin block, the blockchain can only handle a certain number of transactions every minute. Many people think that this is Bitcoin’s weak point. Bitcoin’s price is also affected by a number of other things. Even a simple tweet from Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, caused a crash in 2021. This shows that Bitcoin is not a stable asset. It’s also important to remember that Bitcoin is, above all else, a commodity whose value depends on how much people want it. This also makes it very dangerous. So, let’s say the price of Bitcoin did fall to $0. What would happen to the market because of this? Let’s say that one day, every country in the world made it illegal to buy, sell, mine, or spend Bitcoin, and its price fell to $0. Even if the network itself stayed the same, such a drop would still cost millions of people all over the world a lot of money.  There would be no way to sell Bitcoin back to exchanges because they would be required by law to take it off the list of things that can be traded. In short, people who had invested in Bitcoin but hadn’t yet cashed out would be in an impossible situation. Also, the crypto mining industry would be hit hard by Bitcoin’s total collapse. Even just the Bitcoin mining market is huge, and many people depend on it to make a living. If Bitcoin lost all of its value and uses, the rewards for mining would drop to zero, and almost a million miners would have to find another way to make money. Mine farms would also have to close, which would put thousands of people out of work. Hundreds of other businesses, like those that accept Bitcoin payments, lend Bitcoin, or swap Bitcoin, would also be affected. In short, the end of Bitcoin would be terrible for millions of people. If Bitcoin crashed in this way, it would probably cause a lot of other cryptocurrencies to crash as well. After all, if investors see that the biggest coin on the crypto market has lost all value, it’s likely that many of them will cash out as soon as possible to avoid more losses. All in all, if Bitcoin goes down, it’s likely that a lot of other cryptos will go down with it. There’s no doubt that if the price of Bitcoin dropped to zero, it would be a disaster for the crypto industry. But there are very few chances that Bitcoin will suddenly crash in this way. Even though some things could make Bitcoin’s value go down over time, it would take big changes in the economy and government, as well as the destruction of the Bitcoin network, for Bitcoin’s value to drop quickly to zero. Have you bought Bitcoin yet? If not, purchase your Bitcoin with our test winner eToro! Even though a Bitcoin crash to zero would be bad, it’s also important to think about how it would affect the global financial markets. Some experts think that a drop in the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies wouldn’t have much of an effect. But when you think about the fact that some of the biggest cryptocurrency companies, like Crypto.com, Binance, and BitPay, all have sponsorship deals with companies (usually in the sports industry), it seems likely that at least some damage would be done. How much damage? That’s difficult to assess. When the price of Terra Luna crashed to zero earlier this year, there was almost no reaction from the financial markets around the world. But Bitcoin is probably a different story, if for no other reason than its adoption by Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan Chase, Social Capital, Greyscale and ARK Investments, to name a few. This institutional adoption lends more credence and stability to Bitcoin, something that most other cryptocurrencies do not enjoy. The key with Bitcoin is the blockchain technology which underpins it, not so much the currency itself.

2022-09-23 08:47:27+00:00,Market Wrap: Is BTC Price Being Heavily Manipulated?,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-is-btc-price-being-heavily-manipulated/,"This week investors and traders anticipated the FED interest rates hike, and almost everyone expected the price of stocks and Bitcoin to crash. However, on September 21, FOMC raised the interest rates by 0.75 percentage points, but the markets remained afloat. You would expect prices to react extremely negatively to interest rates being raised three times in a row, right? Wrong! It is clear that Bitcoin price manipulation is real, and it is heavy.  Nevertheless, we still analyze the charts. Here is what Bitcoin did this week. Last week’s analysis was bearish. Market makers had successfully stopped hunted traders at the $21k range, liquidating $273 million worth of BTC Longs.  As of Last week’s analysis, Bitcoin was trading at $19,843. The bears looked mighty and powerful as there was so much room to the downside. However, $19,500 would be a strong support zone, and the bears needed some heavy Fud if they were going to break this support. Well, the Fud came on September 21. The Fed raised interest rates again – the third time in a row. While the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq did fall by an average of -1.7%, it was not as serious as anticipated.  On the other hand, Bitcoin maintained its grip on the $19,500 mark – or at least it tried. The asset fell slightly below this support to hit our target of $18,590, a cool +60.18% if you were shorting BTC on 10X leverage. Despite the bad news, there were more BTC Long liquidations ($206.036M) on September 21 than BTC Shorts liquidated ($112.281M), which makes no sense. Since then, however, Bitcoin has bounced back, further solidifying $18k-19k as strong support and a possible bottom for this Bitcoin cycle. For Bitcoin long-term investors, this might be where you want to begin accumulating. In addition, Bitcoin is still in a legitimate breakout pattern. Normally, when the price breaks out of any pattern, there is a pullback or retest before the price pushes further in the breakout direction.  On the daily chart, Bitcoin is almost finishing its retest. Could we see fireworks in the days or weeks to come? Very likely. The $18k-$19k support has been revisited 5 times in the last four months and has held the price firmly. Bitcoin might rise further in the coming weeks to around $20,143 before facing more resistance. If it breaks this resistance, then the next target is $21,611. There is not much in play for a Bitcoin bearish scenario right now because of the extremely strong four-month-long support. The only scenarios highly probable currently are bullish or consolidation. Current Price: $19,351 Verdict Next Week: Bullish Verdict September: Bearish"
2022-09-20 09:19:48+00:00,Bitcoin Scammers Are Using Celebrity Endorsements From Jeff Bezos in Social Media Ads,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-scammers-are-using-celebrity-endorsements-from-jeff-bezos/,"Fake celebrity endorsements are one of the most popular ways for scammers to lure in victims, and they are using celebrities like Elon Musk, Martin Lewis, Richard Branson, Didi Taihuttu, and more to convince people that their Bitcoin scams are legit. Every day, countless social media users are greeted by seemingly legitimate ads featuring Jeff Bezos promising a great Bitcoin investment opportunity. However, these ads are put there by scammers with no connections to the well-known founder of Amazon. Instead of providing a real opportunity, these ads direct you to scam websites like Bitcoin Era and countless others, where any money you supposedly invest is simply stolen by scammers. So many of these fraudulent schemes center on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They’ve been doing this for years, ever since Bitcoin first arrived on the scene in 2009. Because there aren’t robust regulations around crypto, law enforcement has few tools available to crack down on these scams. That’s why they’re found on just about every platform online and continue to claim victims to this day. These scammers know which celebrities to choose for their fake endorsements to have the greatest effect. They choose Jeff Bezos because he’s incredibly rich from founding the only shopping giant Amazon. Any investor would put a lot of weight on anything he has to say based on his track record of amazing success. Jeff Bezos was formerly the world’s richest man until Elon Musk took that title, so it’s clear to see why people might take his investment advice.  This is doubly true when it comes to get-rich-quick schemes like Bitcoin 360 AI. We saw a variety of fake advertisements and a lot of sponsored content. However, a quick search for Bitcoin 360 AI review has helped shed light on this latest scheme. Unfortunately, the scams that these websites lead to aren’t real investment opportunities from Jeff Bezos. Instead, they’re posed as investment opportunities that provide fast returns with no risk, only for anyone who sends money to never see it again. The scammers set people up with high hopes of having found the next exclusive opportunity, but victims soon find out that they’ve lost everything. This specific type of Bitcoin scam has become incredibly widespread, and they aren’t only using Jeff Bezos, either. This same scam and others like it are using other celebrities like Richard Branson, Elon Musk, Martin Lewis, Didi Taihuttu of the Bitcoin Family, and many more in almost identical fake ads. They cast a wide net to catch as many scammers as possible, hoping that someone will trust these fake celebrity endorsements.  The fake celebrity endorsement scam is one of the most common you’ll find, but there are countless other examples to watch out for. Here are some more of the most widespread Bitcoin scams trying to take your money online: With over £190 billion in financial fraud every year in the UK, according to the National Crime Agency, everyone needs to do their part to protect themselves. Whenever you’re considering Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency investments, be sure to follow these simple precautions to prevent yourself from losing everything:"
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."

We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2022-09-16 14:36:22+00:00,Market Wrap: Expect More Blood Next Week,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-expect-more-blood-next-week/,"The week of the Merge was heavily anticipated by the entire crypto world. And on September 15, 2022, Ethereum became fully Proof of Stake. Initially, market speculators predicted Ethereum and the entire market would probably have a post-merge run. However, it was not to be.  Bitcoin ruined the party and crashed by about -5%, dragging the whole market down with it. Here is what to expect next week on Bitcoin price. Last week, Bitcoin was still trending below the $20k mark. Our verdict for this week was Bullish, mainly due to the Ethereum Merge. Bitcoin started the week well after September 9 and even pushed up a further 6.48% to reach $22,781. However, on Tue Sep 13, 2022, Bitcoin crashed below the $22k mark after the United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for August came in higher than expected. The 12.83% crash set BTC at $19,862. In just two days, Ethereum would Merge, and this piece of news would certainly push up Bitcoin’s price. Or would it? September 15 came, and Bitcoin slumped a further -2% from its September 13 low, setting it at $19,500. Traders had been successfully ‘Stop Hunted’ at athe $21.5k level. Bitcoin now faces hefty sell pressure as the market looks forward to a negative report from the FOMC meeting next week on September 21. $19,500 proved to be strong support as it previously supported BTC price for more than a week before giving in to pressure from the bears. On the other hand, Bitcoin is still displaying a common chart pattern breakout. From this angle, we can say the asset simply broke out and is currently on a retest before bouncing back up. A full retest could see Bitcoin re-visit the lower $18k range before bouncing back up. The bounce would also be epic as it would be nothing short of +25%. Targets to look out for in the coming week are $18590 to $19,000 and $17,987 on the lower side. If bulls put up a fight, then the target to watch out for is the $21,580 to $21,900 range.  Verdict Next Week: Bearish Verdict September: Bearish Stop Hunt – Stop hunting is a strategy that attempts to force some market participants out of their positions by driving the price of an asset to a level where many individuals have chosen to set stop-loss orders."
2022-09-09 09:52:11+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Break Out Confirmed!,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-break-out-confirmed/,"Bitcoin has had a fruitful week, but the price only recovered recently. On Sep. 5, Russia decided to go all in on Bitcoin by legalizing the asset for international trade. However, the price of the asset did not immediately react to this positive news – Russia is the largest nation in the world, after all. However, Bitcoin finally managed to break out of a month-long falling wedge. Here are the details. Last week’s analysis promised us a bullish week; however, Bitcoin did some erratic moves throughout the week. The falling wedge was almost complete, and BTC was due to make a decision.  However, the asset did not break to the upside early enough; instead, it fell sharply on two consecutive days and found support at $18707. Finally, the break to the upside happened on September 9, 2022, pushing BTC up +10.64% from its previous low. BTC has seen a nice bounce over the last 48 hours. Previously we had a bounce at the $19,670 level. However, the market lost this level, and now the bulls have to regain it if they want to reverse the trend. If this happens, the current bitcoin price action will post a giant bear trap with a significant upside. However, if we get a bearish retest of around $19,670, the market should continue to support around $17,946 – $17,633.   Bitcoin is now looking to test $21,594. Above this target, Bitcoin can hit $23,444, $24,490, $28,672, and finally $31,332. Verdict Next Week: Bullish Verdict September: Bearish"

A few days of green followed by several large red daily candles that wiped out all the gains made. Many traders have been liquidated, losing large sums of money. Yet, Bitcoin cares not.  In today’s analysis, Bitcoin seems to be trying to break out. The question is will it make it, or will it break under the vice grip of the bears? Let’s explore.  In last week’s analysis, the verdict was ‘Bearish’. Let us recap the bearish scenario of the past week.Bitcoin failed to rise to the 21-day EMA and fell down hard toward the predicted price of $18,910. However, the asset did not reach the expected support. Instead, it bounced off the $19,584 mark. When Bitcoin crossed below the 21-day SMA, it went into a falling wedge that we shall explore next. All eyes are now watching closely at what BTC will do. The asset is almost at the end of the falling wedge, a pattern with a 68% chance of breaking to the upside. If it breaks to the upside, we can expect to test the 21-day SMA, which is around $21,137. Beyond this, BTC should rise to around $23,800 – $24,488, where the next resistance appears. Even though most indicators show that next week will be a bullish week for BTC, some concerning fundamentals seem to point to the asset tanking in price. Tyler Swope of Blockchain Leaks Twitter account thinks September will be a bearish month for BTC, given the month has been historically the most bearish for this asset. The Federal is holding its September FOMC meeting on the 21st, and Tyler expects some bad news. While the markets expected the FOMC to slow down rate hikes, the chairman, Jerome Powell, had other things in mind. On August 26, 2022, he was recorded saying, “While the lower inflation readings for July are certainly welcome. A single month’s improvement falls far short of what the committee will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down. So we are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive, to return inflation to 2%. July’s increase in the target range was the second 75 basis point increase in his many meetings. And I said then that another unusually large increase couldn’t be appropriate in our next meeting…” – Jerome Powell – Chairman, FOMC Yikes! Verdict Next Week: Bullish Verdict September: Bearish"

2022-08-31 13:04:00+00:00,Why will Bitcoins not go away anytime soon?,https://blockzeit.com/why-will-bitcoins-not-go-away-anytime-soon/,"Bitcoin is the first ever cryptocurrency that came into existence in 2009. Since its inception, this digital currency has been getting popular and growing by leaps and bounds. Its price has constantly been soaring high until the last few months. During the last few months, the price of Bitcoin has dipped due to the economic impacts of the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war. Apart from Bitcoin, there are so many other cryptocurrencies available and you can add such digital assets to ypur portfolio to diversify your investment plan. Despite the latest price fall of Bitcoin, there is nothing to worry about for long-term Bitcoin investors, as the price will rise. It is just a matter of time. You can visit thebitcoincode.io to know more about this. There have been several moments of ups and down in Bitcoin’s price movements over the years. Even the recent price fall of the world’s most popular digital currency is temporary. Bitcoin will again soar high. Here are some ultimate reasons why Bitcoin is not going away anytime soon.  Despite the recent price fall of Bitcoin, this digital cryptocurrency is known to be beyond competition compared to other currencies. Due to its high volatility, the ups and downs in its price movements are not surprising. On top of that, being the most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin certainly has the most potential. Traders and investors always come around to putting their trust in Bitcoin for obvious reasons. Despite the availability of so many cryptocurrencies in the market, Bitcoin still has the trust of traders and investors. On the other hand, as per the market capital, Bitcoin is the number one digital currency out there. This is the fundamental motivation behind Bitcoin being beyond competition compared to others. In short, people are fascinated with Bitcoins. This is why so many people invest in Bitcoin these days.  In the world of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is the hot cake. People, traders and investors just love to play the game of Bitcoin price prediction. Some do it randomly or arbitrarily, while there are specialists that use tools and methods to give a systematic predicted value. The experts take it seriously to predict the future projected values of Bitcoin, directly and indirectly getting people to invest in this digital currency.  On the other hand, so many other aspects contribute to Bitcoin’s positive growth and development. For example, the Bitcoin creator is still a complete mystery to the world. People know him as Satoshi Nakamoto, but nobody has seen him personally. Some say Satoshi is not a single person but a group of hackers that created Bitcoin. At the same time, others theorize that it is a secret organization. All these news, rumors and aspects make people interested in Bitcoin. As a result, people tend to get involved with Bitcoin trading. This is certainly considered one of the best reasons Bitcoin, the biggest digital cryptocurrency, stays there. Despite its recent price dip, it is not going anywhere soon.  A fixed amount of Bitcoin can be minted, which is 21 million. But as compared to earlier times, more Bitcoins are getting minted presently. This has contributed to the growing availability of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency. Moreover, in its early times, Bitcoin ran into issues and problems that may have created doubt about the digital currency. For example, it was faced a double-spending problems at its initial stage. But, now such issues have been resolved.  As more people, traders, investors and miners are getting interested in Bitcoin, it is getting popular. As a result, it is becoming a more trustworthy cryptocurrency option out there. Not to mention, more numbers of miners are coming into the picture to mine more Bitcoin. All these aspects ensure that Bitcoin is there to stay.  Conclusion So it can be said from the above discussion that Bitcoin still holds its position strong in the market despite its recent price drop. As this is a fundamentally strong cryptocurrency, it will surely grow in the coming time. As the price has fallen, more people and traders have started to invest in Bitcoin for obvious reasons. The prospect for Bitcoin traders and investors is certainly great. One needs to have patience during this turbulent time."
2022-08-26 09:52:06+00:00,Market Wrap: Will Bitcoin (BTC) Defy All the Doom Sayers and Rise?,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-will-bitcoin-btc-defy-all-the-doom-sayers-and-rise/,"Bitcoin (BTC) made a textbook move last week and broke out downward from the rising wedge it had been in for exactly 3 months. After the breakout, Bitcoin fell by -12.94% in three consecutive days. Rising wedges have a higher chance of breaking downwards; hence, this move did not surprise many traders. Curious to know how Bitcoin will perform next week? Read on to find out. Bitcoin broke down from the rising wedge and consequently broke below the 21-day moving average. The analysis showed that Bitcoin would continue going down because of the intensive market sell pressure, and there were two main targets: $21,729 and $18,910. BTC managed to break below the $21,500 support, but surprisingly and pretty weak support at $20,900 held its own.Bitcoin is currently trading at $21,516. Now that the last analysis came true, where is Bitcoin going next? BTC has been trending below the 21-day moving average since August 18, two days after the breakout. The asset is also below the 200-day EMA Bitcoin is currently trying to retest the 21-day EMA. If BTC breaks out, it will have to tackle another relatively formidable local resistance at $23,800 before retesting the falling wedge’s bottom trend line. Additionally, the 200-day moving average has been inching closer to price action. It seems the indicator grew tired of waiting for price action to reach up to it and decided to meet Bitcoin halfway. If BTC bulls persist, the price action will meet the 200-day moving average (projected in blue) at around $27,736. If BTC breaks above this indicator, folks, we are back in bull season.  BTC will be continuing its descent ever so gracefully into the sub-20k region. If the 21-day moving average retest is rejected, Bitcoin will spiral down to the next reasonable support of $18,910. While some traders might have been surprised by the Bitcoin move, it certainly did not surprise our readers since we had already covered this potential scenario the week before it happened.  Bitcoin price is heavily manipulated by whales, hedge funds, centralized exchanges and VCs. And therefore, the analyses we do here can break down under such external influences. This is why fundamental analysis is important. Knowing what is happening in the market throughout the week plays a big role in determining where to put more weight; bullish or bearish scenario. The bearish scenario is much stronger and has more indicators going on for it than the bullish scenario. Since this is a game of chance, bears have a higher chance of prevailing in the coming week than bulls. NOTE: This is not financial advice, but it can be helpful when you’re doing your due diligence."
2022-08-24 07:08:34+00:00,Bitcoin vs Ethereum: Which is the Better Investment?,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-vs-ethereum-which-is-the-better-investment/,"Bitcoin’s long reign as the apex cryptocurrency to keep in your portfolio could be coming to an end. Which begs the question, what would you invest in if you could only have one cryptocurrency in your portfolio? For good reason, most people would probably say Bitcoin (BTC 2.29%). Bitcoin is not only the most well-known and popular cryptocurrency, but it is also frequently used as the standard against which all other cryptocurrencies are measured. Bitcoin has always outperformed its competitors in terms of market capitalization. So, is it possible that Ethereum (ETH 6.30%) is a better long-term investment than Bitcoin? For years, Ethereum has been a distant second to Bitcoin. However, there are several key reasons why Ethereum may now be a better long-term investment.  Most importantly, the technological platform that underpins Ethereum is about to undergo a significant upgrade. If there is only one reason to reconsider your Ethereum investment thesis, it has to be the Merge. This is the long-awaited transition of the Ethereum blockchain from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.  In layman’s terms, this means that Ethereum will soon be running on superior technology, allowing everything on the Ethereum blockchain to be done faster, cheaper, and better. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is still mired in its energy-intensive, low-throughput proof-of-work mining technology. According to some, the July crypto rally was fueled by optimism about the upcoming Merge, and with reason. This leads us to the second reason why Ethereum is a better long-term investment than Bitcoin. Simply put, Ethereum has more real-world utility than Bitcoin. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), smart contracts, and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols have all been created by developers and run on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum has an entire ecosystem surrounding it that Bitcoin does not have. While Bitcoin has more social media avatars attempting to push it higher, Ethereum has more developers, entrepreneurs, and IT professionals bringing real-world applications to life. You can use Bitcoin to pay for transactions or keep it as a long-term store of value in the hope that its value will rise due to digital scarcity. However, Bitcoin is much more limited than Ethereum due to its underlying technological infrastructure. That brings us to the final reason Ethereum is a better long-term play than Bitcoin: the entire investment narrative surrounding Bitcoin is crumbling. Until the market crash this year, the main reason for holding Bitcoin for the long term was that it was uncorrelated to traditional investments like stocks. In other words, even if the stock market as a whole tanked, Bitcoin would not. It would function similarly to “digital gold” in this regard. When everything else was melting down, it would have intrinsic value. As more investors began to regard Bitcoin as “digital gold,” it was natural for people to want to hold BTC during a crisis or downturn. But what happened in the most recent market downturn? Bitcoin fell just like every other cryptocurrency, albeit harder and faster in some cases. As a result, some of the allure of Bitcoin as “digital gold” is fading. At the same time, the Merge’s shift to a proof-of-stake mechanism will turn ETH into a deflationary asset, increasing its appeal as a potential inflationary hedge. Furthermore, because of how staking works, an increasing amount of ETH will be “locked up” and unavailable for trading. The price of ETH will naturally rise as a result, owing to the simple law of supply and demand. As if that weren’t enough, an increasing number of high-profile companies worldwide are building on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Simply put, Ethereum is quickly becoming the blockchain of choice for large institutions due to its flexibility and scalability. Ethereum is “digital oil” if Bitcoin is “digital gold.” Ethereum will be the more valuable cryptocurrency in the long run because it has more practical applications. There is no doubt as to Ethereum’s utility and adoption but as the September merge approaches those not already invested in Ethereum should be prepared for a “buy the rumor, sell the news” situation as most of the recent increase in the price of Ethereum is due in great part to the enthusiasm surrounding the Merge. As with any investment, do your own research and never invest more than you can afford to lose."
2022-08-19 13:28:19+00:00,Market Wrap: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Retraces and Breaks Below $22k,https://blockzeit.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-btc-price-retraces-and-breaks-below-22k/,"Bitcoin did it! The asset fully filled down to $21.2k on the wick and crypto Twitter was lit with speculators calling sub $10k prices while others hoping BTC will consolidate at the $21K – $22K range.  We have been following Bitcoin’s price with our own analyses which have been on point for most of the journey. Let’s dive in and see what’s in store for Bitcoin this coming week. As of Friday, August 12, 2022, BTC was trading at $24,014. However, the asset was in a rising wedge. Rising wedges have a 68% chance of wreaking to the downside, and hence, Bitcoin was looking at a high likelihood of crashing. If it did, the price target would be $17,367. As of Friday, August 19 09:47 UTC 2022, Bitcoin was trading at $21,695 – a clean break from the rising wedge.  The 3-day -10% drop in the price of Bitcoin put it below the 21-day EMA. The asset is now moving further away from the 200-day moving average. If the bears should persist, then Bitcoin will hit $18,910 by the end of next week. Beyond this, the other support regions are $17,367 and finally the $12-$14k region. Kaleo, a Crypto Options trader on Twitter with over 500,000 followers, thinks Bitcoin is going to consolidate around the $21k – $22k region before bouncing to higher highs.  “Bitcoin / $BTC. Finally got the break beneath $23K. Waiting for a fill in the $21K – $22K range before expecting a bounce.”– @CryptoKaleo – There have been rumors that a black swan event is coming with the unlock of Mt. Gox Bitcoins in which 137,000 BTC may go to creditors of the Mt. Gox exchange in 2013. It is anticipated that the unlock will happen in the next 12 days from August 18, 2022. This unlock may have more catastrophic effects on the markets compared to Elon’s and Do Kwon’s dump, which combined, caused the market to crash from $40k to below $20k."
2022-08-15 06:08:34+00:00,What is the Lightning Network?,https://blockzeit.com/what-is-the-lightning-network/,"The Lightning Network enables users to send and receive Bitcoin quickly and cheaply by moving transactions off the main blockchain — think of it as a fastlane for Bitcoin. Bitcoin has risen from obscurity to a half a trillion dollar market cap in 13 years, settling over $60 trillion in total transfer volume along the way.  In the early days of bitcoin it was often given away as a joke or infamously to buy pizza.  At the time the two pizzas ordered cost 10,000 bitcoin, worth about $40. Today, those pizzas would be worth $384 million as bitcoin has risen to be the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world. Despite this rise and widespread adoption, Bitcoin’s decentralized design restricts it to only 7 transactions per second. When the number of transactions on the network exceeds 7, users face long wait times and fees of up to $60 per transaction. Even with recent fees ranging from $1 to $2, the network remains unsuitable for purchasing the proverbial cup of coffee. Enter the Lightning Network, a layer-2 protocol built on top of Bitcoin that has the potential to scale to millions of instant transactions per second for pennies.  If the Lightning Network gains traction, it may be able to undercut the fees of industry behemoths Visa and Mastercard, as well as the entire global remittance market. This would benefit merchants and consumers. Lightning, like most layer-2 solutions, aims to increase transaction throughput and lower costs while maintaining adequate decentralization by moving activity to a second network. Once BTC is on the Lightning network, it can be transacted instantly and for pennies. Users deposit BTC into the Lightning Network and then transact cheaply through payment channels, rather than sending each transaction over the Bitcoin blockchain. The more people and businesses that join, as with most networks, the more useful it becomes. With 1 cent fees, Lightning transactions are clearly less expensive than using the Bitcoin network. However, what is more intriguing is that Lightning has the potential to replace existing payment processors for fiat transactions without the consumer being aware that BTC was used as the underlying settlement layer.  The Lightning Network is a decentralized system that skirts the main Bitcoin blockchain, allowing you to conduct ultra-fast transactions that don’t require node acknowledgement or block confirmations. The network consists of nodes that run on personal computers, meaning that you won’t need to spend much money to transfer bitcoins.  One of the main disadvantages of the Lightning Network is that it requires users to have a wallet compatible with it. Without this wallet, you’ll be forced to use a traditional Bitcoin wallet, which can take time. Despite this, some wallets will manage on-chain payments without fees, which can be a pain. The convenience factor is likely to improve over time. However, if you’re still not convinced, you can opt for a different service. The primary problem with a bitcoin-based Lightning Network is that the payment channels tend to bring about centralization, which runs counter to the peer-to-peer nature of the bitcoin system. In contrast, supporters of Lightning Network claim that it is a good way to implement on-chain transactions. Despite Satoshi’s vision for a decentralized payment network, problems persist.  First of all, a Bitcoin can only process 7 transactions per second. This is impossible to scale. Second, Lightning Network is not widely used, so a single payment can only be completed once. Another problem with Lightning Network is the low number of channel hops between users. If this problem continues, the entire network would become centralized. While Lightning Network was designed to solve this problem, it’s still not perfect. The world’s dominant payment processing networks are Visa and Mastercard. They made $24 billion in 2021 by collecting 2-3% transaction fees every time someone swiped a debit or credit card. Payment processors using the Lightning Network may be able to undercut that. Assume you need to make a $100 payment to a merchant. Using your credit card costs the merchant $3, which is then passed on to you in the form of hidden fees.  What if you converted $100 USD into BTC, transferred it for pennies on the Lightning network, and then converted the BTC back to $100 USD? For a 1% fee, a service called OpenNode can use the Lightning Network to do just that.  Similar logic can be applied to the $40 billion global remittance fee market, where the average cross-border transaction fee is 6.4%. Regardless of how cost-effective it is to replace Visa/Mastercard and international remittance companies with Lightning, it is easier said than done. The incumbents benefit from large network effects, and Lightning, like any new venture, faces a cold start problem. Where there is the potential to disrupt incumbents, current Lightning adoption is still small (but growing!). According to Arcane Research, Lightning facilitated $20-30M in monthly payments in Q1 22. That’s a fourfold increase year on year, but it’s a far cry from the $866B Visa facilitates each month. The main metric for measuring Lightning growth is “public node capacity,” which is essentially how much BTC is locked in public Lightning channels. Because an estimated 30% of channels are private, determining the network’s true value is difficult. However, we can see that public capacity is increasing. When measured in USD, the network has taken a predictable hit as the price of Bitcoin has fallen. However, the total number of Bitcoins in the network is reaching new all-time highs of over 4,500 BTC (approximately $100M). More importantly, as adoption grows, so does the ecosystem that surrounds Lightning. Bitcoin is supported by the Lightning protocol. Core infrastructure is located on top of Lighting. A growing number of payment and financial services, as well as consumer applications, are built on top of the core infrastructure. Lightning implementations, as well as node and liquidity services, comprise the core infrastructure. Lightning implementations are software programs that individuals and businesses can use to connect to the Lightning network, with Lightning Labs’ LND accounting for 70% of the market (as of 2020). Node and liquidity services host hardware, provide user interfaces, and aid in the management of Lightning payment channels (running your own node is complex). A variety of payment and financial services, as well as consumer apps, are built on top of the core infrastructure. Strike, for example, is based on an LND implementation that allows users to buy and sell BTC, tip creators on Twitter, and accept BTC from Shopify merchants. A growing number of emerging consumer use cases are also built on core infrastructure. Mash, for example, aims to disrupt the creator subscription model through streaming micropayments — think of it as paying your favorite Twitch streamers a couple cents per minute you watch instead of buying a one-size-fits-all subscription. Lightning is used by Zebedee to enable in-game economies that reward players with small amounts of Bitcoin. Users’ access to the network has grown in lockstep with the Lightning ecosystem. Access has increased from 10 million to 80 million users as a result of Cash App’s Lightning integration and El Salvador’s rollout of the Chivo wallet (the success of El Salvador’s rollout has been mixed, with research indicating that only 5% of sales in the country use BTC). Lightning is also supported by 26 exchanges, the most prominent of which are Kraken, Bitfinex, and Bitstamp. Robinhood recently announced an integration for its 20 million+ users, and P2P marketplace Paxful supports its 7 million+ users.  Users of these exchanges can deposit and withdraw bitcoin instantly and cheaply to and from any Lightning wallet, increasing the speed and lowering the cost compared to a typical BTC transaction. Funding is also increasing, with OpenNode raising a Series A at a valuation of $220 million and Lightning Labs raising $70 million for its Series B. Notably, former Meta’s crypto initiative head David Marcus’s Lightspark raised an undisclosed Series A to build Lightning infrastructure for businesses, developers, and merchants. The potential, funding, and momentum are all present, but significant obstacles remain. The main reasons for this are a lack of developer tooling, a high demand for payment use cases, technical obstacles, onboarding difficulties, and compliance and regulatory issues. More developer tooling is still required to enable more user-friendly applications. With most people still viewing Bitcoin as an investment, we have yet to see widespread demand for it to be used for payments (use of Lightning rails for fiat payments remains a compelling opportunity).  Despite integration efforts, Lightning remains difficult for new users and merchants. Furthermore, onboarding low-income users in developing countries remains a significant challenge to delivering on the promise of Lightning remittances. Finally, the absence of compliance and regulatory frameworks limits existing payment and banking service providers’ ability to onboard and serve a global customer base. Lightning, which debuted in 2018, is still in its early stages. With only about $100 million invested, it pales in comparison to Ethereum’s billion-dollar layer-2 networks, Arbitrum and Optimism. When compared to the more speculative activity driving much of the growth on smart contract platforms, lightning payment activity is more indicative of real-world utility. Despite its humble beginnings, the potential to convert crypto’s most valuable asset into a true medium of exchange has the potential to expand financial inclusion to anyone with a smartphone. The ability to route fiat transactions over Lightning rails at a low cost without users realizing they’re using Bitcoin has the potential to disrupt $150 billion* per year industries. Lightning could be for crypto what Visa and MasterCard are for fiat currencies. The combination of a globally accessible payment network and the world’s first open-source money protocol can aid Bitcoin’s evolution into a true global reserve currency. If this occurs, developing countries with high inflation and more smartphones than bank accounts are likely to lead the way. Despite some issues, it’s difficult not to be encouraged by the Lightning Network’s recent growth — particularly in the last six months. It’s worth noting that this growth is occurring during a bear market, when Bitcoin fees are low. In the event of a future bull market, we may see an increase in Lightning activity as fees on the base chain rise, sending users looking for cheaper ways to transact. If the Lightning Network continues to grow, it will have a significant impact on the future utility and value of Bitcoin, world’s oldest and most valuable digital asset."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2022-08-14 11:15:31+00:00,Tesla Sold 75% of its Bitcoin: What Does this Mean for Crypto?,https://blockzeit.com/tesla-sold-75-of-its-bitcoin-what-does-this-mean-for-crypto/,"Tesla revealed in February 2021 that the electric vehicle manufacturer had quietly amassed $1.5 billion in bitcoin. This resulted in a surge in demand for bitcoin in 2021, driving up the price. Elon personally purchased Bitcoin and Dogecoin and took to social media to announce his purchases. This sparked a Doge frenzy, with the memecoin reaching nearly $1 per DOGE. In July of this year, Tesla announced that it had sold 75% of its Bitcoin holdings in the midst of a market decline. Given the cryptocurrency’s declining value, Tesla stated that the company had exchanged its Bitcoin for traditional currency. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, has long been a supporter of Bitcoin, but it’s clear that the company’s finances still come first. Musk also stated last year that, despite having Bitcoin reserves, Tesla would not accept bitcoin as payment for Tesla vehicles due to environmental concerns. The drop follows Musk’s endorsements of the currency. Musk stated last year that the company would not sell its Bitcoin, but they have now done so. Musk’s words, as one of the world’s wealthiest people, have the power to shift markets.  Tesla’s Bitcoin selloff, on the other hand, may serve as a reminder that his promises are not always guaranteed, especially if they come from his Twitter account. As previously stated, Musk’s support for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin has had an impact on their respective markets in the past. When Musk speaks (or Tweets) markets move. However, Tesla’s Bitcoin selloff appears to have had little impact on the price of Bitcoin, which was already falling earlier this year. Part of the reason this had little impact on prices was that Tesla sold off their Bitcoin before making the announcement. It influenced market sentiment, but a $1.5 billion Bitcoin selloff is not on the horizon. Given Musk’s previous support for cryptocurrency, the company is not completely opposed to Bitcoin. The company has stated that it is willing to acquire more Bitcoin in the future. However, as a publicly traded company, shareholder value must be prioritized, and they cited Bitcoin as a loss for the company’s earnings. While Musk and Tesla have historically had an impact on cryptocurrency markets, this selloff does not appear to be the sole cause of Bitcoin’s price drop. Aside from Tesla’s selloff, the entire cryptocurrency market is in turmoil due to a variety of other factors. Inflation, a decline in all markets worldwide, and a number of cryptocurrency platforms, companies, and DAOs facing insolvency and regulatory pressure are among these factors. During a conference call, Musk stated that the move “should not be interpreted as a verdict on Bitcoin.” In the same call, Musk explained that the Bitcoin selloff was caused by liquidity concerns the company was experiencing as a result of the COVID lockdown in China, where Tesla has a plant in Shanghai.  Tesla was aware of the risk they were taking by holding Bitcoin during a market decline, and they could not guarantee that the losses would be offset by their production facilities in Shanghai. So, fearing more Chinese lockdowns, Tesla sold off the majority of its Bitcoin holdings. During the conference call, Musk also stated that Bitcoin is a “sideshow to the sideshow.” His primary concern at Tesla is to “accelerate the advent of stable energy,” and Bitcoin and cryptocurrency were viewed as a distraction from that goal.  Having said that, Musk is likely to keep his options open for purchasing more Bitcoin in the future, as they still kept 25% of their holdings in reserve. Tesla may continue to accumulate Bitcoin incrementally in the future, but not in the billions of dollars. Tesla is not alone in making such selloffs. With global markets falling and talk of a recession looming (although not so much lately), risky tech stocks and volatile cryptocurrencies appear less appealing in the face of a potentially five-quarter-long recession, according to the Bank of England. Tesla’s purchase of Bitcoin reserves in 2021 may not have met some investor expectations, but it added legitimacy to the idea of a company purchasing reputable cryptocurrencies. Musk’s currency selloff was primarily a cash move for liquidity in the face of Shanghai lockdowns due to the covid pandemic. Bitcoin may be down, but it is far from dead. The author holds both Bitcoin as well as Tesla stock and this article is presented for educational purposes only. "
2022-08-12 08:50:56+00:00,Bitcoin Price: Are We Out of the Woods Yet?,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-are-we-out-of-the-woods-yet/,"This week has been as eventful, if not more than other weeks. On one hand, Tornado Cash got banned in the states after allegedly laundering over $7 billion since its inception, while on the other, Nepal and Australia are joining the race for CBDC adoption. Bitcoin is waiting for the right catalyst to either push it up or down. Let’s look at the most likely scenario. Last week on Bitcoin price analysis, the asset was dangerously close to breaking down from the rising wedge. All that it needed was a nudge from the right (or wrong) kind of news. But alas! The news of Babel Finance’s massive $280 million loss did little to deter the king of crypto. The consequence is that BTC rose throughout the week to touch a high of $24,921.   While this is most unexpected, Bitcoin is eventually fated to drop down out of the rising wedge. This is how most (68%) of rising wedges play out. However, before then Bitcoin can have a mini run over the next four weeks before crashing down to $17,367.  Bitcoin is still trending above the 21-day moving average, a good sign for most buyers, but it is dangerously close and can shift below this moving average anytime. The target for the four week mini-run is $28,677, which is +19.66% from the current price of $24,014. Bitcoin just delayed the inevitable, even though a 32% chance of not crashing still exists. The bullish and bearish scenarios for Bitcoin for the coming weeks seems rather less volatile. Traders can make some good profit by cornering the incoming mini pump, and shorting BTC when it reaches the $28k region. However, it good to note that fundamentals (news) can break this analysis at any time and hence, it is advisabe to keep your ears and eyes open.

2022-08-05 05:32:03+00:00,Bitcoin Price: Will Bitcoin Break Under the Pressure,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-will-bitcoin-break-under-the-pressure/,"Although the markets ended last week with a nice Bitcoin pump to $24k, the asset cooled off over the weekend and is currently sitting at $23,107. Many analysts and traders still call the pump ‘fake’ and expect Bitcoin to go down lower. Will it, though? Let’s find out. Last week Bitcoin was trending at around the $24000 range. The bearish scenario was a double bottom pattern that was forming; if it had prevailed, BTC would have dropped around $18,165 this week. The bullish scenario was a +32% run-up to around the 200-day EMA. This would put BTC at around $32,382. However, Bitcoin did neither of these scenarios. Instead, it remained in a tight coil, playing between $22,500 and $24,000. In doing so, BTC is forming some very interesting patterns. Let’s see what next week holds The number of hacks in the DeFi space this week has been alarming, but BTC has resisted the urge to crash. The asset is currently trending above the 21-day moving average, bouncing off of it on August 5, 2022.  Bitcoin is also in a rising wedge, which has a 68% chance of breaking to the downside. If it does, BTC will look at a (rather weak) support at $17,367. After this $17k support, it will be more of a free fall for BTC until $12,600.  However, if Bitcoin takes that small chance and breaks up from this pattern, BTC could first hit $28,701 (local resistance) before attempting a strike at the 200-day EMA at around $32,382.  At this point, for Bitcoin to make any significant movements, either up or down, there has to be a catalyst (upside) or a domino (downside). Crypto analyst Tyler Swope seems to think it will be more of dominoes falling than bullish catalysts in the coming days and weeks. Babel Finance has been o the crypto Twitter radar for allegedly losing over $280 million using customer funds to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even though this seems like an isolated event, it is not. Babel finance also lost over 8,000 BTC and 56,000 ETH belonging to clients in June. This loss had them halting withdrawals from their platform.  This is not all. Babel finance is also a crypto lender to Bitcoin miners; therefore, they take miners’ BTC as collateral and, in return, give them loans. As of January 2021, the company accepted Bitcoin mining machines as collateral for handing out loans. The firm mainly operates in China, the largest Bitcoin mining nation. If Babel finance blows up, it ushers in miner capitulation (the act of Bitcoin miners selling off their mined Bitcoin on exchanges (possibly at a loss), which can cause the Bitcoin price to crash.

2022-08-04 12:21:21+00:00,MicroStrategy CEO and Bitcoin Maximalist Michael Saylor Steps Down,https://blockzeit.com/microstrategy-ceo-and-bitcoin-evangelist-michael-saylor-steps-down/,"MicroStrategy CEO and Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor is stepping down. In this article we’ll look at whether the loss is related to declining Bitcoin prices or Saylor’s expertise in the space. We’ll also examine the company’s current position in the market. MicroStrategy has named a new CEO. Michael Saylor, who has served as the company’s CEO since 1989, will transition to the role of executive chairman on August 8. In his new role, he will be responsible for overseeing all aspects of the company’s business operations and its Bitcoin holdings. According to Saylor, the decision to split his role will give him more time to focus on these investments and its growing Bitcoin treasury. While Saylor was the company’s CEO for nearly three decades, his recent hyperfocus on Bitcoin has taken its toll on the company’s balance sheet. The company has incurred a $917.8 million loss on the digital asset, largely because of the collapse in its price since its all-time high in November last year. Despite this, MicroStrategy’s stock price is up 16% at the time of writing, while Bitcoin is up more than 3% on major cryptocurrency exchanges. Michael Saylor will be stepping down as CEO of MicroStrategy on August 8. Moving forward Saylor will serve as executive chairman of the company and focus on its acquisition strategy, including bitcoin. Michael Saylor founded MicroStrategy in 1989 and took it public in 1998. Phong Le will take over as CEO on Aug. 8. Mr. Le has served as MicroStrategy’s President since July 2020. He has a background in finance and telecommunications, including a stint as a VP of strategy and business operations at NII Holdings. He worked in a consulting practice at Deloitte from 1998 to 2010. Le says he doesn’t expect any major strategic changes at MicroStrategy. He has been aligned with Saylor on Bitcoin strategy and enterprise strategy, and he’s particularly pleased with the way the company’s CFO Andrew Kang has handled the financial division. However, he does anticipate a number of changes. Saylor will focus on the company’s innovation and corporate strategy while Le will run its bitcoin strategy. The impact of declining Bitcoin prices on a company’s bottom line can vary dramatically. For example, when Bitcoin prices plummeted by 70 per cent in June, Celsius stopped accepting customer deposits and transfers, causing them to remain frozen since then. On July 13, Celsius filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It’s not the only crypto company to suffer from the downturn. Three Arrows Capital, a Singapore-based crypto hedge fund, was forced to liquidate in June 2022.  The price of Bitcoin is a bellwether for the whole cryptocurrency market and has a tendency to trigger other sell-offs. As more investors lose confidence in digital currencies, the prices of cryptocurrencies decline as well. In December, the price of Ethereum fell below the $1,000 mark, its lowest level since January 2021. The price has since dropped steadily. It is now worth less than half of its previous value. MicroStrategy’s new CEO will continue to focus on its bitcoin acquisition strategy and advocacy initiatives. As of June 30, MicroStrategy had raised $2.4 billion in debt and held 129,699 bitcoins. However, the company recorded impairment losses of $1.98 billion on the bitcoins it holds. However, this is unlikely to impact the company’s position in the market, according to BTIG analyst Mark Palmer."
2022-08-03 13:02:57+00:00,What are the Benefits of DeFi for Bitcoin?,https://blockzeit.com/what-are-the-benefits-of-defi-for-bitcoin/,"There are several different ways to exchange cryptocurrencies. Some of the most common methods are through a decentralized exchange aggregator, while others rely on an open-source community. For those unfamiliar with the term, DeFi is a blockchain-based financial system that utilizes a trustless swap. Regardless of the method you choose, you’ll likely benefit from a Bitcoin DeFi wallet. To learn more, read on. A decentralized exchange aggregator can serve as a great way to invest in cryptocurrency. Although they have their own protocol and mechanism, decentralized exchanges have many advantages over centralized exchanges: Fast fact: The first DEX appeared on the scene in 2014. The rise of decentralized financial services on the blockchain and its potential to improve liquidity made the exchanges more popular and sparked further growth. However, DEXs often face issues due to lack of liquidity, but the advent of AMM technology has changed that. Uniswap’s automated market maker acts as a liquidity provider and pools assets from crypto holders. The value of the assets in the pool should be equal in each trading pair, and the value of the liquid assets is determined by supply of liquidity. The adoption of blockchain by banks has largely positive effects on their business. For instance, many banks have positive aims and objectives, such as being early pioneers in the market and acquiring sufficient market share. Additionally, a blockchain-based financial system can help them introduce dynamic changes into their organizations and attract more attention from shareholders. As blockchain technology has gained popularity in recent years, more financial services companies are extending their offerings and scaling up their business. In response, new teams are emerging with more business opportunities and clients to attract. While advocates of DeFi and Web3 believe that their systems are better than the current system, the real question is: how do they get there? There is no single answer to the question, but blockchain-based financial systems can be a great way to automate transactions. These systems will help businesses automate contracts-related calculations and save time and labor. Furthermore, the technology can help enterprises solve inefficiencies and address operational risks, including fraud. One of the most attractive advantages of blockchain-based financial systems is the increased speed of transaction settlement. With blockchain technology, financial companies can now settle transactions in milliseconds with minimal fees, saving them a significant amount of money on international transactions.  In addition, blockchains can help financial institutions record transactions and report to regulatory agencies. These features can make many financial services more efficient. For example, faster transaction settlements will improve various financial services. Moreover, banks can use blockchain to resolve issues like identity-verification and documentation, which are common problems for traditional financial institutions. Because banks have access to more personal information than other organizations, they are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the blockchain. This new technology may fundamentally change finance and the FinTech industry. But before that happens, more research is needed to determine whether Blockchain-based financial systems are indeed a viable solution. This article provides a brief introduction to the technology behind these technologies. Last month, developers from the Stacks community deployed working Bitcoin swaps. These exchanges provide unique visibility into the state of Bitcoin and trigger actions in Stacks-based smart contracts. At the time, these swaps are called “Catamaran swaps.” Despite their names, these exchanges represent an entire world of potential for Bitcoin DeFi applications. As the name suggests, a trustless bitcoin swap does not rely on a third party to facilitate the exchange of cryptocurrencies. Trustswap is the next evolution of Decentralized Finance transactions. It solves subscription problems, split payments, and cross-chain token swaps by wrapping any token into ERC20.  This service allows investors and consumers to seamlessly split payments and accept annual subscriptions. It is essential for the investment space, which is why the company conducted an Initial Liquid Offering (ILO) in June 2020. To learn more about this revolutionary new service, check out the Trust Swap website and podcast. Another blockchain-based exchange that eliminates the need for a trusted third party is Chainflip. This permission-less cryptocurrency exchange offers direct cross-chain crypto swaps. It is compatible with Ethereum, bypassing the limitations of the blockchain. Its seamless platform also allows users to swap ETH for BTC directly and XTZ for DOT. Moreover, this service eliminates the need for wrappers and heavy trade-offs. Chainflip’s design and construction prioritize security. Their vaults are secure, as they do not require an intermediary. Furthermore, Chainflip has optimized the vault management process. Unlike centralized exchanges, trustless bitcoin swaps eliminate the need for a third party. Instead, users can exchange any other type of currency with complete anonymity. And most importantly, this service is free of third-party fees. It’s a great option for individuals who want to avoid high fees, but who do not want to trust a third party. The open-source community for Bitcoin DeFi is growing, and its growth is driven by the growing number of investors who are putting money in this new currency. But it is also a risk. The financial institutions that are relying on DeFi to make money are not likely to let it go, given their main interest in keeping control of how people access their money. As such, regulators are wary of it growing too large to pose a systemic risk. DeFi is the open financial ecosystem that uses smart contracts and cryptocurrencies to replace traditional financial institutions. Traditional financial systems require intermediaries who must act fairly to facilitate a transaction and be trusted. By replacing those intermediaries with software, DeFi removes this step, giving users direct access to a global financial market. The software that is used to process transactions is known as a smart contract, and once live, it cannot be changed. This means transactions will be fair and trustworthy. Open-source communities for Bitcoin DeFi are a crucial component of the growing bitcoin ecosystem. They’re making the decentralized exchanges more accessible to the public. It’s not just about decentralizing exchanges but also about making it easier for investors to access a range of financial services. Because they are decentralized and run without centralized authorities, the system eliminates human error and helps people make the right decisions when using it. The DeFi protocol is becoming the leading decentralized crypto trading protocol. As a result, there is an expanding network of DeFi Apps. Traders, liquidity providers, and developers all participate in the decentralized financial system. These applications allow the use of ETH and other crypto assets. They don’t need centralized approval, and they don’t require a third party to approve trades.  This decentralized financial system entails locking Bitcoin into smart contracts, allowing you to invest in the asset seamlessly.  By using Ethereum-based tokens to back this currency, you can avoid the risk of losing your entire investment. And since this new type of investment is completely secure, it’s worth a try if you’re interested in reducing your overall risk. The Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem is a growing market for investors, and the growth of this cryptocurrency has increased the number of platforms available for converting Bitcoin to Ethereum. DeFi platforms offer a wide range of benefits, including the ability to easily liquidate and reinvest your earnings. The security and long-term viability of the platforms themselves will determine their success. There are several factors that need to be considered before implementing a Bitcoin DeFi system. Firstly, the DeFi ecosystem is a collection of various entities. These include exchanges, lending platforms, and many other entities. DeFi allows users to access their funds through a secure digital wallet. This means that the entire process of making a transaction is fast and convenient. Also, there are no middlemen to deal with, which can reduce transaction times and costs. The system also allows for passive income from yield farming. To learn more about yield farming check out our quick guide here. Although the emergence of Bitcoin DeFi projects has been a recent development, the concept has already been in use on other blockchains, such as Ethereum. Other blockchains are also developing DeFi products and services. If successful, the DeFi ecosystems will synergistically interact with each other and expand the market for cryptocurrencies. When implemented correctly, it will lead to mass adoption of cryptocurrency and cryptocurrencies, and this is just the beginning. DeFi has the potential to revolutionize an antiquated, inefficient and unfair financial system but it is not without risks. Do your own research before buying or staking any cryptocurrency."
2022-07-29 10:07:24+00:00,Bitcoin Price: BTC Rises to $24k as The Fed Hikes Interest Rates,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-btc-rises-to-24k-as-the-fed-hikes-interest-rates/,"It was a week full of uncertainty for both crypto and traditional markets as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) prepared to announce the new interest rates earlier this week. In addition, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) was also set to announce Q2 data on the national GDP. Both reports came out less than satisfactory, but did BTC flinch? Let’s find out in this week’s analysis of Bitcoin price. Last week Bitcoin showed signs of trending up after it broke out of this downtrend. However, the typical retest had not happened yet, and it was what we were waiting for this week. If the retest was going to be affected by these two pieces of news, then BTC would tumble down to the $13k mark.  The bullish scenario for BTC last week would have it touch $25,745. However, Bitcoin has somewhat been consolidating between a local low of $21k and a local high of $24k. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised the interest rates for the second time in a row by 75 basis points (or 0.75 percentage points), bringing the benchmark rate to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%.  On Thursday, the National Bureau of Economic Research released its Q2 GDP data, which revealed that the United States economy had contracted two quarters in a row. In Q1, the GDP fell by -1.6%, and in Q2, it fell by a further -0.9%. Bitcoin’s bearish case is weak, at least for now. After last week’s mini-pump that sent the asset to about $25k, the price action cooled off but still remained above the 21-day EMA (Green line). BTC used this moving average as its local support and bounced off it.  While this is good, many have called this Bitcoin run a bull trap. The current forming pattern might quickly evolve into a double top and send Bitcoin crashing all the way to $18,165. From $18,165, it is a free fall to $12,060. While this bearish scenario is far-fetched, it could still happen. So best be alert. Twitter is flush with calls of “bull season is back.” All the signs (or at least most of them) indicate that the market is turning from red to green. BTC is trending above the 21-day moving average for the first time in about 3 months. If Bitcoin bulls manage to take control of the market, BTC is looking at a +32% run up to $31,945, where it meets the 200-day EMA. This has been known to be a strong resistance/support indicator, and if BTC breaks above it, we will witness prices above the $40k mark. The two most likely short-term bullish targets for Bitcoin are $28,477 and $32k."
2022-07-22 11:20:09+00:00,Is This Bitcoin Run Legitimate or Is it a Bull Trap?,https://blockzeit.com/is-this-bitcoin-run-legitimate-or-is-it-a-bull-trap/,"Many, including JP Morgan chase bank, say that Bitcoindemand is growing as intense deleveraging is mostly over. But is it? Let’s look at the Bitcoin price this week. The Bitcoin price was looking bullish most of this week, running up from below $20k to up around $24,280. In last week’s analysis, Bitcoin was showing signs of moving downwards. The bearish pennant was barely holding up and an imminent crash was on the horizon. However, Bitcoin made a complete reversal and pumped to around $24,280. This pump has had many traders and crypto enthusiasts hopeful about the end of the bear market. But is the pump to be trusted? Bitcoin broke out of the ascending triangle on the Daily chart, and shot for $25,745. However, the highest it was able to reach was $24,280. At current price, BTC is till -11% away from the target price after a typical ascending triangle break out. Moreover, the asset needs to rally 44% to reach the 200-day EMA. That would set it at $33,271. The price is also above the 21-day EMA which is a good thing for the asset. The only resistances present currently are $28,633, $31,283 and the 200 moving average. ABove these, Bitcoin should rally hard back to the old ATH price. Majority of other experts in the industry think this pump is fake. Tyler Swope of Chico Crypto Youtube Channel warns that Bitcoin is going to crash way lower in the coming weeks.  Since the bearish pennant has been invalidated, we look at the long term price action of Bitcoin. The asset has been trading below the (white) trendline, and tried to break out at points (1), (2), and currently (3). The latter trial seems to be gaining some ground, although Bitcoin is not out of the woods yet. Typical breaks of such chart patterns include breakout, followed by a retest, and finally a continuation of the breakout. If the retest fails, then the breakout was fake and the fall is hard and steep. If this breakout was fake, expect BTC to fall to $18764 first before tanking further to $13,309. Tyler presents several catalysts that could contribute to Bitcoin going down next week. The major one is the FOMC meeting where the FED is going to announce their decision on interest rates. The markets are expecting about 75 basis points. If it goes higher then markets drop drastically – the vice versa is true. For comparison, Canada raised their interest rates by 100 basis points, while the European Central Bank (ECB) raised theirs by 50 basis points. Where do you think the interest rates will go? Stay safe and DYOR!"
2022-07-15 09:59:04+00:00,Bitcoin Price: Is it Decision Time Yet for BTC?,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-is-it-decision-time-yet-for-btc/,"Bitcoin has performed poorly since our last analysis. Over the past 7 days, the market has seen several developments, none of which has positively affected the King of Crypto. Bitcoin’s price is $19,883 as of the time of writing. Here is what Bitcoin is likely to do this coming week. Last week, July 7, Bitcoin was trading at around $21,300 after pasting one nice green candle the day before. However, it was a bull trap, and traders who rushed to long Bitcoin lost a lot of funds if not all.  The previous bullish scenario for Bitcoin predicted the asset might rise to $24,724 after breaking out of an ascending triangle. So let’s first examine what happened to this scenario.  As of July 8, BTC was moving up and out of the ascending triangle signifying that bulls were winning. This scenario was predicted to result in a +20% increase to around $25,900. But as you can see from the chart, the 21-day moving average proved tough. Bears regained control and pushed the price down to lows of $18,905. The other bullish scenario was the double bottom pattern which would have been even more lucrative for bulls. It would have resulted in a +48% increase to $31,549. Because of the recent bear move, the double bottom pattern was invalidated and is, as of now, no longer in play. The bearish pattern we explored last week is still in play. Actually, there are two bearish scenarios. BTC price has been trending below the 21-day EMA for over 3 months. It has tried to break above this resistance indicator three times. The third time was last week, on July 8. After this rejection, we expected an average of -34% drop to around $13,764. This has not happened yet, but the prediction is still valid.  Bulls have tried to hold the line, but sooner or later, they will grow tired. The bearish pennant strengthens the case for a bearish Bitcoin. On July 12, the price closed below the bottom trendline of the pennant, signifying more bearish power. The classic chart pattern for breakouts includes a retest before the price continues in the breakout direction. It would seem BTC is retesting the bottom trendline of the pennant before moving downwards. If this is the case, the typical take-profit region (for leverage traders – shorters) would be around $6,169.  There is a possibility that this could be a fake-out but the chances are extremely low. Brace for double-digit losses. "
2022-07-13 11:00:04+00:00,Why Is Bitcoin So Valuable?,https://blockzeit.com/why-is-bitcoin-so-valuable/,"Whether you’ve heard of Bitcoin or are a newcomer to the world of cryptocurrency, you may be wondering why it is so valuable. After all, it’s a currency, a store of value, and decentralized. But what makes Bitcoin different? Its immutability, security, and decentralized nature are all appealing factors. But why is bitcoin valuable?  If you’re not familiar with the emergence of digital money, you might be wondering if Bitcoin is a currency. It is a digital asset created by a pseudonymous inventor (or group of inventors) named Satoshi Nakamoto, designed to function as a currency.  Since its inception in 2008, Bitcoin has received a wide range of responses, including classification as an intangible asset by the South African Revenue Service, legislation in Canada, and the Ministry of Finance in the Czech Republic. The question of whether Bitcoin is a store of value is often asked in the cryptocurrency community. While the system is entirely decentralized, Bitcoin shares some characteristics with traditional currencies. The most important characteristic is scarcity. As such, the store of value cannot be easy to produce, obtain, or use. Its supply is restricted and it rises or falls based on demand. As a result, the price of a single Bitcoin increases as the supply decreases. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that is independent from a governmental institution. It is therefore difficult to counterfeit and reverse. This decentralization also makes it more secure as there is no government or issuing institution backing the currency. In addition, it eliminates the need for a middleman. That means that if someone wants to take advantage of your hard-earned money, they can’t do it through a governmental institution. A lot of people believe that the value of Bitcoin comes from the fact that there’s no government or other entity backing it. Because of this, there is no central authority or entity that can guarantee its value. It is only determined by the market price of BTC. However, some people also think that the value of Bitcoin comes from the fact that it’s not controlled by a government, which is a huge advantage. Unlike government-issued currencies, which can be created indefinitely and have an inflation schedule, a Bitcoin can never be altered. It’s important to note that Bitcoin’s value is derived from the fact that all its transactions are publicly traceable. Because every bitcoin transaction is public, anyone can see who spent the most. Because of this, Bitcoin is valuable because it’s traceable, and this feature is a major reason it is so popular. This transparency, as well as the fact that every transaction is verified over again, make it useful to financial institutions and governments. One reason Bitcoin is valuable is its transparency. The blockchain is a publicly available document, and every transaction is clearly visible. Because each transaction is pseudonymous, each web address is also visible. Bitcoin’s creators are deeply committed to privacy, which makes it attractive for financial settlement of criminal activities. For example, computer hackers have been known to pay in Bitcoins. This makes Bitcoins a valuable commodity in the digital world. The key to Bitcoin’s value is its anonymity. Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a public log, but buyers and sellers can’t be traced. This makes it an ideal currency for illicit activities. In addition to anonymity, the currency is also mostly unregulated, though some governments are considering regulations. These governments worry about taxation and the lack of control over its currency. If that’s not reason enough to be suspicious of the currency, however, the benefits outweigh any risks associated with anonymity. Bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, has increased fivefold since its pre-pandemic days, and the industry has grown to include legions of other blockchains, tokens, and apps. The $985 billion crypto market now includes decentralized finance, or DeFi, platforms for trading and lending; non fungible tokens, or NFTs, that grant owners property rights for things like art or video; and stablecoins, which are supposed to act like crypto dollars, holding a peg to the US dollar and backed by reserve assets. Bitcoin’s volatility is far greater than that of stocks. This makes Bitcoin a riskier asset, but its historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500 encourages many investors to take a little more risk in exchange for potentially higher returns. The price of Bitcoin at the time of this article is $19,864.61 and it remains the largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $379.2 billion.

2022-07-07 16:54:51+00:00,Bitcoin Price: Did BTC Just Form a Bottom?,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-did-btc-just-form-a-bottom/,"Bitcoin bounced off the $19,000 mark and is possibly on the way up back to $30k. As the week comes to a close, Bitcoin price turns green as it continues to push upward. Did Bitcoin form a bottom or will we see more blood? Read on to find out. Previous analysis left us wondering if Bitcoin was going to shed some more blood. The verdict as per the last analysis showed that Bitcoin was going down and the only immediate support was the $19k target. One week later, BTC has bounced off the support and is up about 10% from this support zone. It is also worth noting that Bitcoin is forming two bullish patterns on the daily timeframe. If these two patterns successfully form, Bitcoin might spike back up to $30k and even maybe hit highs of 31k. The current price of Bitcoin is $20,917 On the daily chart, Bitcoin is currently in an ascending triangle. An ascending triangle is a bullish continuation pattern that signals the price of an asset will continue to rise. The price target if Bitcoin breaks out of the ascending triangle is $24,724. On the other hand, Bitcoin is also forming a possible double bottom pattern that might result in a massive Bitcoin run. This rally will see BTC hit $31,549, a +48% increase. While the rally will be a good thing, at $31k, bitcoin will still be slightly below the 200 EMA, which is a crucial indicator when trading financial instruments. If the bulls do a good job pushing the price up, Bitcoin might touch $35k in the rally before cooling down and settling in the $30k range. While all this is good news for investors and enthusiasts alike, there is a bearish scenario that could possibly play out for Bitcoin. This bear scenario carries more weight than the bullish scenarios discussed above. Bitcoin has been trending below the 21-day moving average and every time it touches this indicator, it crashes some more. In (1), after Bitcoin tested the 21 EMA, it crashed by -29%. Following that it consolidates and once more touched the 21 EMA at (2) after which it fell by -38%. Presently, Bitcoin is visiting the 21 EMA for the third time (3).  The size of the drops is not the same and hence taking the average of the first two drops, Bitcoin is expected to drop by -34% in the coming days. This would set it around $13,764.  It looks like the markets must brace for one more ugly crash from the King of Crypto."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."

The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2022-06-30 08:54:57+00:00,Bitcoin Price: BTC Rejects 21-Day EMA Spiking Fears of Further Selling,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-btc-rejects-21-day-ema-spiking-fears-of-further-selling/,"Bitcoin (BTC) price is still trending at the 20k level further sinking the market into extreme fear. Traders and investors alike are not sure whether this asset will sink lower or recover. Our previous analysis shows that BTC is looking bleak. Here is a breakdown of our analysis of Bitcoin’s next move. Last week on our weekly Bitcoin analysis, the asset had begun making some promising recovery. The main target was the 21-day exponential moving average (EMA). This would act as the first resistance support for Bitcoin on its way up. However, if the bulls were going to be pushing rope this week, then a rejection could ensue and would lead the price of Bitcoin down to new lows. The price of Bitcoin last week at the time of analysis was $20,503. Bitcoin was supposed to rally and test the 21-day EMA, putting it at $23,930 – this would have been a 12% increase. However, the asset was only able to rise 6.16% hitting $21,868 before facing rejection. Bitcoin missed the 21 EMA by 5.06%. Bitcoin is trading at $20,050 as of the time of writing and has been trending downwards for the last three days, losing -7%. The previous price action led to the formation of a local support zone at $18,810, which the bears could easily slice through. However, if for some reason the local support decides to hold out, then Bitcoin will have formed a nice double bottom pattern on the daily chart. A double bottom pattern indicates a bullish reversal and could send Bitcoin to $25,447. This would put BTC above the 21-day EMA and ona clear path to the 200 EMA which lies at $37,254. If Bitcoin fails to hold the $18,810 local support, the asset shall fall to $12,342. Most indicators point to further blood in the market over the coming week. Additionally, the crypto market cycle dictates that Bitcoin crashes by -85% to -95% after hitting an ATH price. Presently, Bitcoin is only down -69%. This shows there are some more losses to be incurred before the markets can turn green. Stay tuned for updates and analysis about Bitcoin price every week"
2022-06-23 11:26:30+00:00,Bitcoin Price Consolidates As The Market Waits for the Next Move,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-consolidates-as-the-market-waits-for-the-next-move/,"Bitcoin has had one rollercoaster of a year, playing with the psychology of most traders and liquidating them to a pulp. The majority of traders have lost their life savings in crypto during this bear market, but many more have made life-changing gains.  It is that time of the week again, we get to see what Bitcoin is doing and where it is likely to go next. Enjoy. In this article, on June 16, we called a Bitcoin target of $17,735. We could not have been more accurate. Bitcoin crashed to a low of $17,592 just 2 days later on June 18 before bouncing off this support.  As of the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is $20,503, which is a 0.6% increase in the last 24 hours. Currently, Bitcoin seems to be forming a bearish flag, although it’s not fully formed. It could also be a double bottom on the 1D timeframe. For the bearish scenario, if it forms a bearish flag, this indicates a continuation of the bitcoin sell-off. The markets better prepare for more blood. Digging deeper, the $17500 support is not strong. One good major FUD and bitcoin slides further. If Bitcoin fails to hold the $17,500 support, it could spiral down to $12,372.  If that does not hold, $10,183 is the next support. While all seems bleak, Bitcoin still has some hope of a rally. Currently, BTC is trading way below the 200 EMA on the Daily chart. Moreover, there is a support-turned-resistance that might have possibly formed in the $30,000 region.  The case for a bullish Bitcoin right now is a possible retest to the 21-day EMA. This would put Bitcoin at $23,930 (1). If the bulls have more power, they could try and push up the price to the $28,799 area (2). Beyond this, Bitcoin may try to reach the 200 EMA, putting it at $37,254 (3). If that happens, it would serve as the second retest to the 200 EMA, since the previous one failed. In all honesty, the bearish bitcoin case seems stronger than the bullish one. However, the markets can be unpredictable. For now, let’s see what transpires in the crypto world. More positive news will translate into a bullish rally, while more negative news will just push the price further down."
2022-06-20 09:10:20+00:00,"What Happens If Bitcoin Crashes Below $15,000?",https://blockzeit.com/what-happens-if-bitcoin-crashes-below-fifteen-thousand-dollars/,"An early morning (Saturday, June 18th) slide saw Ethereum fall below its key support level of $1,000 and Bitcoin fall as low as $18,905, representing significant new lows in an already bearish crypto market. In less than two hours, Ethereum plummeted from $1,076 to $986.  Is it time to sell or is now the time to go shopping as all leading cryptos are “on sale”. Bitcoin has dropped nearly 10% in 24 hours and is still trading below $18,801 at the time of writing. Bitcoin was last in the $19,000 range in December 2020. At the time, reaching $19,450 was framed as a “surge” linked to proposed US regulation of stablecoins. The top two “blue chip” cryptocurrencies are now trading below their largely symbolic price thresholds of $20,000 for Bitcoin and $1,000 for Ethereum. Nonetheless, breaching these thresholds could result in a wave of “forced liquidations,” driving prices even lower. Even more notably, Bitcoin today fell below its December 2017 high of $19,834—the peak of the previous bull run, which began on New Year’s Day of that year when BTC broke through $1,000. Bitcoin had never fallen below the peak of its previous bull run in previous bear markets. Ethereum first reached $1,000 in January 2018, only to lose it when Crypto Winter struck in February 2018. It had never fallen below $1,000 since regaining that level in January of last year. Investors and analysts are still looking for the bottom. According to Swan Bitcoin Analyst Sam Callahan, Bitcoin could fall as low as $13,800, representing a drop of more than 80% from it’s all-time high in November 2021. The same thing happened in December 2018, when Bitcoin fell below $3,000 for the first time. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is now around $835 billion, down more than 7% in the last 24 hours. That’s a far cry from 221 days ago, when headlines claimed a $3 trillion crypto market cap. BTC was worth $66,362 at the time, while Ethereum was worth $4,782. As the bear market worsens, crypto investors will look for a bottom to re-enter. As bearish sentiment pervades financial markets, experts weigh in on whether Bitcoin will fall below $15,000—and what will happen if it does. Bitcoin, now firmly in a bear market, is currently trading at just over $18,000, a remarkable drop from it’s all-time high price of nearly $69,000—a plunge that most observers attribute to worsening macroeconomic conditions such as rising inflation and interest rates, renewed currency fears, and Russia’s seemingly never-ending war on Ukraine. At the moment, all eyes are focused on the $20,000 price level, not only because it represents a significant psychological support level, but also because it represents the peak of Bitcoin’s previous bull run in 2017.  However, this may be moot because BTC is already trading below $19,000. Bitcoin has never fallen below the price of the previous bull run’s peak in previous bear markets. The difference this time is that Bitcoin has a much shorter distance to travel to reach that mark. According to Swan Bitcoin Analyst Sam Callahan, based on previous bear market experience, Bitcoin could drop more than 80% from it’s all-time high, as it did in December 2018 when it fell to just above $3,000. This cycle, Bitcoin could fall as low as $13,800. But Callahan isn’t too concerned if it does. “It’s important to note that the investor base for Bitcoin is very different and more sophisticated than in previous bear markets,” Callahan said. “I believe that if Bitcoin fell below $20,000, we would see significant buying pressure at those discounted price levels because Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition remains intact.” One can think of bitcoin purely in terms of a network and by extrapolation the network effect that will be strengthened by increased adoption and institutional development. Blockchain technology and bitcoin aren’t going anywhere-they are here to stay. If one can weather the volatility and stay in the game the future for bitcoin is incredibly bright."

Bitcoin fell below the $20,000 mark to a new low of $18,915. Ethereum fell below $1,000 and is now at $988. According to our previous analysis, the next substantial support level for BTC is between $19,878 and $17,735.  The support level of 17000 dollars is not very strong which makes it possible for Bitcoin to fall to the next level of around $14,000. #Bitcoin, are you okay?

2022-06-16 11:58:58+00:00,Bitcoin Price Crashes 34.6% Wiping Out $500 Bn in Total Marketcap in just 7 Days,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-crashes-34-6-wiping-500-bn-in-marketcap-in-just-7-days/,"Bitcoin just nuked to $20,000! This was an expected scenario, but everyone was hoping it wouldn’t happen. Technical analysis showed there was a possibility of a break to the downside though the fundamentals were pretty strong. Read about our previous Bitcoin analysis. On June 11, 2022, BTC broke the multi-year support zone and tumbled down to $22508 in two huge daily red candles. Initially, we had postulated a bullish bitcoin scenario where it retests the 200 EMA for the second time at around $39045 (Test #2). However, this was not to be. Since June 11, BTC has been on a downward trend with massive selling pressure from the bears.  Some speculate that the Celsius debacle was the tipping point for this asset which caused it to break its support. While this might be the case, it is not the reason for the sustained sell pressure. The first large sell-off ignited a cascade effect of other traders dumping their BTCs on the market, which further pushed the price down. Consulting the Bitcoin chart, it is clear that the blood is not over yet. Bitcoin touched a low of $20079 on June 15, but unfortunately, there is no support there. The next substantial support for Bitcoin is between $19,878 and $17,735.  This zone is important because if it is broken, BTC can crash all the way to the $14,000 region. The recent Bitcoin price action is a result of a chart pattern we examined last week: The bear flag. Now according to the rules of the bearish flag, the Bitcoin sell-off should halt at around $17,735 to $17,200. This might not be what the majority of investors and traders want but the charts do not lie.  Furthermore, the BTC is in a free fall. The $17k support is not as strong as we would like it to be. In short, the case for a bearish Bitcoin is stronger than that of a bullish Bitcoin. The overall market sentiment is: ‘Brace for more blood’"
2022-06-12 11:37:00+00:00,The Value Of Bitcoin: Important Aspects To Take Into Account,https://blockzeit.com/the-value-of-bitcoin-important-aspects-to-take-into-account/,"Bitcoin, over the days, has shown its ability to maintain itself even when the economy is not the most favorable. The decisions that have recently been made at a financial and economic level may affect the valuation of these crypto assets. Still, we must also be aware that digital currencies have their cycles, which are not changed by the most influential economic factors. To learn more about Bitcoin visit: bitcode-prime.deFinancial markets usually make their movements spontaneously unless some activity or external factor arises that modify them. In the case of cryptocurrencies, it can be said that they are affected by external factors that traditionally affect the financial market. Still, two aspects also cause it to change: international regulations and social networks. Bitcoin has recently been seen going up and down. However, it has been more time in the bearish phase than in the bullish phase; for many, the wait for a new stage change is the future of the following months for this digital currency. The announcements of economic measures by the United States, a war in progress, and the continuous intentions to regulate digital assets mean that their value continues to fluctuate uncontrollably. We may be in the presence of a new trend that, according to many experts, is forecast or what comes next year, but the steps to reach new all-time highs are tiny steps.There has been much turbulence that has allowed the modification of the prices of Bitcoin and the rest of the digital currencies. Therefore, the most accurate conclusion is that the fluctuations of this digital market follow the global market trends. The trust of users is the main element that cryptocurrencies have in their favor. In bearish situations like Bitcoin has been going through, users usually protect their digital currencies while waiting for new trends.Trading in a downward trend is not recommended for its users since it generates significant losses; the best thing to do is acquire more coins and wait for the market direction to change. For many, the bearish phase of Bitcoin represents a corrective stage that possibly leads to a rise expected many. Still, there may also be a break in the trajectory, reach a maximum of no more than $34,000 and fall again. The leading digital currency among users and exchange platforms is being harshly criticized after the constant drops it has had at its price. Comparisons with the traditional financial market continue to surface. Still, there are relevant aspects that we must keep clear when it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies.Digital currencies usually move at a price due to supply and demand. However, the imperative need of financial and government entities to regulate them have also caused them to modify their price. Bitcoin is a currency with a particular feature that has made it extremely attractive. That is its ability to be decentralized.So far this year, many have joined the idea of ​​adopting digital currencies as financial tools for marketing, investment, and exchange. To the point that the issue of regulating cryptographic operations is increasingly positioned, such as in the case of Russia and Ukraine, both nations have managed to stay thanks financially to the operability of these currencies, making it clear that the digital age is the future of finance.Thailand, India, and the United Kingdom are the leading countries that have managed cryptocurrencies from various fields. It is why their influence on the variation in the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies is significant, but its impact is greater on China and the United States. The digital market is not exempt from changes due to the effects of the traditional financial market; there are even movements of digital currencies that relatively affect the actions of the conventional market. Bitcoin is going through a new phase in which we must be very alert to the possible dramatic variations that it may have. In a matter of hours, its price can vary and mark a period of profit or loss for users.That is why the increases you are experiencing these days can have a double impact; the exciting thing is to make decisions at the right time so as not to have to manage emotions later in obtaining losses."
2022-06-11 10:32:00+00:00,What Should You Do While Bitcoin Price Rises?,https://blockzeit.com/what-should-you-do-while-bitcoin-price-rises/,"The results of this year have not been positive at all for cryptocurrencies, specifically for Bitcoin. Still, everything points to their values ​​taking off the floor they have touched.  Bitcoin has come to be worth almost 50% less than it was worth in December. That is, nearly $21,000 per coin, a value that has made many investors thinks about what to do with their crypto assets. In a desperate wait, both corporate and private investors have preferred to dismiss the option of selling their digital currencies. For more information visit at: bitcoin-motion.de. It is not easy to know that you lose daily if Bitcoin continues to fall; this characteristic volatility of digital currencies calls into question the potential of the digital financial market, alienating potential investors who contribute to the increase in market capitalization. If there is a feeling that has been mixed with the concept of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, it is distrust; for many investors and users of traditional financial instruments, digital currencies were considered pyramids, scams, or used for illicit negotiations. The elements changed after the rise of companies and their opening to electronic commerce and the adoption of digital currencies as a means of payment for the acquisition of goods and services. Being able to carry out cryptographic operations from the comfort of a Smartphone, in addition to the speed that characterizes it, has allowed more people to make use of these elements of the digital market. The mistrust of these crypto-assets has decreased significantly. Still, the risks that these investments represent are now the greatest fear of people who decide to enter a new digital financial market. Despite the lack of support and regulation by traditional financial institutions, users have taken it upon themselves to provide the necessary support for cryptocurrencies to position themselves on a very attractive step for many. For many crypto investors, what Bitcoin is going through is quite complicated; some doubts arise regarding disposing or spending the Bitcoin that they have or simply leaving them stored and waiting for the course of the market. There are several ways to dispose of cryptocurrencies in your digital wallets, and these are usually the most common: As mentioned in other publications, it is essential to consider that digital currencieshave well-established financial cycles. Therefore, the phases that make them up are usually relatively straightforward. It may be that currently, with the financial, economic, and geopolitical situations that the traditional market is going through, digital currencies have been significantly affected, causing them to enter multiple bearish phases. This phase will not last a lifetime; it is where the corrective phase enters. Finally, the trend is assumed and corrected to give the ordinary course to the displacement of the curve where supply and demand flow independently, achieving the desired balance point. Cryptocurrencies are volatile, and it turns out that trends can last for hours, minutes, or perhaps days and weeks. The impact caused by the bullish trend in Bitcoin is quite positive. However, it creates excellent euphoria that could be counterproductive and take the market to a lower stage than it has previously experienced. That is why when Bitcoin units are stored; it is better to wait for a stable moment to be able to operate. Timely, intelligent, and emotionless decisions are what guarantees success in operations. Cryptocurrencies are experiencing quite drastic changes, so it is suggested to take the financial market calmly since no specific formula tells us what will happen with the digital market."
2022-06-09 14:14:31+00:00,Bitcoin Satoshi Vision and Why Block Size Matters,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-satoshi-vision-and-why-block-size-matters/,"New blockchain exchanges and NFT marketplaces keep spawning many new digital products for sale. You may be curious about how much volume of transaction data is being created. All that data needs to be stored in the blockchain. And if you hadn’t thought about it, you’re probably curious now. The original 2009 Bitcoin blockchain has a block size of 1MB, and can only accommodate a few hundred transactions on average. There have been a few modifications since then, with block sizes increasing in new versions. One of these new blockchains is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision. In this article, we’ll cover the main attractions of this blockchain. However, before we get into those details, let’s quickly understand bitcoin blocks and block sizes. A block is a unit of storage that is basically a database of transaction records. Transaction records include cryptocurrency transactions, Fungible tokens, and NFTs, among other digital assets. Transactions are added to each block by computers participating in the Bitcoin network (miners). Each new transaction in a block contributes to its storage limit determined by the block size. When a block gets filled up, it is chained to a new block through timestamps. That’s where blockchains get their name. Blocks make databases distributable across several computers. They also put a limit on transaction time based on the creation of a new block. This is important to give time to other computers to download other blocks (old and new) to perform mining tasks to verify transactions.  The bigger the block size, the more transactions can be processed at any given time in the blockchain. That means less network congestion due to a high transaction volume, and faster transaction speeds. Newer versions of Bitcoin were created exactly for this reason. Waiting for several hours or even days for a transaction to complete gives a bad user experience, and ultimately hurts the adoption of digital currencies. For miners, faster transactions required a higher fee, and a slower network was becoming costlier for everyone in the long term. That was the problem with the original Bitcoin network. Therefore, it was obvious that something had to change to make the blockchain more efficient in terms of transaction time and scalability. As computers have become more powerful and network speeds have increased steadily, developers have been able to update blockchains. Adding larger block sizes helped offset the initial drawbacks. These upgrades are also called forks. Some of these upgrades were backward compatible, allowing Bitcoins to be used interchangeably with computers using both new and old versions of the software. Other blockchains had codes that were so different that they changed the way the blockchain worked. Forks like Litecoin (4MB Block size) and Bitcoin Cash (8MB block size) were so different that they had to be split from the main blockchain. With more people wanting to invest in Bitcoins, smart contracts, and NFTs, demand for digital assets has only grown. The surging demand has inspired some developers to make a new scalable solution, like the BSV blockchain, for the digital currency and NFT marketplace. Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (also called Bitcoin SV or BSV) is a recent upgrade with some notable differences from the original 2009 Bitcoin blockchain. In technical terms, Bitcoin SV is a hard fork of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain protocol. It was developed in 2018, one year after Bitcoin Cash was created. It comes with its unique digital currency – intuitively called BSV. Bitcoin SV currently has over 1,000 developers actively working on it to ensure its stable and secured real-time performance. One of the biggest differences between Bitcoin SV and the earlier versions is the block size, which is indeed much larger than the standard BTC block size. BSV currently has a block size of a whopping 4GB. That’s a massive increase compared to the OG Bitcoin block size, which brings additional benefits. When it comes to blocks, size really matters. Here is how BSV is making headlines by focusing on bigger chunks in the blockchain. The large block sizes mean that miners can quickly add new transactions to an existing block. That makes the blockchain very fast, even in times of high workloads. BSV takes away all the hassle associated with standard Bitcoin protocols. The BSV blockchain conducts about 300 transactions per second with a peak load capacity of 2,800. In comparison, the BTC blockchain manages a mere 4.6 transactions per second. BSV was made to work with heavy traffic in mind. It can handle several thousand users in one second. The developers behind BSV intend to compete with payment systems like Visa and MasterCard. With its large block size, BSV can reach this potential easily, if not go further. Because BSV is efficient in processing transactions, it has a low cost for miners and users. From a customer’s perspective, BSV is an attractive digital currency if you don’t want to pay high costs for a quick crypto transfer. Blockchain tech is not limited to crypto transactions anymore. Developers have found ways to cram other forms of digital assets like contracts, personal records, and images into the blockchain. That means there’s room for customized app databases to be stored in a single blockchain. Imagine a hospital application that stores electronic medical records; or an NFT marketplace that stores the digital artwork, all inside blocks in a decentralized database. Bitcoin SV has blocks large enough to fit them in. Over the years, Bitcoin has had many competing development groups, resulting in the creation of various protocols that diverged from Satoshi’s original ideas. Bitcoin SV, on the other hand, has distilled Bitcoin back to its purest form and set its protocol in immutable code, retaining the key economic systems and functionality described in the Bitcoin white-paper while combining it with cutting-edge technology, allowing thousands of enterprises and developers to safely build upon it. As Bitcoin matures the BSV project is well-worth keeping an eye on."

According to Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Founder of Binance, “29 shopping malls, 13 hotels, and four mixed-use communities now accept crypto through Binance Pay. Adoption continues.” Operating in 17 countries globally, Majid Al Futtaim will drive exponential growth, both in crypto and Binance exchange. Majid Al Futtaim boasts 423 Carrefour stores in 16 of the 17 countries. Moreover, they have 11 hotels in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) alone and operate over 600 cinema screens. We are talking billions of dollars here. CZ believes that integrating Web 3.0 technology with such a large business will allow customers to tap into the innovative ways of the blockchain space. Furthermore, he believes that blockchain can give this billion-dollar franchise new ways to engage their customers by providing new ways and methods of payment.  The two companies plan to launch non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Binance NFT marketplace. Further down the road, the partnership will lead to developing a web3 wallet that will hold different cryptos. The goal is to make Majid Al Futtaim the largest global retailer to accept more than forty (40) cryptocurrencies as payment. Binance Pay will enable all this. We are witnessing crypto adoption at a tremendous rate just six months into 2022. So far, two countries have embraced crypto, and several states in the USA are looking into crypto adoption. The development covered here touches on a different niche: Multinational companies joining the bandwagon for crypto adoption. As we enter into the second half of the year, more good news could be loading for crypto adoption"
2022-06-06 18:35:16+00:00,KenGen in Kenya to Offer Surplus Geothermal Power to Bitcoin Miners,https://blockzeit.com/kengen-in-kenya-to-offer-surplus-geothermal-power-to-bitcoin-miners/,"KenGen, a hydroelectric power generation company based in Kenya is looking to offer surplus energy produced to Bitcoin miners. The Kenya Electricity Generating Company PLC (KenGen) produces more than 75% of all power usage in the country. This move comes just weeks after the Central African Republic made Bitcoin a legal tender. KenGen Director of Geothermal Development, Peketsa Mwangi said that crypto mining is an energy-intensive operation. Therefore, the extra energy will be greatly beneficial to both local and foreign miners. However, KenGen requires all miners to set up their mining rigs at the KenGen geothermal headquarters in Olkaria, Naivasha. This is about 123km from Nairobi, the capital city of the country. The move will see a flurry of crypto activity in the country. Foreign digital investors might even consider investing in the country as they speculate it becoming the largest crypto hub in Africa. CAR is already facing opposition from the World Bank, and nothing less of this criticism is expected for Kenya. The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has already begun research on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). However, nothing tangible has come of it yet. KenGen is a government company and hence, this move might be indicating some measure of support from the government for crypto. On the flip side, the condition that all miners must perform their operation on-site is rather suspicious. “We’ll have them here because we have the space and the power is near, which helps with stability.”, says Peketsa. Going off on a tangent, Nigeria feigned support for crypto for years, until February 8, 2021, when they banned it. They further went ahead to create their own digital currency, the e-Naira. Will something of this sort happen in Kenya? Only time will tell. This move echoes back to how El Salvador is using energy from a volcano to mine Bitcoin for the nation. While El Salvador and Kenya are worlds apart in terms of governing structure and economy, the two can be commended for being at the forefront of positive crypto adoption."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2022-06-03 08:40:20+00:00,Paraguay Approves Crypto Regulation Bill Despite Opposition,https://blockzeit.com/paraguay-approves-crypto-regulation-bill-despite-opposition/,"After El Salvador and the Central African Republic (CAR) approved Bitcoin as legal tender, other nations hurrying to catch up and put in place regulations for this unique asset class. Paraguay’s Chamber of Deputies approved a bill regulating crypto mining and trading with a 40-12 vote.  2021 has been the year with the most crypto adoption. However, 2022 seems like it will have more impact on the world in terms of Bitcoin and blockchain adoption. In a special session, the deputies voted by a margin of 40 to 12 in support of passing the draft.The bill has been in the Senate debate since July 2021 and it now awaits ratification before being passed on to President Mario Abdo Benítez for signing. The bill proposes control for crypto exchanges and mining firms. This bill, once signed into law, aims to control activities involving digital assets such as crypto trading and mining. The main goal of the bill is to commercialize crypto and provide legal, financial, and fiscal security to traders and investors. Additionally, the new law requires that crypto exchanges be registered with the anti-money-laundering agency of Paraguay and will fall under “virtual asset service providers.” Following this adoption, Paraguay will become a global hub for crypto miners and investors as well. Paraguay is a mining haven for crypto miners due to its cheap electricity. In Paraguay, electricity costs $0.05 per kW/h. This is the lowest rate in all of Latin America. Crypto adoption is rising fast globally. Nations are embracing crypto and blockchain technology. As the world races towards 5G and 6G tech, nations and companies must align themselves. The nations that do this early will be the ones that make the most profit in the future. Kudos Paraguay!"
2022-06-03 06:11:47+00:00,Bitcoin Price Tries and Fails to Break Out of the 6-month Descent,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-tries-and-fails-to-break-out-of-the-6-month-descent/,"Bitcoin price has been struggling for the past month now, remaining in the $30k range. More worrying is the fact that this range is akin to the edge of a cliff. If Bitcoin falls off the edge of this $30k cliff, the fall will be broken by the $13k support.  Traders and investors have mixed sentiments about this asset. Two weeks ago we published an outlook on Bitcoin price and it was still stuck at the $30k support level. Has anything changed? Let’s look at the Bitcoin price trend this week. The current price of Bitcoin is $30,502 (at the time of writing: 7:45 AM (UTC+3)). This signifies a 2.3% increase in the last 24 hours. Also, the Bitcoin dominance has risen up by 4% to 46.92%, showing that BTC has more impact in the market right now, compared to a week ago. Bitcoin has been on a downward spiral since March 30, 2022.  It has tried to break out of the downward trend by testing the upper trend line twice now. However, the efforts have been futile. On June 2, 2022, BTC tried to break out again but failed, showing urther weakness by the bulls. In another different prospect, Bitcoin recently retested and is presently hugging the 21 EMA. If it manages to break above this moving average, BTC should enter a brief rally towards the $40k mark. This should comprise the second 200 EMA test. Here it will meet one of two fates: Break up and above the 200 EMA, or get rejected and plummet back down to $30k (and possibly lower). It is worth noting that should BTC manage to break above the 200 EMA, it will head to $45k, $48k and then $51k and after this, it’s an open road back to its all-time high price. Bitcoin fundamentals are strong as always. What we need to worry about are the technicals. Paraguay now supports crypto, a move that is good for Bitcoin adoption and overall price in the long term. Back to TA, we shall keep you updated every week on how Bitcoin price trends are moving – our very portfolios depend on it."
2022-05-26 18:22:41+00:00,Sango: World Bank Criticizes the Central African Republic’s Crypto Plans,https://blockzeit.com/sango-central-african-republics-crypto-plans/,"The World Bank has raised concerns about “Sango”, the new crypto investment center being built in the Central African Republic (CAR). The criticism further touches on the country’s adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) as the legal tender announced at the end of April 2022. This is after it became the second country to adopt Bitcoin. The leading causes cited are transparency and the move’s consequences on the general financial inclusion. CAR became the second country to make BTC a legal tender after El Salvador. The move took place in early April under the full support of the nation’s president, Faustin Archange Touadera. The state of crypto adoption in CAR has further developed in the weeks since the announcement. On May 24, 2022, the president announced a plan to launch the nation’s first crypto hub, identified as “Sango.”According to president Archange, Sango aims to create a way toward a digital future with endless opportunities. The nation will move ahead to buy land (using Bitcoin) and build a digital national bank. The country has received approval for $35 million from the World Bank to digitize the public sector. However, the World Bank said the grant had nothing to do with “any cryptocurrency initiative.” The World Bank has critical of Bitcoin adoption by nation-states. When El Salvador attempted to legalize BTC, the world bank threw cold water on the plans by citing environmental and energy hazards. In the case of CAR, the World Bank is concerned about:“Transparency as well as potential implications for financial inclusion, the financial sector and public finance at large, in addition to environmental shortcomings,”  Additionally, the World Bank maintains that, “It is important that the relevant regional institutions, such as the central bank and the banking authorities, are fully consulted and remain in the driver’s seat.” Because of these reasons, the institution identifies the funding of the crypto project to be physically impossible.Despite this stand by the famous World lender, the dislike of the CFA Franc is rising, while the crypto adoption rates continue to skyrocket in the country. A section of the populace does not have access to the internet, meaning they can’t use Bitcoin and crypto. The CAR government will need to rectify this as soon as possible in order to ensure Bitcoin adoption is not hampered. The World Bank’s disdain for Bitcoin is clear. No bank likes Bitcoin since it puts them out of business. Therefore, the organization will do and say anything to discredit bitcoin and cryptocurrency. However, the revolution is strong, and the best bet they have is to try and control the growth. Due to volatility, Bitcoin is down 30% this year. The bank can very well use this information to strengthen its case. However, the fact remains that BTC is the best asset class in the last decade. This means that any nation that had invested in Bitcoin 11 years ago, would be one of the richest (and debt-free) nations in the world today. CAR will survive."
2022-05-23 15:55:45+00:00,Bitcoin Pizza Day: The Best Mistake in the History of Crypto,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-pizza-day-the-best-mistake-in-the-history-of-crypto/,"It is that time of the year again – Bitcoin Pizza Day! On May 22, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz traded 10,000 BTC for two pizzas at Papa John’s pizza place. Laszlo was a software engineer and also a Bitcoin advocate at the time. Over the years, many have jested at him for his reckless decision, while others have praised him for giving Bitcoin its first use case. 10,000 BTC is worth almost $400 million today. The global Bitcoin community celebrates this event because Bitcoin went through a revolution of sorts on that day. It went from just being a potentially revolutionary form of finance, to actual sound money. 2010 was just 2 years after the 2008 housing market crash. People were still recovering from the global financial crisis and had questions about the economic models and policies back then. Moreover, real doubt was beginning to spread around about the legitimacy of fiat currency as a store of value. Bitcoin offered new hope to the people. The last 12 years have been a rollercoaster for Bitcoin and its community. China has banned bitcoin over 10 times in the last 10 years while the mainstream media has pronounced Bitcoin dead over 400 times. Yet, this dynamic asset keeps rising AND RISING. Over the past decade, Bitcoin has risen by over 9,000,000%. This means that if you bought just $100 worth of Bitcoin in 2010, you have over $9,000,100 right now. Bitcoin is substantially higher and in a better place than 10 years ago, not just price-wise, but also fundamentally. Several nations, including Brazil, El Salvador, and the Central African Republic have committed to making Bitcoin legal tender. Moreover, multi-national corporations like Microstrategy, Tesla, Square Inc., and Microsoft have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Moving forward, Bitcoin has its eyes on much larger prey, mainly the United States. However, this prey is not going to be easy to take down. The Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) has been breathing down Bitcoin evangelists’ necks. Bitcoin’s future, however, seems bright considering where it started. Bitcoin has always been a volatile currency but the recent rally has surprised many experts. The bitcoin community has grown and now you can buy all the Pizza you want using Bitcoin at hundreds of different restaurants around the world. The transactions are not only fast, but also very cheap. The goal of Bitcoin Pizza Day, which was to make cryptocurrency mainstream, has definitely been achieved so far."

Investors everywhere are in panic mode as Bitcoin persists below the 200 EMA. Currently, the Bitcoin price is $29336. It is a losing battle for the bulls as bears exert more pressure on this asset. Despite this downward pressure, Bitcoin adoption continues to be on the rise. How will Bitcoin fare in the coming days and months? Consulting the charts, it looks like Bitcoin is going to be posting new lows soon. The daily Bitcoin chart is showing a bearish pennant forming. Basically, a bearish pennant is a technical analysis trading pattern. It indicates that the downward price trend is likely to continue.   The worrying factor here is that if Bitcoin breaks below $28913, then the next strongest support is at $17533, and after that $12,385.  Simply put, there is little chance of a bullish move from Bitcoin. However, if it does happen, it will be because $28913 is a strong zone of support that has been tested twice before on a macro scale. Apart from this, Bitcoin has a lot of bullish fundamentals around it. Many countries and companies continue to look into this asset and have plans of adopting it in the future. The latest of these developments is the Brazilian Stock exchange, B3, adding Bitcoin futures. Bitcoin fundamentals are not really a strong indicator for short-term price movements. The technical analysis predicts a blood bath soon for Bitcoin, and the entire crypto (because of Bitcoin’s dominance). However, one or more years from now, Bitcoin should be back to all-time highs if not higher. When Bitcoin started actively trading years ago, concentrating on the short-term charts would have driven you to sell out early because of volatility. However, fundamentals have always superseded technicals."

This decision could have far-reaching implications for the future of Bitcoin and other digital currencies in China. The decision about how bitcoin is recognized as property by the Chinese government has caused a lot of confusion and concern among investors around the world.  The court’s official WeChat account posted a notice last week stating: “In the actual trial practice, the People’s Court has formed a unified opinion on the legal position of bitcoin, and identified it as a virtual property.” In the actual trial practice, the People’s Court has formed a unified opinion on the legal position of bitcoin, and identified it as a virtual property. While some countries like Russia (and Ukraine) have already legalized cryptocurrency trading, other countries are still debating whether or not they should follow suit, with many detractors pointing to El Salvador’s issues with bitcoin adoption. The “Bitcoin Case” as it is known in China is a legal battle that has been going on for two years and continues to unfold. The plaintiff, Mr. Cheng Mou from Shanghai filed a lawsuit against defendant named Mr. Shi, demanding they return one bitcoin (BTC) which was given as compensation after an accident happened at work resulting in injury sustained by him during his recovery period; however the defendant refused payment so their dispute went all the way up through local courts before settling last year when they entered meditation. Liu Yang a Beijing-based lawyer from the high-profile Deheng Law Firm says that this ruling will have significant implications for civil disputes involving bitcoin in the Shanghai area, as well as other tech-heavy cities such as Shenzhen."

It should be noted that this tax is separate from another 30% tax on crypto profits that was already instituted on April 1, 2022. It’s no secret that crypto gives its investors handsome profits. However, governments all over the world would like to get a piece of these profits. They achieve this by imposing heavy taxes upon crypto investors. According to reports, the goods and services tax (GST) Council created a committee that would soon impose a 28% tax on all services and activities related to crypto. On top of the 28% GST, crypto investors in India are already facing a 30% tax on any crypto income. In addition to that, a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) will begin to be imposed on July 1, 2022.Crypto activities that will incur taxes include sales and purchase of crypto tokens on exchanges, holding tokens in crypto wallets, and also staking cryptocurrencies. The GST Council will examine any and all activities concerned with crypto before arriving at a decision. The news created havoc in the crypto community which is already feeling the heat of the drastic price crashes in the crypto markets. Frustrated industry enthusiasts, including traders and investors, argue that crypto is an asset class with different use cases across industries. They also argue that crypto is not a gambling or luxury industry and hence, does not deserve such hefty taxes.The Director of Public Policy at WazirX, an Indian-based crypto exchange said that “the industry is open to dialogue with the larger GST Council on such matters.” Further on that note, Vikram Subburaj, the CEO of Giottus Crypto Exchange is pleading with the government to provide more clarity on the 28% GST. He argues that “the 28% GST on investment assets will push a lot of people into non-compliance.” Blockchain is a rapidly emerging technology and has the potential to shape the future of the Internet and finance. By imposing such unrealistic taxes, India is limiting its own future economic growth. A forceful approach by the Indian government to kill crypto might lead to the death of a potential trillion-dollar opportunity."
2022-05-11 13:23:24+00:00,"Turn Out The Lights The Bitcoin Party May Be Over: BTC Plummets Below $35,000",https://blockzeit.com/turn-out-the-lights-the-bitcoin-party-may-be-over-btc-plummets/,"Just when you thought the Bitcoin price couldn’t go any lower, it did. For the first time since January 2022, the bitcoin price has fallen below $35,000 per coin. This is a far cry from the all-time high Bitcoin price of $69,000 that was reached just a few months ago. Michael Saylor? He’s still buying. Bitcoin fell below $35,000 on Sunday morning, having dropped nearly 4% in the previous 24 hours and nearly 9% in the previous seven days. According to CoinMarketCap data, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap has dropped to $658 billion. On March 28, the figure had risen to more than $900 billion. There are a few factors at play. First, there’s the overall market sell-off that has been happening in recent weeks. This has caused investors to pull money out of bitcoin and other risky assets and move it into safer haven investments like gold. Another factor is the increasing regulation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In the past week, we’ve seen China crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading, and India announce plans to do the same. This increased regulation is making some investors nervous about investing in Bitcoin. Finally, there’s simply been a lot of bad news surrounding bitcoin lately. From hacking scandals to regulatory crackdowns, it seems like Bitcoin can’t catch a break. This negative news has likely contributed to the Bitcoin price decline. Continued inflation fears, the war in Ukraine and political instability in the United States of all places, didn’t help Bitcoin either. So, where does bitcoin go from here? It’s hard to say. The Bitcoin price is highly volatile and can move up or down rapidly. However, given the current market conditions and negative news surrounding Bitcoin, it’s likely that the Bitcoin price will continue to fall in the short-term. A CoinShares report shows institutional investors began exiting from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds more than a week ago. Bitcoin outflows totaled $133 million in the previous week, the highest since June 2021. As of this writing, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down nearly 5% in the previous day and nearly 8% in the previous seven days, trading at around $2,549. CoinMarketCap data shows other notable coins were also lagging. ApeCoin (APE) was down 8% in 24 hours (and 32% in seven days) to $11.69, Terra’s LUNA was down more than 15% in 24 hours to $61.68, and Avalanche (AVAX) was down more than 7% to $52.38 on the day. Amp (AMP) is in danger of being delisted from Coinbase as the price of the token is nearing 1 cent. If you’re looking to buy Bitcoin despite the price decline, make sure you do so with caution. There are a fair share of scams and risks involved in buying Bitcoin, so make sure you understand what you’re doing before investing any money and buy through a legit exchange. "
2022-05-10 13:35:22+00:00,Bitcoin Price Down 50% From Its All-time High After Shedding Another 5%,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-down-50-from-its-all-time-high/,"The crypto markets today woke up to a sea of red after Bitcoin price crashed a further 5% from last week’s lows. This fresh crash brought it down to a new 6-month low of $30,269 and has many investors panicking. Last week, traders were at a loss at what direction Bitcoin would take, following the FED interest rate announcement. After relatively good news came from Jerome Powell, Bitcoin saw some relief. However, it seems the optimism is fading away. As of May 9, 2022, Bitcoin and other crypto-assets registered fresh 2022 lows. This erratic and volatile price action from Bitcoin has investors panicking as shown by the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index.  Bitcoin is currently trading at $31,399, which is a crucial zone of support for the asset’s price.  If Bitcoin breaks below this zone, we could witness a free fall to $13,000 sooner rather than later. However, there is still some optimism for bitcoin supporters. $30,000 has been quite a strong support zone historically and hence, there is really not much to worry about. The support has held its ground approximately four times between January and July 2021.  Trading gurus and financial consultants took to social media and anywhere they could get a platform to air their views about the recent crash and bitcoin’s future. While the majority of experts have argued that Bitcoin is gold 2.0, the price of the asset seems to suggest that investors don’t really have faith in it as a store of value in times of economic instability such as now.  Josh Lim, head of derivatives at Genesis Global Trading thinks that we are witnessing a slow meltdown because the long-term bitcoin holders have been selling. One of the most famous Bitcoin permabull, Michael Novogratz, warned that he sees things getting worse before they get better. Novogratz said,  “Crypto probably trades correlated to the Nasdaq until we hit a new equilibrium,” The Bitcoin chart is not looking pretty. All indicators point to a more difficult and volatile market in the coming weeks and possibly months. However, as Mr. Novogratz says, once equilibrium has been achieved, we can expect to see a bitcoin price bounce of epic proportions. Until then, we’re watching carefully to see how the market fares."
2022-05-10 07:55:10+00:00,What Happens After All Bitcoin Has Been Mined?,https://blockzeit.com/what-happens-after-all-bitcoin-has-been-mined/,"Bitcoin is in freefall, down over 50% from an all time high in November so what better time than now to find out what happens after all bitcoin has been mined. Bitcoin is a digital asset and a payment system created by a mysterious individual (or individuals) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public decentralized ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin is unique in that there are a finite number of them capped at 21 million and this number is hard-wired into Bitcoin code-meaning it can never be changed. At the time of this writing, there were just over 19 million Bitcoins in circulation. That means there are only 2 million left to be mined. When all the Bitcoins have been mined, what happens to the protocol? Will it continue to function as it does now? Or will something else happen?  When all 21 million Bitcoins are mined, that will be the end of the supply. No more new Bitcoins will ever be created. Ever. This could happen as early as 2140, though some estimates say it won’t happen until 2160 or later. What is known is the total supply, which is capped at 21 million. No new Bitcoins will be issued after the maximum number of Bitcoins is reached, even if that number is ultimately slightly less than 21 million. Bitcoin transactions will continue to be pooled and processed, and Bitcoin miners will be rewarded, but most likely only with transaction processing fees.  Bitcoin reaching its upper supply limit is likely to have an impact on Bitcoin miners, but how much depends on how Bitcoin evolves as a cryptocurrency. If the Bitcoin blockchain processes a large number of transactions in 2140, Bitcoin miners may still be able to profit solely from transaction processing fees. If Bitcoin in 2140 is primarily used as a store of value rather than for daily purchases, miners can still profit—even with low transaction volumes and the disappearance of block rewards. Miners can charge high transaction fees to process high-value or large batches of transactions, with more efficient “layer 2” blockchains like the Lightning Network collaborating with the Bitcoin blockchain to facilitate daily Bitcoin spending. For starters, transaction fees will likely increase. Right now, miners are paid based on the number of Bitcoins they mine. But once all 21 million have been mined, they’ll only be paid by transaction fees. This could cause problems for Bitcoin’s scalability. As more and more people use Bitcoin, transaction fees will likely increase. If Bitcoin is used for small transactions (like buying coffee), the fees could become too expensive. To prevent this, the Bitcoin community is working on a second-layer solution called the Lightning Network. The Lightning Network would allow for smaller transactions to be made off-chain. This would make Bitcoin more scalable (and faster) and could help keep fees low. It’s also possible that a new cryptocurrency could be created to replace Bitcoin. This has happened before with other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Litecoin. If Bitcoin becomes too expensive or difficult to use, another cryptocurrency could take its place. Since Bitcoin’s inception in 2009, nearly 19 million Bitcoins, or 90% of the total, have been mined. Nonetheless, current estimates indicate that the final Bitcoin will not be minted until around 2140. The rate of new Bitcoin mining is expected to slow over time. Every 210,000 blocks, the reward for mining each block of Bitcoin, which is done every 10 minutes, is cut in half. This occurs roughly every four years. The reward per block had decreased from its initial reward of 50 BTC per block in 2009 to just 6.25 Bitcoin by 2022. To date, El Salvador is the only country that has made Bitcoin legal tender. El Salvador became the world’s first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in September, attracting global media attention but also criticism from the opposition and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which warned the country not to make Bitcoin legal tender due to the risks associated with the cryptocurrency’s volatility. To raise funds, the country is now issuing Bitcoin-backed “Volcano Bonds“. However, no new Bitcoins will be created once the 21-million coin limit has been reached. Reaching this supply limit is likely to have the greatest impact on Bitcoin miners, but Bitcoin investors may also suffer as a result. At the time of this article the price of Bitcoin (BTC) was $31,443, down over 50% from an all time high reached in November 2021 of $68,000 yet remains the most popular cryptocurrency by a wide margin."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2022-05-05 07:14:10+00:00,"Bitcoin Jumps to $40,000 after the Fed Interest Rates Announcement",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-jumps-to-40000-after-the-fed-interest-rates-announcement/,"Jerome Powell just made the Fed interest rate announcements and the increase is much less than Wednesday’s proposal. Due to that, stocks are bouncing higher and Bitcoin has also not been left behind. It is almost back to the $40,000 mark, which is a 5.6% increase in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin price trends have been of much concern for the better part of the first quarter of 2022. The majority of cryptocurrency traders expected the king of crypto to reclaim its previous all-time high price as it heads to $100,000. However, Bitcoin has behaved in a completely unpredictable manner, trading below $40,000 most of the time, and maintaining low volumes. Where will the Bitcoin price go from here? Let’s find out what experts and charts are saying. Over the weekend, the Bitcoin price fell below a key support zone as a result of some developments in the space. Bitcoin hit lows of $37,600 before going a short recovery rally of 4% on May 4, 2022. Currently, Bitcoin is in a long descending channel that now spans 26 days, and has been unable to break out.   Bitcoin Price Range before Fed Hike The Bitcoin greed and fear index remains steadily at a fear, indicating that the market is fearful. This indicator is able to tell the general sentiments of the market about Bitcoin. The main trigger behind the BTC crash was the scheduled Federal Reserve interest rates report announcement. Experts have warned that despite the previous crash to $37,600, Bitcoin could see a major crash by as much as $10,000 to end up sitting at $27,000. Bitcoin is a volatile asset to hold and such moves don’t really scare crypto traders and investors. For instance, after the 2017 bull market, Bitcoin crashed by 85% from $19,800 to $3,500. If Bitcoin were to play out the same scenario, it would crash all the way to $10,000. According to crypto analysts from Arcane Research, the correlation factor between Nasdaq Stock and Bitcoin is 0.7. For context, a correlation factor of 1 means the two assets are perfectly in sync, while a correlation of -1 means they always move in opposite directions. A 0.7 correlation factor means these two assets, albeit from different financial systems, are likely moving in tandem.   Despite this overwhelming statistical data, the experts argue that Bitcoin is susceptible to macroeconomic forces, similar to stocks in the equity market. They deduce this is the reason Bitcoin appears to be following Nasdaq’s price movement. The markets were reacting to Jerome Powell’s half-percentage point interest rate increase. The markets had taken a tank after an even larger interest rate increase was proposed on Wednesday. Among other factors, the FED interest rates announcement was the biggest reason for an imminent Bitcoin crash. Aside from that, Bitcoin is doing better than ever. Central African Republic (CAR) just became the second country in the world to declare Bitcoin a legal tender. This is great news for Bitcoin’s adoption and hints at positive sentiments for the king of crypto. For now, Bitcoin has averted the largest risk of a price crash. "
2022-05-02 05:12:33+00:00,Warren Buffett Hates Bitcoin: Who Cares?,https://blockzeit.com/warren-buffett-hates-bitcoin-who-cares/,"Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, recently said wouldn’t buy all of Bitcoin in the world even if offered at $25.  News flash Buffett: No one is going to sell you all the Bitcoin in the world for $25. The current price of BTC is $38,678.40 per coin so good luck getting someone to sell you all the Bitcoin in the world for $25. For someone this wealthy, Buffett sure says a lot of stupid things. Speaking of stupid, his long-time partner and right-hand man, Charlie Munger, believes Bitcoin is “stupid and evil”, and that it makes him “look bad. Based on Munger’s idiotic comments in the past about Bitcoin he doesn’t need any help looking bad as he does a great job embarrassing himself on his own. During Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholders meeting on Saturday, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger discussed Bitcoin. Buffett is the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Berkshire Hathaway. Munger is the company’s vice chairman of the board and is often referred to as his right-hand man.  The “Oracle of Omaha”, famous for saying Bitcoin is “probably rat poison squared,” explained why he would not purchase BTC in detail. He stated: I’m not sure if it will rise or fall in the next year, five, or ten years. But one thing I’m certain of is that it doesn’t produce anything… It has magic, and people have attached magic to a variety of things. Buffett provided several examples. He would pay $25 billion for a 1% stake in all farmland in the United States. He would also pay $25 billion for a 1% stake in all of the country’s apartment buildings. “I’d write you a check this afternoon,” he said confidently. However, when it comes to purchasing Bitcoin, he goes into detail: “Now, if you told me you owned all of the Bitcoin in the world and offered me $25 for it, I wouldn’t take it because I wouldn’t know what to do with it. In any case, I’d have to sell it back to you. It’s not going to change anything. Unlike Bitcoin, “the apartments will produce rent and the farms will produce food,” he emphasized. What a genius. It is statements like this that are so astoundingly stupid that one wonders how Buffet made any money in the stock market. And to be honest, what he does isn’t rocket science-he just buys stock in established companies and holds on to it.  If you live to be 138 like Buffett and Munger then you’re bound to make money-which is what they’ve done and now they want to make sure that fiat currency remains the global standard and for some reason fears Bitcoin.  Nobody is making Buffett and Munger buy Bitcoin and nobody I know cares what they think about it. Buffett missed the boat on Amazon because he apparently didn’t understand the company. Same with Bitcoin. The Berkshire CEO then went on to bloviate about the US dollar. “Assets must deliver something to someone in order to be valuable.” And there is only one accepted currency. You can come up with anything — we can put up Berkshire coins… But, at the end of the day, this is money,” he added, holding up a $20 bill. “And there is no reason in the world why the United States government… will allow Berkshire money to replace theirs.” Buffett, on the other hand, invests in the Bitcoin-friendly digital bank Nubank, which provides BTC investments. The hypocrisy is stunning. Munger also reiterated his scathing view of Bitcoin in alignment with his boss, Buffett. The vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway stated: In my life, I try to avoid things that are stupid, evil, or make me look bad in comparison to someone else — and Bitcoin fulfills all three criteria. “First and foremost, it’s stupid because it’s still very likely to go to zero,” Munger continued. “It’s evil because it jeopardizes the Federal Reserve system… Third, it makes us look foolish in comparison to China’s Communist leader. He was astute enough to forbid the use of Bitcoin in China.” In response to a question about what single investment should be made to protect against high inflation, the Berkshire vice chairman mentioned bitcoin. He stated: If you have your own retirement account and your friendly adviser suggests you invest it all in Bitcoin, simply say ‘no.’ Again, Buffett shows his ignorance.  Data highlighted that BTC (Bitcoin) significantly outperformed Meta by 46.74%, followed by Tesla at 18.37%. Furthermore, BTC also outperformed Amazon by 3.78%, followed by Alphabet at 1.84% Munger has been a vocal critic of Bitcoin. In February, he said the government should outlaw cryptocurrency, referring to it as a “venereal disease.” He has previously praised China (a country that imprisons and kills its citizens for practicing religion) for banning cryptocurrency, stating that he wishes cryptocurrency had never been invented. He called Bitcoin “disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization” in May of last year. Hey, Munger! Maybe the problem isn’t Bitcoin but rather a totalitarian regime that prevents free speech and imprisons and kills its own citizens for “crimes” of conscience. What an idiot. As we are perched on the cusp of the Metaverse, listening to someone like Warren Buffett rant about bitcoin is lunacy. Buffett didn’t believe in the world’s most valuable company (Amazon) enough to invest in it, and now he’s warning you to stay away from the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency. Buffett and Munger have no clue. Invest in bitcoin. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not reflect Blockzeit.

Panama has joined the growing list of countries that have moved forward with cryptocurrency legislation after the National Assembly passed a bill that allows citizens to use digital assets for public and private business.  Should the country’s President Laurentino Cortizo go ahead and sign the bill into law, Panamanians will also be able to pay their taxes using cryptocurrency. According to a Reuters report, the project will also allow citizens to buy goods and services in cryptocurrencies at any legally operated civil or commercial business. Speaking during an interview with the local media, Gabriel Silva, a member of the National Assembly and one of the lawmakers promoting the bill, said:   “This bill seeks for Panama to become a hub of technology innovation in Latin America.”  The independent lawmaker who sponsored the bill explained that the law was broader in scope than the law passed by El Salvador last year that made Bitcoin legal tender. The bill also covers matters related to the trade and use of digital assets, the issuance of digital securities, new payment systems, and the tokenization of precious metals. The law aims to promote “The use of distributed ledger technology and blockchain in the digitalization of the identity of natural and legal persons in or from the Republic of Panama and as a means to make the public function transparent,” Tokenization is when rights to an asset are converted into digital formats. Gabriel Silva added:  “We’re seeing the emergence of many different types of crypto assets like works of art […] that’s why we didn’t want to limit ourselves only to cryptocurrencies.” Panama is on the European Union’s list of tax havens. The new law permits Panamanians to use cryptocurrencies as payment for any civil or commercial operation not prohibited by law in the country. Romain Dromard, chief executive officer at financial investment advisory firm K&B Family Office, said the crypto bill would not help it appear more transparent. The news came only a day after reports that the Central African Republic (CAR) had become the second country to make Bitcoin legal tender. According to the country’s Finance Minister, Herve Ndoba, CAR has been working to create a legal framework around cryptocurrencies that will focus on defining how citizens can interact with digital assets. Ndoba said the Central African Republic was not trying to mimic El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021."
2022-04-28 04:20:21+00:00,The Central African Republic is Second Country to Adopt Bitcoin as Legal Tender,https://blockzeit.com/the-central-african-republic-is-second-country-to-adopt-bitcoin-as-legal-tender/,"A statement from the president’s office said the government planned to prioritize economic recovery policies to give citizens immediate relief. Residents of the Central African Republic (CAR) can now use Bitcoin as legal currency alongside the West African CFA franc after the country’s president signed a cryptocurrency bill adopted by deputies last week. According to a statement from President Faustin Archange Touadera’s office, the National Assembly passed and signed a bill drafted by the minister of the digital economy, Gourna Zacko, and the minister of finance and budget Calixte Nganongo. The move comes the day after the country revealed plans for a legal framework around the use of cryptocurrencies. A statement from Touadera’s chief of staff, Obed Namsio, said:  BREAKING – full text of the Law on cryptoassets in Central African Republic 🇨🇫 #Bitcoin @GloireKW 🙏 1/ #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/JJVC3tPmRl “The adoption of Bitcoin as official money represents a decisive step toward opening up new opportunities for our country.” According to the World Bank, the Central African Republic is one of the poorest countries in the world, and it has been in a state of insecurity and increasing violence for nine years. The government controls the capital, but much of the country is ruled by armed groups. Reports indicate that most officials and civil society groups, including Citizens Standing in Solidarity with the Central African Republic, have protested this law, saying it risks national sovereignty. The group said in a statement: “By imposing cryptocurrencies as a national currency, the power of Bangui has just sold off the little that remained of the authority of the State and its power to control its economy, and therefore its development.” The move by the country, which comes nearly eight months after the Central American government of El Salvador passed a similar law, makes the Central African Republic the first one in Africa to legalize the use of cryptocurrencies. Within those 12 months, Bitcoin has received criticism and profound market sentiments in equal measure across the globe that has dramatically influenced its value. Speaking to Bloomberg on the development, Finance Minister Herve Ndoba said last week: “There’s a common narrative that sub-Saharan African countries are often one step behind when it comes to adapting to new technology. We can say that our country is one step ahead this time.” While most countries haven’t come up with effective and efficient means of regulating the cryptocurrency space, there are still some concerns over the possibility of its being used for money laundering. Nonetheless, some financial experts have argued that the adoption and efficient regulation of cryptocurrency can significantly boost financial inclusion in developing countries."

World-renowned tennis star Serena Williams recently partnered with Block’s money transfer service Cash App to bring more financial services to women and people of color using Bitcoin. In a recent statement, the leading athlete has heaped praise on Bitcoin, the leader in the industry, calling it a “super strong investment.” According to the 23-time Grand Slam winner, the crypto world is constantly evolving, but this progress is led mainly by Bitcoin. Williams’ investment was made through her Serena Ventures firm. Lolli is at least the second crypto-related platform Williams has invested in; she unveiled in a 2019 Instagram post to have invested in cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. Block’s co-founder Jack Dorsey announced the tennis star’s entry into a deal with the firm during the Miami Bitcoin Conference. William herself stated that she hoped the initiative would include grand women and people of color additional access to Bitcoin’s opportunities. She stated:  “It’s important to expand Bitcoin to women and people of color.” ""It's all being led by #bitcoin"" — @serenawilliams pic.twitter.com/ALGJmDCHug In addition to that, in a viral Twitter clip, William has shown her belief in Bitcoin, which is the primary digital asset in word and deed. She explained:  “What’s interesting in Bitcoin is there is not going to be a ton available. I like looking at it like that and deciding: Okay, that is a super-strong investment in terms of all cryptocurrencies. There’s a lot happening in the cryptocurrency world, and obviously, I think it’s all being led by Bitcoin.” The tennis star and her husband, Alexis Ohanian, a co-founder of Reddit, recently invested $5 million in Bitcoin rewards company Lolli. The funding round, which included several other investors, will go toward developing Lolli’s mobile app, which lets users earn Bitcoin when they shop online at partnered retailers. Kroger, Best Buy, and Nike are among the 1,000 retailers to offer Bitcoin rewards for purchases on Lolli. Commenting on the investment, Williams said in a statement:  “I’m excited to announce my investment in Lolli, a company on a mission to make Bitcoin more accessible. Earning and owning Bitcoin is a step towards financial inclusivity for all people.” In a recent interview with Bloomberg Technology, Williams was asked to choose between BTC, ETH, or another cryptocurrency on the horizon. “I think there is something else on the horizon; a few that I know are on the horizon. I think Bitcoin has had an amazing boom, and it continues to do something amazing, and it’s huge.”"

Through automated clearing house (ACH) rails, Fiat currency will be automatically converted into Bitcoin. According to a report in Forbes, the firm announced as it unveiled a new suite of products affiliated with its debit card christened “Paid in Bitcoin” at Miami’s Bitcoin 2022 conference. U.S. customers of Cash App, a mobile payment service operated by Block (Formerly Square), will be able to invest their direct deposit paychecks into Bitcoin automatically. Cash App’s Bitcoin Product Lead Miles Suter stated:   “We’re starting to roll out ‘paid in Bitcoin […] As far as I know, this is the largest deployment of a feature like this to date… With two taps, you’ll be able to pick a percentage between one and 100, and boom, you’re done.”   While making the announcement, Suter revealed that users could convert any percentage from 1% to 100% of their direct deposits to be automatically converted into Bitcoin and adjusted, if needed, at any time. He further said that the goal of Cash App was to redefine the world’s relationship with money and Bitcoin, aiming to get Bitcoin in the hands of as many people as possible. Suter said:   “We believe that Bitcoin is the world’s best digital, sound money period […] we believe that Bitcoin is for the people and that in America, Cash App is the financial app for the people.” Cash App announced the integration of Lightning Network payments for users in February but will now let users receive Lightning Network transactions. Suter Added:   “To make Bitcoin even more universally accessible, we’re announcing Lightning receives […] in the coming months, you’ll be able to receive Bitcoin over the Lightning Network with no block confirmations needed […] this new feature furthers Cash App’s mission to make Bitcoin usable as a currency.”  The new service’s additional features include the option to round up to the nearest dollar any Cash Card transaction made on a Visa debit card connected to a Cash App balance and divert the spare change into BTC. Without providing any specific details, the firm used the conference to announce that tennis star Serena Williams would partner with the company. William’s decision to join Cash App comes on the heels of similar endorsements by many sports stars who have signed partnerships and endorsement deals with crypto firms. These include David Beckham with DigitalBits, Lionel Messi with Socios.com, Naomi Osaka, Tom Brady and Steph Curry with FTX, and LeBron James with Crypto.com. Cash App integrated Lightning Network in January, which paved the way for consumers to use Bitcoin at point-of-sale easily. This enables U.S. Cash App users to make faster BTC transactions across mainstream businesses. Cash App also remains a famous avenue for buying Bitcoin after it became the first public company to allow for Bitcoin purchases in 2018. "
2022-04-05 12:55:54+00:00,Scarcity Alert: 19 Millionth Bitcoin Mined,https://blockzeit.com/scarcity-alert-19-millionth-bitcoin-mined/,"Just released data shows the 19 millionth Bitcoin has just been mined, leaving less than two million BTC for miners to put into circulation as the Bitcoin network moves through a fixed issuance schedule until it reaches the 21 million supply limit and stops creating new Bitcoin. Forever. The watershed moment demonstrates how Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s creator, was able to combine decades of research in computer science to achieve programmable digital scarcity, a unique feature central to Bitcoin’s value proposition. Prior to Bitcoin, digital cash had the flaw of double spending. Before the advent of bitcoin and blockchain, the only way to ensure that a party did not spend money twice was through a central authority that had to keep track of coins being sent and received, updating users’ balances – much like the traditional financial system.  However, Nakamoto’s invention of Bitcoin, using the Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism in a distributed ledger known as a blockchain, enabled computers running a piece of software to enforce strict spending conditions that prevented a digital representation of value from being spent twice for the first time – or made it prohibitively expensive to do so. While miners and nodes collaborate to issue and validate Bitcoin transactions, investors seeking to acquire increasingly scarce BTC must bid their way through the asset’s limited supply. Previously, miners would sell their freshly minted Bitcoin on the market to cover operating expenses in US dollars; however, it is now common to see mining companies add their produced coins to their balance sheet and issue Bitcoin-backed loans as needed.  Bitcoin has thus become more scarce as a larger proportion of the total Bitcoin supply has been locked up for the long term. A miner currently earns 6.25 BTC for each block mined. Since Nakamoto mined the first one, which yielded a 50 BTC reward, the block reward has been cut in half every 210,000 blocks – roughly every four years. Each epoch, fewer new bitcoins are distributed, increasing the asset’s scarcity even further. As a result, even though mining 19 million bitcoins took roughly a dozen years, the remaining 2 million will not be minted until 2140 if the protocol remains unchanged. Surprisingly, the Bitcoin protocol’s supply cap of 21 million is not stated in its white paper or code. Rather, it is the ever-decreasing number of Bitcoin rewarded by each block, combined with the decentralized network of computers enforcing that reward, that allows the network to implicitly prevent the issuance of Bitcoin in excess of the limit. Bitcoin implementations control new issuance by ensuring that each new block does not create more than the allowed block subsidy. The distributed network of Bitcoin nodes can indirectly enforce the supply limit as the block reward approaches zero over the next century by ensuring that bitcoin cannot be spent twice and that the block reward does not yield more than it should at any given time. In addition to bringing scarcity to the digital realm, Bitcoin enables a predictable monetary policy that can be planned ahead of time, which differs from the current monetary system in which governments and policymakers can increase the issuance of money, as we’ve seen in recent years. Currency depreciation is impossible with Bitcoin, and its users’ purchasing power is safeguarded. Along with being a hedge against inflation, Bitcoin’s predictable policy allows users to plan for the future because they can be confident that no one will debase their money.  Given BTC’s scarcity, why has its price been trading in a range of $30,000 to $60,000 over the last year when many analysts predicted we’d see a $100,000 Bitcoin before the end of 2021. The price of Bitcoin in US dollars can be viewed as a lagging indicator of  the general public’s understanding of the technology and its innovative value proposition. Given the likelihood of further escalation of inflationary pressures in the near term, it is not unreasonable to expect the Bitcoin price to reach $100,000, which would represent only 17 percent of gold’s market value. In short, BTCs long-term upward indicators look solid. To date, only a small percentage of the global population truly understands the unique concepts of programmatically decentralized and scarce digital money.  And while the Bitcoin price may trend to infinity in the long term, that won’t likely become a reality until the majority of people – or the majority of the world’s capital – begins to understand that. This widespread epiphany seems to be spreading. According to data from the digital asset management firm CoinShares, Bitcoin adoption has been increasing at a 113 percent annual rate. (In the meantime, people are adopting the internet at a slower rate of 63 percent.) If people embrace Bitcoin at the same rate as they did the internet in its early days (or faster), the report claims that there will be 1 billion users by 2024 and 4 billion users by 2030. At that point, a sharp supply shock would ensue as an unlimited amount of money flows into a limited amount of BTC. As the supply of BTC continues to dwindle, a $100,000 coin price seems conservative. What are your thoughts on the 19 million Bitcoin mined  and the fact that only two million bitcoin remain to be extracted? Let us know in the comments below. This article is presented for educational and entertainment purposes only and is not an inducement or recommendation to invest in bitcoin. As always do your own research and never invest more than you can afford to lose. "

The Sydney-based payment systems provider will roll out new terminals that enable consumers to pay with crypto.   According to a report in The Australian, Australians will from next July pay using crypto at over 170 On-The-Run (OTR) convenience stores and service stations across South Australia. This will apply across the corporation’s group of companies’ point of sale merchant terminals in metropolitan Adelaide and regional Australia. Customers will be able to use digital assets in service stations, C Coffee dine-in and drive-through cafes, Subway, Oporto, and Wokinabox restaurants. South Australia's major service station chain On the Run (OTR) with around 170 stores will connect to https://t.co/7otzHh50mJ system to start accepting crypto payments from July This move will allow Customers pay for gas, snacks and even a subway train with over 30 cryptocurrency pic.twitter.com/VOzEYzbdIT The development results from a deal between Singapore-based crypto.com to implement a Pay Merchant service to create a payment settlement layer. A Sydney-based payment systems provider, Datamesh, will roll out point of sale terminals allowing shoppers to pay through the Crypto.com app with their cryptocurrency holdings. Peregrine’s executive chairman, Yasser Shahin, stated that accepting crypto payments was an opportunity to jump on board with the growth of cryptocurrencies. He stated:    “Australians will be able to pay using crypto at convenience stores and service stations in South Australia by the middle of this year, as private companies cautiously embrace digital currency payment capabilities.” The move by OTR follows research findings by payments company Worldpay from FIS that found 75% of Crypto.com customers were interested in purchasing goods or services with cryptocurrency in 2022, with retail one of the top two industry segments. A similar study commissioned by Australian cryptocurrency exchange Swyftx earlier this year found that most Australian business leaders want to see stronger regulation before exploring opportunities to integrate crypto into their business. Shahin opined that the move would enable the firm to become a leader in payment innovation. He added:  “Crypto.com is a world-changing platform. It is synonymous with the future of technology, payments, and business […]; we are excited that our collaboration with Crypto.com and DataMesh has enabled this capability, and I look forward to our customers embracing this innovative and convenient way to engage with us.” According to research, around 40% of customers globally are already paying using crypto, and the other 60% said they’re interested in paying with crypto within the next 12 months, of the industry sectors most willing to adopt cryptocurrencies, retail and grocery merchants tied with luxury goods providers, with 80% in each category enthusiastic about accepting crypto payments. The Australian government is also currently working on a robust cryptocurrency regulatory framework to overhaul the country’s payments system.  Meanwhile, in the United States, giant convenience store Sheetz last year also made it possible to pay with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and other cryptocurrencies in partnership with Gemini-backed startup Flexa. Last August, several cryptocurrency kiosk operators partnered with Circle K to install Bitcoin ATMs throughout New York."

The move comes as Dubai adopts a new law to regulate virtual assets. A school based in Dubai will begin later this year start accepting cryptocurrencies as a form of payment for tuition fees. According to a press release, parents of the UK-curriculum Citizens School that is scheduled to open in September this year will be allowed to pay fees in Bitcoin or Ethereum.   The school, which will be the first one in the Middle East to accept digital currency, said crypto would be accepted via a partnership with a cryptocurrency platform that will automatically convert them to UAE Dirhams. The school’s founder Dr. Adil Alzarooni said: “A while ago, cryptocurrency was only a floating term among well-versed investors. However, today cryptocurrency is becoming much more mainstream, reshaping the traditional financial system […] Citizens is disrupting the education sector by re-imagining every element of the learning experience – be it the way our children learn, how we equip our teachers to be mentors, what our learners choose to wear, or the ways that parents can pay for tuition.” The move comes when the Dubai government has just adopted its first law regulating virtual assets, ensuring a safe and advanced legal framework for investors. The school has said it acted in line with the nation’s goal to become a global hub for cryptocurrency as market capitalization hits $1.9 trillion. Apart from striving to help place the UAE at the center of the global digital economy, Citizens School aims to deliver growth aligned with the UAE Centennial 2071, mainly by providing an excellent education for a diversified knowledge economy. The school seeks to become an incubator for entrepreneurial ideas and children-led innovation. Hisham Hodroge, the chief executive of Citizens School, said:  “Introducing the ability to pay tuition fees through cryptocurrencies goes beyond just providing another payment option […] it is also a means to drive further interest in the applications of blockchain — a technology that Citizens School intends to deploy, in time, across several aspects of its academic and administrative operations.” The Citizens School has partnered with a leading group of schools in the United Kingdom to create the ‘Citizen’s Tapestry’. This refers to a schooling experience that centers on future-proofing students by equipping them with a rich, connected bank of knowledge and skills relevant to the 21st century through its custom-built curriculum. The curriculum is based on UK National Curriculum and enriched with six key threads – Minds. Alzarooni said: “By introducing this new payment facility, we look forward to enhancing the role of young generations in achieving the UAE’s digital economy. As more people embrace the era of digitalization, today’s children will become the entrepreneurs and investors of tomorrow.”"

Brazil’s second-largest city, Rio de Janeiro, announced plans to accept cryptocurrency payments for property taxes in 2023. A report in Bloomberg Linea cited a notice from the City Hall saying the city would contract multiple companies to handle the conversion of cryptocurrencies to Brazilian reals. Commenting on the initiative, Binance co-founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao stated on Twitter that his company had made a “handshake deal” towards initiating formal acceptance of Bitcoin in the city some time ago, a move that has now been formalized. Binance would now set up an office in the city in the future. 9 days ago, I made a handshake deal with mayor @eduardopaes. Rio De Janeiro will accept crypto for tax payments, and @Binance will open an office in Rio. He's done his part. We are working on ours. https://t.co/HPJONtBfQ8 Making the official announcement, a notice from the office of the Rio de Janeiro mayor added that the city also had plans to develop its collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that will feature images of Rio de Janeiro’s most famous tourist spots. According to Pedro Paulo, the city’s secretary of finance and planning, the goal is to stimulate tourism and incentivize local artists with the help of NFTs. Eduardo Paes, an official from the mayor’s office, said:   “To enable the operation, the municipality will hire companies specialized in converting crypto assets into reals (the Brazilian currency). In this way, the City Hall will receive 100% of the amount in the currency […] we will stimulate the circulation of cryptocurrencies by integrating them into the payment of taxes, as in the case of IPTU (the real estate tax in the city) and, in the future, this can be expanded to services such as taxi races, for example.” Work from anywhere = Rio! Welcome @binance… Rio on blockchain! @eduardopaes https://t.co/NJEArEvEXV Brazilian secretary Pedro Paulo further acknowledged that the city’s goal, besides the acceptance of cryptocurrencies, was to develop a solid market of this new asset class in the city, adding: “We will stimulate the circulation of cryptocurrencies by integrating them into the payment of taxes, as in the case of IPTU and, in the future, this can be expanded to services such as taxi races, for example.” Brazil is taking serious steps towards cryptocurrency adoption, and the decision by Binance to open shop in Rio de Janeiro took shape after Paes gave Zhao a key to the city. There has been growing crypto interest in the area following El Salvador’s decision to make Bitcoin legal tender in September 2021. The Latin American region was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, and there’s now fear of a looming debt crisis.  The authorities in Panama, Paraguay, Argentina, and Mexico are now more open to Bitcoin and are currently seeking a more significant role for the flagship cryptocurrency in their economies. These countries can reap unprecedented benefits from embracing crypto. For instance, in El Salvador, the tourism industry has enjoyed a 30% growth since the country formally adopted BTC as legal tender."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."

The bills seek to study his Bitcoin law’s detrimental effects on the U.S. dollar. The full United States Senate is set to vote on a bill that seeks to mitigate risks to America’s financial system from El Salvador’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. The “Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador (ACES) Act” was introduced by Sens. James Risch (R-Idaho), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) on February 16 has already passed out of the committee stage.  Risch explained in a statement on Wednesday that the legislation would require the State and Treasury Departments, among other federal agencies, to mitigate risks such as potential empowerment of China and organized criminal organizations. Risch said:  “As El Salvador has adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, it’s important we understand and mitigate potential risks to the U.S. financial system.”  Expressing shock over the bill, Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele said via Twitter:  “Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that the U.S. Government would be afraid of what we are doing here.” Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that the US Government would be afraid of what we are doing here. pic.twitter.com/QgJPa70mn0 El Salvador became the first country globally to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021. It went on to launch a government-backed crypto wallet besides offering incentives for Bitcoin usage. Salvadoran President Bukele also announced the country would raise $1 billion through Bitcoin-backed bond issuance. However, this has been delayed from its initial planned launch of mid-March. Many U.S. politicians, including Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton, have consistently warned about Bitcoin’s threat to the USD’s global supremacy. The chickens seem to have come home to roost following Russia and Ukraine’s conflict. Its economic fallout has frequent conversation begun about the dollar’s weakness, and Bitcoin’s strength, in these conditions. Whether the U.S.’s move is a coincidence or not remains to be seen. Still, rumors are swirling around that several other countries are also considering adopting Bitcoin cryptocurrency alongside El Salvador. This could explain President Biden’s administration’s “urgency” in researching the development of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in his recent executive order.  El Salvador has received criticism from groups like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for months about Bitcoin. However, President Bukele has consistently defied such detractors and maintained his bullish enthusiasm. While the bill by the U.S. Senate doesn’t explicitly state fear, it reflects newfound wariness among politicians about how influential cryptocurrencies may be upon the world. One of the stipulations within section 2 calls to examine the “potential for reduced use by El Salvador of the United States dollar” in light of the Bitcoin law."
2022-03-22 04:54:04+00:00,Tennis Star Naomi Osaka Partners with FTX to Bring More Women into Crypto,https://blockzeit.com/tennis-star-naomi-osaka-partners-with-ftx-to-bring-more-women-into-crypto/,"Osaka signed a long-term deal with crypto trading firm FTX to become the platform’s latest ambassador. The focus is on appealing to women and “further democratizing the space.” The ongoing dwindling prices for the major cryptocurrencies haven’t stopped the leading crypto trading firms from seeking sports celebrity endorsements to coax people to sign on and invest. Tennis superstar Naomi Osaka becomes the latest crypto ambassador inking a deal with crypto exchange FTX.  The four-time Grand Slam winner signed a long-term partnership agreement with FTX, as part of which Osaka will be focused on bringing women onto its crypto platform and will play an active role in directing and producing content. As per the deal, she will wear the company’s logo during her competitions, beginning with the Miami Open this week. Osaka explained:  “Cryptocurrencies started with the goal of being accessible to everyone and breaking down barriers to entry. I’m excited to partner with FTX to get back to that mission and innovate on new ways to reach more people and democratize the space.” What makes the latest celebrity deal unique is the fact that FTX and Osaka are hoping to reach young women. The firm said that Osaka would produce content that “will focus on bringing women onto the platform and into the future of Web3.” Osaka will receive an equity stake in FTX Trading and be paid in crypto as part of the partnership. The company said in a statement:  “We have seen the statistics about how few women are part of crypto by comparison, which kind of mirrors the inequality we see in other financial markets.” For a long time now, cryptocurrency firms have focused on celebrity ambassadors, and advertising campaigns focused on men or w general broad audience. FTX has in the past used Larry David in its Super Bowl advert besides signing Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen as brand ambassadors. Brady took the lead in advertising while Matt Damon led an advert for Crypto.com. Osaka’s deal is a game-changer as it’s the first one explicitly targeting women.  This will be significant because women make up less of the crypto space than men. The statistics are skewed towards men whether you’re looking at conference speakers, crypto company founders, or NFT artists. For example, women account for under 5% of all crypto company founders, according to one 2021 survey of 121 founders. Female artists also accounted for only 5% of all NFT artists, according to a survey published by Art Tactic in November 2021. And while 92% of women report having heard of crypto, only 24% report owning it."

The Deputy minister Zahidi Zainul Abidin told Parliament on Monday, March 21, in reply to a supplementary question from Syed Ibrahim Syed Noh (Ledang-PH) on the government’s stand on trading on NFT platforms which are becoming more popular, especially among the younger generation. Comms Ministry in Malaysia proposes adopting cryptocurrency as legal tender ""to help the younger generation who are active users of the currency, especially on non-fungible token (NFT) trading platforms""https://t.co/m4vXcsfMRr According to the report on Bloomberg, the Deputy Minister said the ministry would look into ways to increase the youth’s involvement in digital currencies as it is the future of finance. He stated:  “We hope the government can allow and legalize this to increase the youth’s uptake of cryptocurrencies […]; we are trying to see how we can legalize this so that we can develop youth participation in crypto and assist them.” According to publication Focus Malaysia, cryptocurrency adoption is on the rise in the country, with digital asset ownership being well above the global average of 15.5%, thus ranking it seventh out of the 27 countries included in the Finder’s latest Cryptocurrency Adoption Index. The crypto ownership rate in Malaysia is 19.9% as of end-December 2021, ahead of Russia (19.6%) and Ghana (17.3%). Vietnam had the highest rate of cryptocurrency ownership globally, with 28.6% of its online population saying they own a cryptocurrency, followed by India (23.4%) and Australia (22.9%). Bitcoin is Malaysia’s most popular cryptocurrency, with 34.9% of Malaysian crypto owners owning the coin. The second most popular coin is Ripple at 23.1%, while Ethereum is third at 20.5%. According to cryptocurrency editor at Finder.com Keegan Francis, crypto awareness is relatively high among Malaysians compared to their global counterparts. He stated:  “It’s not surprising crypto adoption is on the rise in Malaysia given general awareness is quite high with 63% of Malaysian adults knowing what cryptocurrency is […] 61% of Malaysian adults think that cryptocurrency is a good investment, well above the global average of 43% and ahead of Vietnam (59%), Hong Kong (42%) and Singapore (37%).” A recent report by Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange App Crypto.com showed at least 300 million cryptocurrency owners globally as of January 2022. The report titled “2021 Crypto Market Sizing Report & 2022 Forecast” noted that it expected global crypto owners to reach one billion by the end-2022. The report said the global crypto population increased by 178% in 2021, rising from 106 million in January to 295 million in December. Adding that crypto adoption was remarkable in the first half of 2021, the report highlighted:  “Heavyweight institutions, such as Tesla and Mastercard, took steps to embrace cryptocurrency […] in the second half of 2021, traction slowed, while adoption rates were maintained well above the previous year’s benchmark. In summary, crypto adoption continued to grow sustainably throughout 2021.”"

According to a recent press release by Sberbank, the move is expected to open new opportunities for the bank as it seeks to blunt the effects of sanctions by Western nations. The decision comes only two weeks after the Central Bank reiterated its position banning the issuance, mining, and circulation of cryptocurrencies in Russia. According to the report, the banks stated:  “Inclusion in the registry allows companies to issue digital financial assets and exchange them between users within their platforms.” Sberbank, which is Russia’s largest retail bank, recently announced it was withdrawing from the European market as sanctions due to the Ukrainian invasion started hitting Russian industries while its Europe-based units were seeing cash outflows. As a state-owned bank, Sberbank has been targeted by sanctions, such as those imposed by the United States Treasury, since the Russia–Ukraine War. The bank had in January 2022 applied for a license with Russia’s central bank to issue its digital token for corporate clients. Sberbank sought to have the digital asset available for the companies banking with it. The bank’s blockchain platform is based on distributed ledger technology, which can, theoretically, protect against information tampering. Sberbank said it would use blockchain technology that guarantees the safety of digital transactions and would allow companies to issue their digital assets, purchase those issued within Sberbank’s system, and make other transactions. According to the bank’s plan, its legal entities will soon be able to issue digital financial statements certifying monetary claims, acquire digital assets allocated in Sberbank’s system, and conduct crypto transactions. Sberbank’s director of the transactional business division Sergey Popov made the following remarks regarding the new development:  “While we are still at the beginning of working with digital assets, we realize that further development is necessary to adapt to the existing regulatory framework. We are ready to work closely with the regulator and executive authorities regarding this direction.” The law “On Digital Financial Assets,” which went into force in January 2021, regulated several crypto-related activities, including issuing digital coins and fundraising through tokens. However, it did not introduce rules for other critical operations with cryptocurrencies, such as their mining, trading, and circulation in the Russian economy. A working group at the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, has been preparing proposals to address the regulatory gaps. In February, the Ministry of Finance submitted a new draft law, “On Digital Currency,” which aims to legalize crypto investments and cement a ban on the use of cryptocurrencies for payments in Russia."
2022-03-17 05:23:18+00:00,Ukraine’s President Zelensky Signs Law Officially Legalizing Cryptocurrencies,https://blockzeit.com/ukraines-president-zelensky-signs-law-officially-legalizing-cryptocurrencies/,"Ukraine has formally legalized Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies after receiving over $100 million in crypto donations during its war with Russia. Ukraine’s leader President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed a bill that officially makes cryptocurrencies legal in his besieged country. According to an official statement published by the Ministry of Digital Transformation, the new law allows foreign and Ukrainian crypto exchanges to operate legally in Ukraine in what is being seen as a vital step to developing a legal market for virtual assets in the country.  The law also creates a regulatory framework for an open crypto market in Ukraine for the first time. The law states:  “The signing of this law by the president is another important step towards bringing the crypto sector out of the shadows and launching a legal market for virtual assets in Ukraine.” Even though cryptocurrencies haven’t technically been illegal in Ukraine, digital assets have operated in what you could call a gray area. The country has received over $100 million in crypto donations from the global community during its ongoing war with Russia, leading to its official adoption of crypto assets.  Before enacting the law, neither companies nor individuals could own or trade cryptocurrencies in the market. A recent surge in crypto crime and money laundering in Ukraine and Eastern Europe in recent years led to the nation’s government cracking down on the industry. The new law sets forth a legal framework for Ukraine’s burgeoning crypto industry. It taps the National Bank of Ukraine and its National Commission on Securities and Stock Market to serve as regulators. It also paves the way for more laws and a tax code on crypto, which, hopefully, will further legitimize the crypto industry in Ukraine. Ukraine has legalized the crypto sector — @ZelenskyyUa signed a law. From now on foreign and Ukrainian cryptocurrencies exchanges will operate legally and banks will open accounts for crypto companies. It is an important step towards the development of the VA market in Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/lqqO1J9r1k The digital ministry said via Twitter that Ukraine’s National Commission would regulate the market on Securities and the Stock Market. Exchanges will be able to operate legally, and banks will open accounts for them. According to a February 17 announcement by the government, the ministry was tasked with:  “Shaping and pursuing a policy in the field of virtual assets; determining the order of circulation of virtual assets; issuing permits to virtual asset service providers; and carrying out supervision and financial monitoring in this area.” Ukraine is currently among the top 5 countries globally for cryptocurrency usage, making the law’s approval somewhat overdue. Ukraine’s initiative comes soon after Dubai established its Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority and US President Joe Biden signed an Executive Order on crypto industry oversight. There has been fear that crypto could weaken the West’s economic punishment against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine last month. On the contrary, cryptocurrencies have been overwhelmingly beneficial to Ukraine during the conflict, with the nation receiving over $100 million in crypto donations in less than a month. The country is even preparing to launch an NFT collection about the Russian war following a canceled airdrop."
2022-03-15 06:33:52+00:00,Argentinians Irked by IMF Calls to Slow Down Crypto Adoption in the Country,https://blockzeit.com/argentinians-irked-by-imf-calls-to-slow-down-crypto-adoption-in-the-country/,"Cryptocurrency enthusiasts in Argentina are up in arms in what appears to be an anti-cryptocurrency requirement in a deal their government made with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). According to the citizens of the populous South American country, the agreement that restructures the repayment of the $45 billion the government owes the IMF also contains hints at a series of measures directed at stifling the growth that the crypto industry has experienced in the country. Argentinians who criticized a perceived anti-crypto requirement in the newly-approved deal their government signed with the IMF signal said establishing regulations and measures could slow the growth of cryptocurrency adoption in the country. The statement that slipped into the law project that approves the refinancing mentioned above of the debt declares: “The National Government, for a better safeguard of financial stability, will discourage the use of cryptocurrencies in the prevention of money laundering and informality. Likewise, the digitization of payments will have official incentives, and additional protection will be given to the financial consumer.” There’s already a bad feeling within the Argentine crypto community as they seek to understand better the proposed law’s potential impact and how it could affect the players in the crypto sphere. However, most of them still agree that a deficit of information prevents them from thoroughly examining the impact of the claim on actual encryption usage, which has recently reached record levels. Bitcoin Argentina, a non-profit organization whose purpose is to incentivize the use and understating of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, recently asked the government through a letter to provide it with all data related to these new measures aimed at slowing the adoption of cryptocurrencies in the country. Javier Madariaga, the executive director of the NGO Bitcoin Argentina, stated: “We are not making this request for access to public information to hinder or affect the negotiation that the government is currently carrying out with the IMF, but rather so that the community can learn in detail the arguments and policies that they want to carry out in around crypto assets […] to contribute to a healthy growth of the ecosystem and the crypto industry.”  Others like Franco Bianchi, CMO of Lemon, an Argentine startup that provides cryptocurrency payment solutions, have directly criticized the protocol indirectly, making statements supporting cryptocurrency adoption. Another prominent Bitcoiner, Franco Amati, said he suspected it might have been intended to stifle a potential Bitcoin financing effort, such as El Salvador is adopting. Madariaga added:  “We are convinced that the path is not disincentives or prohibition, but to work in a coordinated manner with the private and public sectors to take advantage of the potential of decentralized finance […] we are concerned that the authorities are agreeing to discourage a technology that has already been massively adopted by the population itself rather than unleashing its potential to address historical problems.”"

The council members had 32 members voted against, and 23 voted in favor of the ban, while six committee members abstained. According to Patrick Hansen, head of strategy at Unstoppable Finance, the committee has voted against the proposed proof-of-work (POW) ban. He explained in a series of tweets Monday: “The ECON committee of the EU Parliament just voted against the de-facto POW-ban … Big relief & political success for the Bitcoin & crypto community in the EU.” BREAKING: The ECON committee of the EU Parliament just voted against the de-facto POW-ban: 32 against, 24 in favor.Big relief & political success for the bitcoin & crypto community in the EU💪💪Will share a breakdown of the vote and what’s next here in this thread. #Bitcoin The provision, which was added to the draft last week, sought to limit the use of cryptocurrencies powered by an energy-intensive computing process known as proof-of-work across the EU’s 27 member states. The proposal met with a heavy backlash from crypto advocates worldwide. Stefan Berger, a member of the EU Parliament and rapporteur of MiCA, tweeted the success: “First-stage win at #MiCA in committee! By accepting my proposal, members have paved the way for future-oriented crypto regulation. It is now a matter of accepting the report as a whole in the final vote & sending out a strong signal for innovation.” Erster Etappensieg bei #MiCA im Ausschuss! Mit der Annahme meines Vorschlags haben die Mitglieder den Weg geebnet für eine zukunftsorientierte Krypto-Regulierung. Nun gilt es, den Bericht auch als Ganzes in Schlussabstimmung anzunehmen & starkes Signal für Innovation zu setzen. The effect of the outcome for the Proof-of-Work crypto mining mechanism is that while mining will most likely no longer be included in Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), the EU will add it to its sustainable finance taxonomy. The regulation proposes an overarching legal framework for assets, markets, and service providers. All of these elements are currently not regulated at the EU level. As per the European Union, MiCA aims to:  “Harmonize the European framework for the issuance and trading of different types of cryptocurrency tokens as part of a European digital financing strategy.”  MiCA, which stands for “Markets in Crypto Assets,” is a branch of the European Commission established in September 2020. The MiCA is responsible for developing and implementing regulations related to Digital Finance across Europe in this digital era. MiCA seeks to go hand-in-hand with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws and strengthens financial safety and investors’ protection in Europe. There are talks that Joe Biden also wants to regulate cryptocurrencies positively. A recent article spoke about how he tried to push digital regulations relating to cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, the announcement did not have any details yet.“Although his intentions were different than a Swiss psychoanalyst’s, Joe Biden set off a similar exercise in the financial world this week when he issued a long-awaited executive order on digital assets that somehow managed to elicit a positive response in the cryptocurrency community.”"

The decision backtracks a 2018 decision to stop supporting Bitcoin due to the network’s slow transaction speeds and fees at the time. Financial services company Stripe has announced its re-entry into the crypto sphere. The global payments giant announced a suite of products, offering businesses tools and APIs that make it easier for customers to buy and store crypto tokens, cash out, trade NFTs and handle compliance workflows like Know Your Customer (KYC).  As per the announcement, the company’s products will enable support for users to buy and sell over 135 cryptocurrencies with fiat currencies in at least 180 countries. Stripe co-founder John Collison announced via Twitter and shared different ways the firm plans to support Web3 companies via its crypt APIs.  Stripe now supports crypto businesses: exchanges, on-ramps, wallets, and NFT marketplaces.

Currently, Stripe’s crypto services are only available to businesses in the U.S., the U.K., and the European Union. Its NFT services for marketplaces are supported in these regions and Japan. Commenting about the new deal, FTX’s Head of Strategy, Tristan Yver, said the partnership would help the firm attract a wider mainstream audience by making the process of acquiring digital assets simpler. He stated:  “The optimizations we made in our payments setup with Stripe deliver the smooth on-ramp experience FTX’s growing customer base demands. We’re able to multiply revenue by making it easier than ever for people to invest in crypto.” A company with a similar name, Strike, quickly filled in the gap Stripe also announced launching an open drop NFT collectibles christened “Cube Thingies” via Nifty Gateway as part of the initiative. It will cost users between $242.42 and $424.24 to mint each of the NFTs, and all proceeds from the sale will go to non-profit healthcare tech organization Watsi.

Here’s what industry insiders have to say about it. For years, the crypto industry has pleaded with the US federal government to coordinate its efforts on crypto policy, fed up with what it sees as enforcement-based regulation. President Biden took a step in that direction today by signing the Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets. The stated goals of the order are to find ways to reduce risks to both individual consumers and the global financial system, as well as to prevent cryptocurrency’s “misuse” for criminal purposes, all while cementing the United States’ role as a leader in technological innovation so that Americans who are “underserved by the traditional banking system” can gain more financial access. The bill mandates that an alphabet soup of agencies report back to the president on a variety of issues within three to seven months. Intelligence, State Department, and Treasury officials, for example, have 90 days to return a strategy for limiting the use of cryptocurrency in illicit and terrorist financing. The SEC, the FTC, and the CFTC, as well as other government banking bodies, will have 180 days to produce a report recommending consumer protection issues. In short, it’s laying the groundwork for the kind of comprehensive regulations that industry actors have both requested and feared if they don’t get their way. The CEO of USDC stablecoin issuer Circle, Jeremy Allaire, says the White House’s decision to use a “whole-of-government approach to simultaneously harness opportunities while controlling and mitigating inherent risks in responsible innovation is encouraging.” He says Circle, which advocated for such an approach, is confident that policymakers will walk away from the review process with a solid understanding of the opportunities that crypto presents. The order, according to Denelle Dixon, CEO of Stellar Development, “recognizes the need for clarity so the industry can continue to evolve, grow, and meet the ever-increasing enthusiasm and momentum we see for the sector.” “We were fearing a heavier hand, and possibly some tougher proclamations,” says Blockchain Association Head of Governmental Relations Dave Grimaldi, “but for an emerging industry, this is a sensible step toward protection, law enforcement, and education.” According to Coin Center Executive Director Jerry Brito, the order “stands in stark contrast” to recent hot takes by politicians and media members on the dangers of cryptocurrency, whether that be destroying the environment or theoretically assisting Russia in evading sanctions: “The [executive order] is just more evidence that when serious officials take a sober look at crypto, the reaction is not to light their hair on fire, but rather to recognize it as an innovation that the United States will want to foster and lead while mitigating obvious risks.” 1.9 trillion dollars That is the value of the world’s cryptocurrencies as of March 9th, down roughly 36% from an all-time high of more than $3 trillion in November, but up a staggering 630% in the last two years. Erik Voorhees, a staunch libertarian and the founder of cryptocurrency platform ShapeShift, dismissed Biden’s actions as “more of the same”: “The crypto Executive Order basically says ‘we’re going to look into this stuff’ (as if they haven’t for years) and then lists a bunch of platitudes about balancing innovation with financial system protection.” According to Human Rights Foundation CSO Alex Gladstein, the order is “heavy on CBDCs” and “doesn’t mention Bitcoin.” Gladstein sees Bitcoin as a critical tool for spreading human rights, whereas he sees central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) like the one being tested in China as potential vectors for financial surveillance. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), a vocal supporter of Bitcoin, adds that she is “unconvinced on the need for a central bank digital currency” but “will continue to closely monitor the Federal Reserve’s work in this area.” There are those hoping that the executive order will have unintended consequences. According to Messari founder Ryan Selkis, the order may provide President Biden with an opportunity to “look at the failures of the SEC in protecting investors, promoting fair crypto markets in the US, and promoting capital formation”—the very objectives the executive order lays out. According to the executive order, the Treasury will team up with other agencies to create a report on the future of money and payment systems."
2022-03-07 11:33:18+00:00,"Bitcoin in Sharp Focus as Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal Suspend Russia Operations over Ukraine",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-in-sharp-focus-as-visa-mastercard-and-paypal-suspend-russia-operations-over-ukraine/,"There’s a bigger earthquake in Russia than SWIFT as the significant payment processors PayPal, Visa and Mastercard blocked Russia, citing the recent invasion of Ukraine. All the payment processors announced the move on Saturday. The escalating economic sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have placed Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general in the global spotlight once again. This follows announcements by PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard that they were suspending their operations in Russia, citing its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Visa said in a press statement it would begin the process of discontinuing transactions in Russia but said the process would take several days. On the other hand, MasterCard announced in a press release it was suspending its network services in Russia, which sent military forces into Ukraine at the end of February. Visa’s global communications vice president Andy Gerlt said:  “Once complete, all transactions initiated with Visa cards issued in Russia will no longer work outside the country, and any Visa cards issued by financial institutions outside of Russia will no longer work within the Russian Federation.” Visa chairman and CEO Al Kelly similarly stated in the press release:  “The company was compelled to act following Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed. We regret the impact this will have on our valued colleagues and the clients, partners, merchants, and cardholders we serve in Russia. This war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values.” Taking a similar route, MasterCard announced that besides blocking some Russian financial institutions, the payment processor ended support for any cards issued by Russian banks and blocked transactions from cards issued outside Russia but used “at Russian merchants or ATMs.” Earlier on Saturday, Ukrainian vice-Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced via Twitter a letter sent by PayPal CEO Dan Schulman informing a similar shutdown. A PayPal spokesperson told Reuters the shutdown would still “ensure that account balances are dispersed in line with applicable laws.” PayPal chief executive Dan Schulman stated: We received a letter from @Dan_Schulman, CEO PayPal. So now it’s official: PayPal shuts down its services in Russia citing Ukraine aggression. Thank you @PayPal for your supporting! Hope that soon you will open it in for 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/RaJxEMSLQe “PayPal supports the Ukrainian people and stands with the international community in condemning Russia’s violent military aggression in Ukraine.” As major financial institutions disconnect Russia from the West through the primary payment links, it is expected that more retailers will turn to the cryptocurrency market due to its indiscriminate nature. A report by Chainalysis shows that trading between Russia’s ruble and cryptocurrencies experienced a sharp uptick. This indicates that more people are using crypto assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT to make international payments. As Russian peoples and companies look for alternatives and cryptocurrencies remain in sharp focus, the Central Bank of Russia maintains that Russians shouldn’t have anything to do with digital assets. As a result, more shockwaves are expected to be felt in the cryptocurrency market in the coming weeks or even the next few years. Tech lawyer Preston Byrne posted to Twitter:  “[The Visa and Mastercard shutdown] is a bigger earthquake than SWIFT […] trillions of dollars are going to be made building a mirror system that doesn’t respond to American pressure.”"
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2022-03-06 05:23:23+00:00,Putin Can’t Escape Sanctions With Crypto,https://blockzeit.com/putin-cant-escape-sanctions-with-crypto/,"What most people don’t realize is that crypto, be it Bitcoin or Ethereum, is a terrible tool for evading sanctions and hiding money. In direct response to Russia’s horrific invasion of Ukraine, the United States has imposed harsh economic sanctions on the Russian government (including President Vladimir Putin), oligarchs in Putin’s circle, and Russian businesses closely associated with the Kremlin. However, shortly after these sanctions were announced, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) retweeted a New York Times article claiming that cryptocurrencies could be used to circumvent US sanctions.  After which, in a letter to the Treasury Secretary on March 2, Warren called for increased “scrutiny” of digital assets, joining those who claim crypto and decentralized finance provide Putin with a way around US sanctions. Sanctions restrict U.S. citizens’ ability to transact with sanctioned individuals or businesses. Evasion does not refer to a sanctioned individual’s ability to own an asset, but rather to U.S. individuals who violate their obligation not to transact with or facilitate transactions with sanctioned individuals and entities.  To be used as a tool for sanctions evasion, digital assets must allow US citizens to transact with sanctioned entities without incurring consequences or exposing their activity to law enforcement. That is exactly what digital assets do not do. In fact, when compared to traditional financial markets, digital assets are uniquely ill-suited for sanctions evasion due to all of the ways that digital assets can improve sanctions compliance. Despite ongoing efforts and intense scrutiny, the traditional financial system has never come close to completely prohibiting the use of financial services by illicit actors. According to estimates by the US government and others, the illicit economy is massive, totaling well over a trillion dollars and dwarfing the amount of illicit financial activity actually disrupted by law enforcement. Yes, cryptocurrencies can be used for illegal financial activity, such as sanction evasion. However, digital assets are more difficult to exploit for illicit purposes at scale than the traditional ecosystem. Why is this the case? The answer is related to how transaction information in peer-to-peer digital asset transactions is stored. Transparent blockchains, in particular, create a permanent and immutable record of transactions. There are numerous examples of how this transparency misleads criminals. In recent weeks, two of the largest cryptocurrency hacks in history, the Bitfinex hack and The DAO hack, have been solved by analyzing on-chain data.  Those hacks happened years ago, and the data needed to track down the hackers has been publicly available to law enforcement—and anyone else with an internet connection—ever since. Furthermore, software tools for analyzing this massive amount of on-chain data are becoming increasingly sophisticated. These tools are already being used by cryptocurrency businesses, as is the Department of Justice, which recently announced the formation of a cryptocurrency enforcement unit. The government is already on the lookout for crypto-based illicit financial activity, including sanctions evasion, and has become quite adept at doing so. To summarize, sanctions compliance is alive and well in the cryptocurrency world. If Senator Warren and other Congressional leaders are truly concerned about cryptocurrency facilitating large-scale sanctions evasion, there are steps they can take to prevent this from becoming a reality. The most important of these is ensuring that crypto networks and decentralized finance can flourish in the United States. This will provide the best opportunity for the US government and law enforcement to develop and implement the most effective sanctions compliance tools in digital asset markets, as well as foster collaboration between digital asset market participants and US law enforcement. Congressional leaders should stop speculating without evidence about how criminals could use cryptocurrencies to avoid US sanctions and instead express their support for the crypto industry’s already extensive sanctions compliance efforts and help to improve them."
2022-03-03 05:28:44+00:00,Citadel Boss Ken Griffin Confesses Being Wrong about Crypto and Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/citadel-boss-ken-griffin-confesses-being-wrong-about-crypto-and-bitcoin/,"The famous billionaire hedge fund manager has been among the fiercest critic of cryptocurrencies. Griffin now seems to have a change of heart and now believes the crypto space has some merits.   The sentiments of the founder and CEO of Citadel LLC, Ken Griffin, are pointing to the possibility of the American market maker entering the crypto sphere later this year. In what is a serious change of heart, Griffin, who has been one of the harshest critics of the crypto industry, has finally admitted being wrong about the emerging asset class – he now believes in its merits.  The Citadel founder, speaking on Bloomberg Wealth with David Rubenstein on the current state of markets in light of recent geopolitical conflicts, stated that they are at a “very volatile inflection point.” Griffin, who had previously warned the younger generation to keep off the digital assets saying “there was no need for cryptocurrencies,” told the interviewer when asked about crypto:  “It’s fair to assume that over the months to come, you will see us engage in making markets in cryptocurrencies.” Griffin further stated that crypto had been “one of the great stories in finance over the last years. Griffin was highly skeptical as recently as November 2021, saying at the time that people are focused on new ideas and that he worried “that some of this passion is misplaced when it comes to cryptocurrencies.” With crypto’s current market capitalization of the asset class at almost $2 trillion, Griffin admitted not being “right on this call.” He stated:  “And I’ll be clear; I’ve been in the naysayer camp over that period of time. But the crypto market today has a market capitalization of about $2 trillion in round numbers, which tells you that I haven’t been right on this call.” While admitting he still harbored some doubts about some aspects of the industry, Griffin said his company was still keen on entering the crypto space. Prodded further, the Citadel boss opined that he believed many more businesses would open their arms toward cryptocurrencies in the coming months. He explained:  “I still have my skepticism, but there are hundreds and millions of people in this world today who disagree with that. To the extent that we’re trying to help institutions and investors solve their portfolio allocation problems, we have to give serious consideration to being a market maker in crypto.” The latest comments by Griffin are a U-turn from his earlier position about cryptocurrencies. In 2017, Griffin compared digital assets to the tulip bulb mania. The tulip bulb mania refers to an event in Holland in the 1600s where the contract prices for bulbs of the recently introduced tulip reached unbelievably high levels. Griffin had started back then when BTC was trading at $10,000:   “Bitcoin right now has many of the elements of the tulip bulb mania we saw back hundreds of years ago in Holland […] these bubbles tend to end in tears. And I worry about how this bubble might end.” Ken Griffin has officially confirmed that Citadel will start making markets in crypto in the coming months.Eventually they all capitulate. This conversion of Griffin to cryptocurrency has, as expected, earned a great deal of commentary on social networks, at a time when Bitcoin joined the list of top 15 most valuable currencies in the world. Crypto influencer and Bitcoin investor Anthony Pompliano on Twitter: “Eventually they all capitulate.”"
2022-03-02 09:19:33+00:00,Crypto Donations Flooding Ukraine,https://blockzeit.com/crypto-donations-flooding-ukraine/,"Uniswap, a leading DEX, has created an interface that allows users to exchange any ERC-20 token for Ethereum and donate it to the Ukrainian government in a single transaction. “We built an interface that swaps any token for ETH and then sends it directly to the Ukrainian government in a single transaction to ensure that everyone who wants to donate ERC-20 tokens to the Ukrainian government can do so,” Uniswap tweeted. The protocol interface was designed so that “anyone who wants to donate but holds other ERC-20 tokens can do so with one click.” Cryptocurrency is now a more mainstream part of the global financial system, which means that it is inevitably a part of international conflict, for better or worse. This is evident as Russian forces invade Ukraine. Millions of dollars in cryptocurrency have been sent to Ukraine’s army and hacktivist groups. Even the Ukrainian government is now accepting cryptocurrency donations and has already raised more than $15 million.  Some Ukrainians are also turning to cryptocurrency as a substitute for Ukrainian financial institutions, which are restricting access to bank accounts and foreign currency.  In a situation where governments are in disarray, it is difficult to rely on traditional banks, and there is apprehension about surveillance. As a result, a relatively anonymous system with no government involvement is appealing. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency were donated to the Ukrainian government and non-governmental organizations. Earlier this week, the Ukrainian government released a Bitcoin and Ethereum donation address; blockchain records show that these addresses have received more than $8 million and $7 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively. The Ukrainian government announced earlier on Twitter that it was now accepting Polkadot donations as well, with “more cryptocurrencies” to follow. Elliptic, a blockchain analytics firm, indicated the total amount of cryptocurrency donations sent to the Ukrainian government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) surpassed $20 million yesterday. A fundraiser called Support Ukrainian Sovereignty claims to have raised $511,000 to date, in addition to donations sent directly to Ukrainian government addresses. The Ukrainian government also announced that it is now accepting Polkadot cryptocurrency donations in addition to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT donations. “The people of Ukraine are grateful for the global crypto community’s support and donations as we fight for our freedom.” “We are now accepting Polkadot donations as well,” said the government’s official Twitter account earlier today. Polkadot founder Gavin Wood responded to the Ukrainian government’s initial appeal for donations on February 27 by saying he would donate $5 million if the Ukrainian government began accepting Polkadot. Wood was chastised at the time for not simply donating funds in the cryptocurrencies that the government accepted at the time. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies have been donated to the Ukrainian government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) assisting in the country’s defense. According to Elliptic, Ukraine’s crypto crowdfunding effort surpassed $20 million on February 27th. This could be a seminal moment as the Western world unites against the naked aggression of Russia by embracing and using cryptocurrency to defend Ukraine. What better use case could there be than helping a population under attack by a brutal and repressive regime? For the time being, we can’t fathom how crypto will influence international conflict, or whether it will ultimately help or harm. People fleeing war zones may find a unique use for cryptocurrency, but they must first learn how to use it. There are already numerous other methods of raising and moving money that do not involve digital currencies. And, while cryptocurrency may make it easier to avoid sanctions, countries were evading sanctions long before bitcoin. What we do know is that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are now a real factor in global economies and conflicts around the world. Whether it’s good or bad in wartime, crypto is doing what its supporters claim it does — providing a way for people to work outside of traditional financial institutions — and there’s no sign that this will change anytime soon."
2022-02-23 05:18:46+00:00,El Salvador Bitcoin Experiment Grows Tourism Sector by 30%,https://blockzeit.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-experiment-grows-tourism-sector-by-30/,"The tourism minister says Bitcoin adoption has made the country a more attractive tourist destination. The Salvadoran President had previously announced that the country’s GDP grew over 10% in 2021.  The decision in September 2021 by El Salvador to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender has produced a positive impact not only on the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) but the local tourist industry as well. The report by Salvadoran tourism minister Morena Valdez says the industry surged over 30% since BTC’s adoption last year. Speaking during an interview with local news agency El Salvador News English, Valdez said:  Boom! 💥 💥 💥 El Salvador’s tourism has grown by 30% since the Bitcoin Lawhttps://t.co/i8t6JRHD1a#ElSalvador #BitcoinLaw #bitcoin #bitcoininvestment #Abtc #tourism #BitcoinCity #blockchain #investments “We did a poll to check the activity according to the before and after of Bitcoin. The tourism sector increased in November and December. This increased by more than 30%.” According to Valdez, the adoption of Bitcoin increased the number of tourists coming from the United States. She stated that before enacting the Bitcoin law, most visitors came from neighboring Central American countries such as Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. She revealed that currently, as many as 60% of the tourists come from the United States. As per the minister, travelers coming into the country were spending more money. She added:  “We had projected $800,000 in foreign exchange, but we obtained more than $1,400 million of income in foreign currency.”  The news about the surge in tourist numbers comes hot on the heels of an announcement by the country’s pro-Bitcoin president Nayib Bukele that El Salvador’s GDP had grown by a whopping 10.3% in 2021. Bukele stated that the country’s exports, an essential component of their economic growth, increased by 13% year-over-year in January 2022.  El Salvador’s GDP grew 10.3% in 2021.And now its exports (a main driver of economic growth) grew 13% this January, compared to January 2021.Are we looking at another double digit GDP growth this year?By the way, El Salvador never had a double digit GDP growth before 2021. https://t.co/f9yMkPpLNJ El Salvador formally adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021. A barrage of criticism from skeptics followed, with international financial institutions showing their displeasure at the decision. Besides making BTC legal tender alongside the USD, the Salvadoran government has bought Bitcoin on a macro-economic level. The country now owns some 1,801 Bitcoins, whose value is equivalent to $68 million at the current price.   President Nayib Bukele and his administration are also at the forefront of promoting some exciting projects. In October 2021, they vowed to employ some profits accumulated from Bitcoin purchases (back then, they totaled nearly $4 million) to create a massive veterinary hospital. Shortly after, the government stated it would use some investment gains to build 20 Bitcoin schools. Subsequently, Bukele announced plans to create an entire city focused on digital assets. The Bitcoin city will be located in the eastern region of La Union and will get geothermal power from a volcano. Bukele further revealed that the city would have an airport, residential and commercial areas, and a central plaza that looks like the BTC symbol from the air."

A Canadian managing partner said the move shows that cryptocurrency was a maturing asset class whose acceptance was growing in corporate firms in Canada.   Canadian Big Four Firm giant Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler (KPMG) has announced it added Bitcoin and Ether to its corporate treasury. The decision to allocate the two leading cryptocurrencies underscores the firm’s perspective on how emerging technologies like blockchain will eventually become part of the asset mix. The multinational is one of the top accounting firms globally alongside Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), and Ernst & Young (EY). The group is known as the “Big Four” due to its relevance and revenue. According to a statement by Benjie Thomas, an advisory services managing partner at KPMG in Canada, KPMG said the following on the firm’s recent Bitcoin and Ethereum bet: “Crypto assets are a maturing asset class. Investors such as hedge funds and family offices to large insurers and pension funds are increasingly gaining exposure to crypto assets, and traditional financial services such as banks, financial advisors and brokerages are exploring offering products and services involving crypto-assets.” Reports indicate that the KPMG acquired Bitcoin and Ethereum on its balance sheet through Gemini, with the two companies exchanging a brief interaction on Twitter. According to the statement, the firm stated it was also adding carbon offsets to maintain a net-zero carbon transaction to deliver on their ESG commitments.  We have just completed an allocation of cryptoassets to our corporate treasury, our firm’s first of its kind investment in the asset class. This includes Bitcoin and Ethereum tokens, and carbon offsets to maintain a net-zero carbon transaction: https://t.co/32hsKbnGuC KPMG established a governance committee with stakeholders from Finance, Risk Management, Advisory, and Audit and Tax to provide oversight and approve the treasury allocation. Specialists also assessed the tax and accounting implications of the transaction. KPMG now joins a host of institutional investors. Major corporations worldwide have turned to BTC for its safe-haven capabilities against U.S. dollar inflation and ETH and its ecosystem. Ether also hosts Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), decentralized finances (DeFi), and some experts called the future of the internet or Web 3 applications. Kareem Sadek, KPMG in Canada’s crypto assets and blockchain services co-leader, said: “We’ve invested in a strong crypto assets practice, and we will continue to enhance and build on our capabilities across Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and the Metaverse, to name a few. We expect to see a lot of growth in these areas in the years to come.” The number of institutions with crypto interest has been trending in appeal and value as Meta, Microsoft, and other companies attempt to enter one or all the sectors mentioned above on Ethereum. The decision by KPMG to plan to expand their investment to NFTs, metaverse, and Web 3.0 projects will help in the adoption of cryptocurrency and its mainstreaming."
2022-02-01 06:11:51+00:00,El Salvador Rubbishes IMF’s Demand to Drop Bitcoin Use,https://blockzeit.com/el-salvador-rubbishes-imfs-demand-to-drop-bitcoin-use/,"El Salvador’s president is optimistic about Bitcoin and has predicted an enormous price increase. His government has rejected a recommendation by the International Monetary Fund to drop Bitcoin as legal tender. The Salvadoran government has flatly rejected the International Monetary Fund’s recommendation that the Central American republic drops Bitcoin as legal tender. An angry treasury minister, Alejandro Zelaya, said that their Bitcoin adoption was an issue of sovereignty. Speaking on a local television station, Zelaya said:   “No international organization is going to make us do anything, anything at all […] countries are sovereign nations, and they take sovereign decisions about public policy.” In a statement last week, the International Monetary Fund urged El Salvador to abolish its Bitcoin policy, noting that its continuation posed risks to the country’s financial stability and consumer protection. The IMF recommended that El Salvador dissolve its $150 million trust fund, created when the government became the first country to make BTC legal tender in September 2021.  In dismissing that IMF’s recommendation, the government earlier stated that its adoption of Bitcoin had helped support financial inclusion for millions of people. Bitcoin adoption, along with the country’s Chivo wallet, was intended to offer financial services to individuals with limited access to banking. The Salvadoran government doesn’t see a need to scale back the scope of its Bitcoin law, but agreed regulation could be strengthened, according to a report. Bukele led the push to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. El Salvador’s Legislative Assembly made the country the first to do so in June, and the Bitcoin law went into effect in September. El Salvador and the IMF have been negotiating $1.3 billion in lending for months. In related news, the ever hopeful and optimistic pro-Bitcoin El Salvador president Nayib Bukele has predicted a massive price increase for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Even though Bitcoin has performed dismally in the last few weeks, Bukele believes it’s only a matter of time before BTC bounces back and registers an impressive price growth.  Taking to Twitter, the Salvadoran president spoke about the impending demand for Bitcoin would soon soar, and there wouldn’t be sufficient coins to meet the demand. In the Tweet, Bukele made a case for Bitcoin’s scarcity, noting that the shortage of Bitcoin will not be able to meet the increased demands of the cryptocurrency. He said on Twitter:  There are more than 50 million millionaires in the world.Imagine when each one of them decides they should own at least ONE #BitcoinBut there will ever be only 21 million #BitcoinNo enough for even half of them.A gigantic price increase is just a matter of time. “There will ever be only 21 million Bitcoin” and “Not enough for even half of them.”  He highlighted that there are more than 50 million millionaires in the world and that there isn’t enough Bitcoin for half that population."
2022-01-30 06:15:15+00:00,Shocked? Big Banks and Government Plan Crypto Takeover,https://blockzeit.com/shocked-big-banks-and-government-plan-crypto-takeover/,"Did you really think that the corrupt worldwide banking system and the governments they finance were going to let Bitcoin and stablecoins replace them? Really? In 2021, crypto enthusiasts became convinced that the US government is out to get them. Now those fears seem well-founded and not without reason: a string of decisions by the SEC and other regulators suggested that federal officials aren’t just apathetic toward the industry, but actively hostile to it. While many crypto supporters claim that the government is corrupt or inept, the reality is that the Biden Administration is pursuing a deft strategy to tame an industry that it regards as a threat. Interviews with former regulators and executives from top crypto firms reveal a sophisticated plan to take over crypto by handing over a key component of the crypto industry—stablecoins—to the big banks. Regulators believe that doing so now will bring the free-wheeling crypto economy to heel. After all, there are trillions of dollars to be made and the banks want to be the ones making it.  “It’s a very well-thought-out doctrine about how to keep the crypto industry from growing too fast and too much,” Maya Zehavi, a crypto entrepreneur and investor who has advised regulators, says. While many see Gary Gensler, the ambitious SEC Chair, as the architect of the Biden Administration’s anti-crypto policies, his influence has been exaggerated. Instead, it appears that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and a group of Federal Reserve veterans are in charge. According to Zehavi and others, the Biden Administration does not intend to eliminate stablecoins entirely. Instead, the goal is to eliminate “shadowy” operations like Tether while bringing “regulator-friendly” ones like Circle and Paxos under the auspices of the US banking system. Recent regulatory actions indicate that the plan is already in place. The question now is whether the crypto industry can avoid being owned by the same large banks that it was designed to disrupt. Bitcoin was created in 2008, but it took more than a decade for the US government to take cryptocurrency seriously. It was due to stablecoins that it happened when it did. The announcement by Facebook in 2019 that it would launch its own digital currency was a watershed moment, according to the non-profit Coin Center. The currency, originally dubbed Libra, would be a stablecoin pegged to a basket of government-issued currencies, according to the company. Facebook was not the first to come up with the concept of a stablecoin. Crypto users have relied on digital tokens pegged to so-called fiat currencies such as the US dollar or the euro since 2014. However, when Facebook announced that it would offer a stablecoin to its more than 2 billion users, Congress sat up and took notice. The company’s cryptocurrency ambitions represented more than just a new product; they also posed a challenge to governments’ power over the purse. “If Facebook raised an army, this would be only slightly more hostile to the people of the United States,” crypto lawyer Preston Byrne wrote at the time. Stablecoins have yet to enter the mainstream, but they have become an important part of the crypto industry. Tokens such as Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC provide a hedge against volatility while also allowing traders to avoid the fees associated with converting money back to traditional currency. It also doesn’t hurt that stablecoins make it easier to avoid the tax and legal regimes that kick in when a customer crosses so-called “fiat rails,” where traditional banks operate. All of this comes as the US Treasury has grown wary of challenges to its sovereignty, such as efforts by geopolitical rivals Russia and China to undermine the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency. While China has promoted the digital yuan as one alternative, America’s adversaries would be just as happy if Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency replaced the dollar in global commerce. These geopolitical considerations help to explain Facebook’s Libra project’s backlash (and to crypto writ large). The political backlash effectively killed Libra, but the broader stablecoin market is still thriving. Today, its market cap is around $155 billion, and stablecoin trades account for more than 70% of all crypto transactions on any given day. And it’s possible that this is just the beginning. Circle, the second-largest stablecoin issuer, told its investors in July that the value of USDC in circulation could reach $194 billion by 2023—an amount equal to Greece’s GDP. Circle, which is affiliated with cryptocurrency behemoth Coinbase, has long emphasized its efforts to stay on the right side of regulators, even as it has been embroiled in an SEC investigation and controversies over its reserves.  Tether has been dogged by more serious allegations of questionable accounting practices, as well as questions about whether some stablecoins are even backed by dollars at all.  As a result of all of this, stablecoins have emerged as the primary target of the federal government’s belated attempt to regulate the crypto markets. A January report from the Federal Reserve discussed the possibility of a central bank digital currency, but concluded that the Fed would not act without a clear mandate from Congress and the White House. Far more significant was a November report issued by the President’s Working Group, an inter-agency group composed of the country’s most senior financial regulators, including Yellen. The document, titled “Report on Stablecoins,” urged Congress to pass legislation requiring stablecoin issuers to operate as banks and to limit their “affiliation with commercial entities.” The report also stated that regulators may label stablecoin issuers as “systemically important,” a designation created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis to oversee institutions that are “too big to fail.” Few people believe the authors of the report are serious about treating stablecoins as too big to fail. Stablecoins, unlike the massive insurer AIG, which falls into that category, are not intertwined with the rest of the US financial system. According to non-biased data, the $155 billion stablecoin economy is a drop in the bucket when compared to money market funds, which are now worth nearly $5 trillion and have been a catalyst in previous financial crises. Claims that stablecoins pose an existential threat to the financial system appear flimsy in this light. Nonetheless, there is little doubt that US regulators see crypto as a threat to the financial status quo and believe stablecoins are the key to putting a stop to it. The Biden Administration intends to exert control over the stablecoin market—and potentially the broader crypto industry—via the Federal Reserve and two of its sister banking agencies: the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation (FDIC), both of which have enormous authority over the country’s banks. “There are many ways these banking regulators can strangle crypto if they impose all of these requirements from the traditional banking space into the crypto space,” says Mary Beth Buchanan, a former US Attorney who is now the top lawyer for crypto forensic firm Merkle Science. The Fed’s treatment of Kraken and Avanti, two crypto companies that have obtained state banking charters in Wyoming, is early evidence of the Fed’s anti-crypto stance. The firms applied for a so-called master account at the Fed more than a year ago, which is required for federal banking operations, but the Fed has so far refused to process them. Fed Chair Jay Powell recently justified the delay by citing the Wyoming firms’ applications as “novel” and “precedented.” Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis has argued that the agency’s inaction is both harmful and illegal. Meanwhile, the OCC has denied applications from other crypto companies for federal banking charters, which would allow them to obtain FDIC insurance, ensuring that traditional financial institutions, not crypto ones, are the only ones that can conduct day-to-day banking. As a result, banking regulators are poised to achieve their goal—forcing stablecoins into the corrupt banking cabal—but without providing crypto companies with a seat at the table.  People often ask why the world is the way it is, with so much wealth concentrated at the top 1/10 of 1 percent, stifling regulation, confiscatory monetary fees and the inability to move money digitally without paying through the nose. It’s the way it is because the institutions that control money and governments want it that way and they are bent on crushing any technology or innovation that threatens their primacy. “They’re just going to hand this over to the big banks,” says one former Wall Street executive who now runs a cryptocurrency company. “It’s a total JP Morgan snow job.”"
2022-01-27 05:08:44+00:00,Russia’s Putin Revives Hope for Crypto despite Central Bank’s Plans for Ban,https://blockzeit.com/russias-putin-revives-hope-for-crypto-despite-central-banks-plans-for-ban/,"Putin believes Russia’s surplus of electricity and well-trained personnel gives the country’s a “competitive advantage” in crypto mining. In a surprise turn of events, Russian strongman Vladimir Putin has given a glimmer of hope for the future of cryptocurrencies in the country. According to the emerging reports, Putin’s softening stance shows that he is unlikely to endorse a cryptocurrency. The president seems to believe Russia could do very well mining Bitcoin rather than outlawing it. Putting was giving opening remarks during a video conference with government ministers where he indicated the country possessed “certain competitive advantages” concerning mining cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. He suggested he would like to “start with an issue currently in the spotlight — the regulation of cryptocurrencies.” He stated: “Of course, we also have certain competitive advantages here, especially in the so-called mining. I mean the surplus of electricity and the well-trained personnel available in the country.” Russia has for a long time displayed a hostile stance toward cryptocurrencies, arguing that they could easily be used for money laundering or financing terrorism. The country eventually gave digital assets legal status in 2020 but put a caveat on their use as a form of payment for goods and services. The government plans to test its digital Rouble to enable payments to individuals and businesses and make its currency more global in the face of Western sanctions. Last week, Russia’s central bank had proposed a ban on cryptocurrency mining, the process through which powerful computers compete against others hooked to a global network to solve mathematical puzzles. At the same time, reports show that the banning pressure was linked to the Federal Security Service. Interestingly, Putin did not mention recent clampdowns on Russian ransomware gangs in his remarks. Putin told the meeting:  “The Bank of Russia deals with these issues and regulates them […] the central bank is not standing in the way of regulatory progress and is itself making the necessary efforts to introduce new technologies into this sphere of activity.” Russia comes after the US and Kazakhstan as the third-largest source of Bitcoin’s hash rate in the world over the past year, as miners left China amid a similar blanket ban. Given that neighboring Kazakhstan has been rocked by energy shortages, instability, and government shutdowns of the internet, the fate of the hash rate in the region remains an open question. Konstantin Shulga, CEO of digital financial marketplace Finery Markets, said the company estimated about 7% of the Russian population owns cryptocurrency. Russia has allegedly been toying with the crypto idea to render its economy immune to crippling economic sanctions imposed by the United States. However, the country has been reluctant to implement a unified legislative framework for cryptocurrencies. This comes at a time when nation-states, financial institutions, and technology giants are either embracing cryptocurrencies or making the admission that it’s a serious competitor to their industry. "
2022-01-26 05:05:45+00:00,IMF Asks El Salvador to Review Decision to Make Bitcoin Legal Tender,https://blockzeit.com/imf-asks-el-salvador-to-review-decision-to-make-bitcoin-legal-tender/,"Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele spearheaded the push to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. In June, El Salvador’s Legislative Assembly made the country the first to do so, and the bill became law on September 7, 2021. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is asking El Salvador to review its decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender besides strictly regulating the “Chivo” electronic wallet the government has pushed for adoption all over the country. According to a statement by the global lender’s board on Tuesday, the directors “urged the authorities to narrow the scope of the Bitcoin law by removing Bitcoin’s legal tender status.” The statement further said:  “There are large risks associated with the use of Bitcoin on financial stability, financial integrity, and consumer protection, as well as the associated fiscal contingent liabilities […] the adoption of a cryptocurrency as legal tender, however, entails large risks for financial and market integrity, financial stability and consumer protection.” The IMF’s report published following bilateral talks with El Salvador “urged” the government to narrow the scope of its Bitcoin law and consider removing its status as legal tender. The Central American country became the first country worldwide to adopt BTC as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. President Nayib Bukele has pegged the success of his political career on the success of his Bitcoin experiment. The president has acquired Bitcoin during the dip, getting an additional $15 million of “really cheap” Bitcoin as the crypto market plummeted. Bitcoin is down about 50% from its November record high. The comments by the IMF directors come hot on the heels of a previous announcement last November when its staff team visited El Salvador warned about the risks of using Bitcoin as legal tender in a concluding statement. IMF directors generally agreed with the previous staff report, including the view that increasing financial inclusion in El Salvador was important and digital payment systems like the government-issued Chivo wallet could have a role in doing so. However, they also underscored that the country needs “strict regulation and oversight of the new ecosystem of Chivo and Bitcoin.” The IMF’s take on Bitcoin in El Salvador puts the country in a catch-22 situation, especially following reports that the organization has been in lending talks with the Central American government. Bloomberg reported that the IMF’s concerns about Bitcoin have “stymied” negotiations with El Salvador about providing a $1.3 billion IMF loan. There have been concerns from the time when BTC became legal tender in El Salvador regarding the digital currency created to be beyond the control of governments would attract criminal activity. Bukele promoted the adoption for thousands of Salvadorans to avoid money transfer fees when relatives living outside the country sent home remittances. The rollout was glitchy but seemed to have smoothed out. Bukele has become the darling of the crypto community after speaking of plans to build a Bitcoin city and issuing Bitcoin-backed bonds, something else some IMF directors expressed concern over."
2022-01-20 04:57:34+00:00,Google Digital Cards Will Enable Users to Store Bitcoin and Spend Fiat,https://blockzeit.com/google-digital-cards-to-enable-users-to-store-bitcoin-and-spend-fiat/,"Google recently hired a former PayPal veteran to push deeper into the world of crypto. The firm has reportedly formed partnerships with Coinbase and BitPay to enable the new functionality. Tech giant Google is dipping its toes into the crypto sphere by introducing digital cards that can store cryptocurrencies on Google Pay. According to a report on Bloomberg, Google is partnering with Coinbase, BitPay, and Gemini in the venture, even as Bitcoin continues to gain widespread global acceptance.   According to the report, the Google team was looking for additional partnerships opportunities, though the company still isn’t accepting Bitcoin for transactions. Google’s president of commerce, Bill Ready, said in the report:  “Crypto is something we pay a lot of attention to […] as user demand and merchant demand evolves, we’ll evolve with it.” Its cryptocurrency integration will allow its customers to hold Bitcoin in their digital card and spend it as fiat currency. The existing arrangement doesn’t precisely use the peer-to-peer asset as a medium of exchange but enables users to spend their Bitcoin holdings. According to Bill Ready, the company wanted to show users: “The entire array of financial services out there […] our aim is to help create connections […] we’re not a conflicted party.” Known for its Google Pay system and mobile wallet, the firm that has previously largely avoided the crypto industry had a change of heart from last October when they hired a former PayPal executive Arnold Goldberg, to run its payments division after previously retreating from a push into banking. Ready further told Bloomberg:  “We’re not a bank — we have no intention of being a bank […] some past efforts, at times, would unwittingly wade into those spaces.” Google inked a partnership with Bakkt in October 2021 to become its primary cloud services provider. That was a few weeks after making a similar deal with Vancouver-based blockchain firm Dapper Labs.  The firm’s decision to allow users to store Bitcoin on their Google digital cards pushes it straight into the crypto space proper. Only time will tell how much longer it will take before they finally start accepting BTC, something that will give cryptocurrency adoption a positive boost. Delving into Bitcoin could also be a positive move for the firm, seeing that its payment division hasn’t performed particularly well or received a significant market share."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2022-01-13 12:23:34+00:00,Most of the Bitcoin Supply has Been Mined: Now What?,https://blockzeit.com/most-of-the-bitcoin-supply-has-been-mined-now-what/,"The total supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million. Due to the use of rounding operators in the Bitcoin codebase, the number of Bitcoins issued will almost certainly never reach 21 million and nearly 25% of the Bitcoin already mined has been lost forever due to lost wallet addresses mostly from early investors meaning the actual, total supply is closer to 17 million. When the Bitcoin supply reaches its maximum, no new Bitcoins will be created with transaction fees likely to be the only source of income for Bitcoin miners. Of the total 21 million Bitcoins that will ever be available, 90% have been mined within 12 years of the cryptocurrency’s creation. Satoshi Nakamoto, the person (or persons) responsible for creating Bitcoin kept the supply fixed in order to keep Bitcoin scarce and valuable. However, with only a limited number of coins available for mining, there are concerns about what will happen to the Bitcoin economy when the supply runs out. Satoshi set a maximum limit of 21 million Bitcoins on the market, regulating it through an algorithm in the source code. It is a scarce commodity due to its limited supply, which may help to increase its price in the future. No more than 21 million Bitcoin can ever be mined. Ever.  At a fixed rate of one block every 10 minutes, a new Bitcoin is added to the supply. However, the algorithm is designed in such a way that the number of new Bitcoins in each block is reduced by half (halving) every four years. Around 19 million Bitcoins have been mined, leaving only 2 million available for future mining. According to experts, the remaining Bitcoins will be mined by 2140. Miners play an important role in the creation of Bitcoin tokens by solving cryptographic puzzles in order to verify and validate a block of transactions in the network. Miners receive block rewards for their contributions to the network, which include newly minted Bitcoin and the total transaction fees paid in a block. The only problem for miners is that the block reward is also halved every four years. It was cut in half to 25 Bitcoins in 2012, and it was reduced to 12.5 Bitcoins in 2016. Miners stood to earn 6.25 Bitcoin for each new block in May 2020.  The mining process entails solving complex mathematical puzzles, which necessitates the use of high-end computational hardware (such as GPUs and CPUs), which consumes a lot of energy. Miners profit by using the money they earn from the block reward to offset the operational costs of mining. Yet, because the rewards are halved every four years, the cost of running the operation will eventually exceed the miners’ rewards. Mining may become an unsustainable business model for them as a result of this. However, because only a limited number of transactions can be confirmed every 10 minutes, transaction fees will gradually rise. While this can compensate miners for a lack of block rewards, the transaction amount is dependent on the network’s future state. Miners could also use innovation to increase energy efficiency and lower costs in the mining industry. The network is the most important aspect of Bitcoin. Any cryptocurrency’s heart is the distributed ledger model. If the number of transactions on the network increases in the future, the speed of the transactions may slow down. Bitcoin’s architecture prioritizes accuracy and integrity over speed. If the number of transactions in the network decreases, Bitcoin has the potential to become a reserve asset. Small retail traders will be pushed out, and large institutional players will take their place, potentially raising transaction fees and making trading more expensive. Scarcity will almost certainly lead to an increase in Bitcoin purchases. As FOMO (fear of missing out) sets in, there may be a rush to buy the rare asset, and those who already own it will be in a great position to sell. However, there is also hope that potential regulations will help keep volatility in check. If you enjoyed this article, you might also like: Could the Price of Bitcoin Ever go Down to Zero?"
2022-01-05 04:36:39+00:00,El Salvador Makes Progress toward Providing Legal Certainty for Issuing Bitcoin Bonds,https://blockzeit.com/el-salvador-planning-legal-certainty-for-issuing-bitcoin-bonds/,"El Salvador plans to spend roughly 20 bills to Congress to establish a foundation for issuing Bitcoin bonds. The country plans to give $1 billion in Bitcoin bonds to fund its previously announced “Bitcoin City” plans, including a proposal to grant nationality to Bitcoin holders who settle in the country. El Salvador has moved closer to actualizing the issuance of its Bitcoin bond. The country’s finance minister announced the government would send to Congress around 20 bills to begin rolling out the legal procedure. President Nayib Bukele then confirmed it via Twitter, saying:  Con las 20 nuevas leyes que enviaremos a la Asamblea Legislativa, sobre innovación y libertad financiera, lo lógico es que sea en El Salvador 🇸🇻 https://t.co/xeGBuXEtjr Translation: “With the 20 new laws that we will send to the Legislative Assembly, on innovation and financial freedom, the logical thing is that it is in El Salvador.” The financial instrument will be the first to be backed by BTC and issued by a national government. The bonds will be funded via taxes and will expire after a decade with a 6.5% estimated yearly return on investment. In addition, they will help El Salvador to finance their Bitcoin city project, which has a tentative cost of 300,000 BTC. In an interview with local news media, the Finance Minister for El Salvador Alejandro Zelaya talked about the country’s economic expectations for 2022, its incursion in the crypto market as a national economic driver, and their BTC-related strategy. Speaking to a local media outlet, the minister stated in a Tuesday interview: “This will provide a legal structure and legal certainty to everyone who buys the Bitcoin bond.” According to Zelaya, the novelty of this financial instrument creates the need to “regulate it.” In addition, the bills will make the legal net that will allow El Salvador to access $100 million from a regional financial institution. Zelaya added: “(The Bitcoin Bonds) need a regulation, a legal framework because we don’t have a law to issue crypto-backed securities; we don’t have a law to oversee exchanges […] this is the type of legislation that we will send to Congress to provide a legal framework and legal certainty to everyone that will buy the Bitcoin bonds.” Soon after making Bitcoin legal tender in September 2021, President Nayib Bukele announced the country’s ambitions to issue its first Bitcoin bond in November when he revealed that it would build a city dedicated to the world’s leading crypto. According to the plan, “Bitcoin City” will have its own residential and commercial areas, restaurants, and a plaza and will initially be funded by the Bitcoin bond, Bukele said at the time.  The President also promised that Bitcoin City residents would be exempt from paying income tax, property tax, capital gains tax, and payroll tax. The country plans to use half of the bond for energy and mining infrastructure, and the rest will be invested in Bitcoin. Blockstream is developing the bond on the Liquid Network."
2022-01-03 05:08:58+00:00,El Salvador President Nayib Bukele Believes More Countries Will Adopt Bitcoin in 2022,https://blockzeit.com/el-salvador-president-nayib-bukele-believes-more-countries-will-adopt-bitcoin-in-2022/,"The ambitious pro-Bitcoin head of state made several predictions for BTC for 2022. The six-point forecast included the price of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 and two more countries adopting the cryptocurrency as legal tender.  The Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele took to Twitter to make wild predictions about Bitcoin for 2022. The President’s New Year predictions made some bold bets; including that two more countries would fall in line and adopt the cryptocurrency as its local currency. 2022 predictions on #Bitcoin:•Will reach $100k•2 more countries will adopt it as legal tender•Will become a major electoral issue in US elections this year•Bitcoin City will commence construction•Volcano bonds will be oversubscribed•Huge surprise at @TheBitcoinConf President Bukele claimed his place in the history of the crypto sphere when he became the first head of state to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender on September 7, 2021. Bukele’s decision sparked a revolution that caught the attention of many world leaders. Regardless, he believes two more countries will follow this example. El Salvador is now considered the most open country in terms of Bitcoin adoption, following the country’s pro-Bitcoin activities. After voting BTC to become legal tender in the country, Bukele hasn’t wasted a chance to explain the merits of BTC and has gone on to accumulate more coins during price dips. The President announced the country would use the profits of BTC sales to build schools and hospitals.  Bukele’s predictions are intriguing especially considering that El Salvador’s Ambassador to the United States, Milena Mayorga, said that if successful in their country, other countries “will follow” in Bitcoin adoption. Bukele stated:  “Bitcoin will become a major electoral issue in US elections this year.”  Indeed, many politicians, including 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang and Republican Senators Cynthia Lummis and Warren Davidson, have voiced their support for BTC. At the same time, others have expressed their concern over the asset. For instance, Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that Bitcoin is only beneficial to the rich. She said:  “I’m anxious to see how Bitcoin regulation will develop in America, with more and more politicians educating themselves on the issue.” The construction of Bitcoin City is another point raised in the President’s statement. The city is expected to have 0% income, capital gains, property, payroll, or municipal taxes, in addition to 0% CO2 emissions. Bukele also said he expects Bitcoin bonds issued on Block stream’s Liquid Network to “be oversubscribed. The Bitcoiner’s paradise announcement came at the end of Bitcoin week in El Salvador.” This tweet will age well 😎 Bukele is betting that BTC will finally reach the long-awaited $100,000 mark in 2022. The President also promised a “huge surprise” at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami, Florida. One can only wonder what he has up his sleeve for the event he is supposed to attend in April. Following up with a secondary tweet, the President said, “This tweet will age well.” It seems Bukele has a sense of certainty in his predictions, but we will have to wait and see when and if they all come true this year."
2021-12-30 06:06:44+00:00,The 3 Most-Historic Instances for Cryptocurrency Adoption in 2021,https://blockzeit.com/the-3-most-historic-instances-for-cryptocurrency-adoption-in-2021/,"2021 has been one of the best years for cryptocurrencies in recent times. Several jurisdictions warmed up to Bitcoin and other digital assets and the all-time-high price in November, without forgetting adoption as legal tender. This article will examine the three most historic regulatory moments for cryptocurrencies in 2021. Taking the bull by its horns, the smallest country in Central America threw caution to the wind and made history by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. The date September 7, 2021, will remain historic since it’s when pro-crypto President Nayib Bukele’s Bitcoin law made BTC legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. The Salvadoran legislature then passed the law, which received a qualified majority of 62 out of 84 votes. The “Land of Volcanoes” also decided to deploy its volcanic activity to generate new Bitcoins. In September, President Bukele teased a Bitcoin mining factory powered by volcanic geothermal energy in El Salvador, marking a significant case to reduce BTC’s carbon footprint. Soon after, Bukele raised the stakes even higher when he announced his intention to create an entire city of Bitcoin, funded by BTC bonds. The recent decision by Canada’s securities regulator to license the world’s first physically-settled Bitcoin ETF earns the country a spot as one of the world’s most crypto-friendly nations. The Bitcoin ETF launched in February experienced a massive reception, trading over $564 million in assets within five days of starting.   In December, Canada extended its leadership in the Bitcoin ETF race when Fidelity Canada launched its Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF and the eponymous mutual Bitcoin ETF fund. The country has proved itself hospitable to cryptocurrencies as it became among the first countries to recognize crypto firms as money service businesses in 2020 officially. Data from Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index shows that Canada is currently ranked the fourth largest country in Bitcoin mining power, accounting for 9.6% of the total global hash rate. Dubai, the capital city of the seven emirates, recently emerged as the most crypto-friendly country globally. After noticing that the adoption of crypto is steadily increasing, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) announced plans to establish a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework as part of its 2021 business plan. In October, the DFSA subsequently issued several regulatory approvals, including one for a primary Canadian investment product, The Bitcoin Fund. DFSA has also been working on investment vehicles like security and derivative tokens. The Dubai World Trade Centre Authority said it would become a comprehensive zone and regulator of cryptocurrencies, products, operators, and exchanges in mid-December. 🇦🇪 pic.twitter.com/QrgxaHKAp9 UAE regulators have also come up with multiple arrangements to officially allow and support crypto trading in several free economic zones in Dubai. The nation has also been making strides in Nonfungible tokens (NFT) adoption as its postal operator issued NFTs in November to commemorate the federation’s 50th National Day. In October, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao reportedly bought his first home in the “very pro-crypto” Dubai. The Chinese-Canadian business executive had previously claimed that he did not own any real estate as of April 2021."
2021-12-29 05:45:51+00:00,El Salvador President Mulls Putting an End to Fiat Currency Use,https://blockzeit.com/el-salvador-president-mulls-putting-an-end-to-fiat-currency-use/,"President Bukele says the adoption of Bitcoin is changing the country’s economic landscape. He believes the time is up for fiat currency, and crypto should be used as a matter of priority.  Three months into experimenting with Bitcoin as legal tender, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has once again reaffirmed his belief in BTC’s supremacy. The President has this time stated on Twitter, “its game over for fiat” as the leading cryptocurrency experienced widespread adoption.  The 40-year-old pro-crypto Salvadoran President uses his official Twitter handle to announce Bitcoin purchases the country makes. He is also famous for giving updates about how Bitcoin favors the Salvadoran economy via his official Twitter handle. Bukele used his latest tweet to hit back at those who have raised questions regarding El Salvador’s decision to legalize Bitcoin. What has been called by international organizations as “The #Bitcoin Experiment”, is nothing more than the world watching how mass adoption changes a country’s economy.If it’s for the good, it’s game over for FIAT.El Salvador is the spark that ignites the real revolution. Despite pressing hard on the gas pedal toward Bitcoin use and adoption, Bukele’s move continues to receive a barrage of warnings and criticisms. The International Monetary Fund has continuously sounded warnings on the use of Bitcoin as legal tender. The IMF believes that the high volatility of cryptocurrencies poses a risk to factors like consumer protection, financial integrity, and financial stability. In early December, Bank of England (BoE) governor Andrew Bailey expressed his misgivings about the goings-on in El Salvador, wondering if Salvadorans were aware of the risks associated with the use of cryptocurrencies. The continued concerns are happening at a time when countries like India are mulling the legitimacy of Bitcoin. Russian President Vladimir Putin is on record for recently expressing criticism on the crypto space based on its volatile nature. Despite all the fuss, Bukele presses forward and continues to bring in more crypto-related items and activities to his country.   Following the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador has used profits made from BTC or “surplus” from its Bitcoin trust account to finance the construction of 20 schools. In mid-October, the government announced it would spend $4 million from the Bitcoin Trust to build a new veterinary hospital in San Salvador. Bukele’s latest riff comes as El Salvador recently bought 21 BTC on Tuesday to celebrate the “last 21st day of the year 21 of the 21st century” and commemorate the scarcity of Bitcoin as its supply is limited to 21 million BTC. The country now has close to 1,500 Bitcoins in its reserve, which adds up to $76,417,935. "
2021-12-23 04:56:18+00:00,Twitter Co-Founder Jack Dorsey Believes Bitcoin Will Replace U.S. Dollar,https://blockzeit.com/twitter-co-founder-jack-dorsey-believes-bitcoin-will-replace-u-s-dollar/,"Dorsey, a big supporter of Bitcoin, is also co-founder and CEO of financial services company Block, formerly known as Square Inc. The tech billionaire’s interaction with a Grammy Award-winning rapper and about crypto usurping the dollar prompted many reactions on Twitter. Jack Dorsey, a former CEO of micro-blogging platform Twitter, has said he believes Bitcoin will replace Bitcoin someday. Dorsey was replying to a tweet by award-winning rapper and songwriter Cardi B, who had asked whether there was a chance BTC could replace the U.S. dollar. Dorsey replied: Do you think crypto is going to replace the dollar? “Yes, Bitcoin will.” Dubbed digital gold, crypto enthusiasts have touted Bitcoin as a replacement for gold for a long time. This leading cryptocurrency hit that all-time-high price of over $68,000 in November before it slid back to around $50,000. Dorsey recently stepped down as Twitter CEO and hinted then he wanted to focus heavily on cryptocurrencies.     Earlier this month, Dorsey changed Square Inc.’s name to Block — possibly in reference to the blockchain ecosystem, the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies. In a press release, the company said that the change referred to “Building blocks, neighborhood blocks, and their local businesses, communities coming together at block parties full of music, a blockchain, a section of code, and obstacles to overcome.” Dorsey stated:  “We built the Square brand for our Seller business, which is where it belongs […] Block is a new name, but our purpose of economic empowerment remains the same. No matter how we grow or change, we will continue to build tools to help increase access to the economy.” Dorsey hinted recently that Block would build a Bitcoin mining system based on custom silicon and open source for individuals and businesses. He said this would add to Square Inc.’s existing Bitcoin-focused projects, including a company to build an open developer platform and a hardware wallet for the cryptocurrency. He explained in a tweet:  “If we do this, we’d follow our hardware wallet model: build in the open in collaboration with the community.” Square is considering building a Bitcoin mining system based on custom silicon and open source for individuals and businesses worldwide. If we do this, we’d follow our hardware wallet model: build in the open in collaboration with the community. First some thoughts and questions. Dorsey is a renowned Bitcoin investor whose love for cryptocurrency dates back to 2017, when he started advocating Bitcoin as the king coin. When the crypto market crashed in 2018, Dorsey was unfazed, calling Bitcoin the future world currency, despite the digital currency being at its lowest point in several years. In March 2019, Dorsey had said that he spends several thousand dollars each week to buy Bitcoin."
2021-12-08 09:52:29+00:00,"Billionaire Barry Sternlicht Predicts BTC will Rise to $ 1 Million, Calls Bitcoin a Smart Hedge",https://blockzeit.com/billionaire-barry-sternlicht-predicts-btc-will-rise-to-1-million-calls-bitcoin-a-smart-hedge/,"The chairman of Starwood Capital Group shared his views on how Bitcoin could grow to be worth a million dollars a coin. He said the cryptocurrency is a “smart” that could help fight inflation brought by excessive printing of fiat currency. Billionaire Barry Sternlicht believes Bitcoin could eventually reach $ 1 million per coin. The chairman of Starwood Capital Group spoke about the prospects for cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, during a speech at a Bloomberg event in Miami. Sternlicht, who runs a private equity firm specializing in real estate investments and manages around $ 100 billion in real estate, debt, and energy assets, called Bitcoin a “smart” hedge. The tycoon’s address focused on the general outlook of crypto in the coming days amid several countries’ continued efforts in printing fiat money. Noting that he called his Bitcoin stance a “big hedge,” the billionaire was asked, “Is this how we should all be thinking?” Sternlicht firmly replied: “Yes.” Sternlicht explained that we live “in a world where the government just prints money, and prints money, and prints money, and prints money, and it doesn’t seem to have consequences. Noting that “Sometimes it will end,” stressed the billionaire: “The only thing that they can’t make more of is Bitcoin […] never been hacked […] it has no real value other than there are 21 million coins” that are “infinitely divisible.” The real estate investor opined that due to the U.S’s political isolationism, China was trying its level best to knock down the value of the American dollar. In trying to make a comparison, Sternlicht opined that even gold didn’t possess so much value, saying that anyone could easily fake gold jewelry. He said he believed the Chinese “are going to have a lot of countries aligned with them.” Barry Sternlicht insisted that China won’t give up easily. He added that it is evident; China will use everything at its disposal to break the dollar value. Supposed that becomes the case, and the dollar lost its value, then there was one thing that could maintain its value, BTC. While admitting that Bitcoin “will go down with the stock market,” he stressed that in his opinion, “it will reverse,” elaborating: “It would go to $1 million a coin. It could do that because everyone, it’s not U.S. investors, the whole world will look at one thing that they can’t make more of, and that would be Bitcoin.” The billionaire revealed that he held around 2% to 3% of his net worth in cryptocurrencies. Regarding investing in crypto, he said: “If it reaches zero, it won’t hurt me either, it won’t hurt you […], but if that hits $ 1 million apiece, you’re going to watch TV and get upset.”"
2021-12-06 12:12:45+00:00,El Salvador President Lectures Peter Schiff on Advantages of Bitcoin over Gold,https://blockzeit.com/el-salvador-president-lectures-peter-schiff-on-advantages-of-bitcoin-over-gold/," President Nayib Bukele told long-time Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff BTC was more rewarding than gold. Bukele revealed said if his country converted its 44,000 ounces of gold reserve worth $79M to BTC, it would now be worth $204M. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele has told the head of Euro Pacific Capital Inc. Bitcoin was a more reliable asset than gold. Bukele, a Bitcoin-enthusiast, faced off in a Twitter chat with the renowned Bitcoin critic over the weekend after the latter criticized the former for buying more Bitcoin during the dip. None.We’re already in the green from our last purchase, in less than 24 hours.You know boomer, we have 44,106 oz of gold in our reserves.Worth $79 million, down 0.37% from a year ago.If we had sold it a year ago and bought #Bitcoin, it would now be valued at $204 million. https://t.co/e5z9cVsfjg El Salvador bought 150 more Bitcoin on Friday night as BTC dipped from $52,000 to below $44,000K. Taking to Twitter, Schiff questioned Bukele on this move, asking: Bukele explained that if El Salvador had sold gold and bought Bitcoin last year, the treasury would have had more than $125 million (~£95 million) in its coffers. “There’s a lot more dips coming.  How much taxpayer money do you intend to waste?” To this, President Bukele replied: “None. We’re already in the green from our last purchase, in less than 24 hours.” The Salvadoran president went on to explain to Schiff that his country will have to live with millions in losses for failing to convert its gold reserve to Bitcoin a year ago, possibly implying that Schiff has been experiencing the same losses too. Bukele stated: “You know, boomer, we have 44,106 oz. of gold in our reserves. Worth $79 million, down 0.37% from a year ago. If we had sold it a year ago and bought #Bitcoin, it would now be valued at $204 million.” Spencer, Peter Schiff’s son, doesn’t seem to ascribe to the same school of thought as his father. Spencer made a comment that indicates he could be a strong Bitcoin proponent. It’s reported that Spencer went into a Bitcoin buying spree last March and dedicated 100 percent of his portfolio to holding Bitcoin. Unlike his father’s criticism, Spencer encouraged Bukele in his pursuit of the world’s largest digital asset, saying: Bitcoin pumpers claim that #Bitcoin is a better store of value than #gold because it's price has risen more than gold's price. By that logic #Ethereum is a better store of value than Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is gold 2.0 then Ether is Bitcoin 2.0. Has Ether already disrupted Bitcoin? “My dad’s reply is your signal to buy more.” Bukele’s sentiments on the difference in value between Bitcoin and gold aren’t far-fetched after all. MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor made similar remarks in September this year. Saylor opined that if he had chosen to invest in gold instead of Bitcoin last year, the mistake would have cost him several million dollars. MicroStrategy bought an extra 7002 Bitcoin at the end of November, increasing its holdings to 121,044 BTC. In September, El Salvador became the first country to make Bitcoin a legal tender. There has been a barrage of criticisms from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and several other countries, but Bukele doesn’t seem to be bothered at all."
2021-11-29 05:51:34+00:00,Singapore Approves Two Bitcoin Funds that Trade Physical BTC,https://blockzeit.com/singapore-approves-two-bitcoin-funds-that-trade-physical-btc/," The Fintonia Bitcoin Physical Fund offers professional investors direct exposure and enables them to purchase actual Bitcoin. The Fintonia Secured Yield Fund allows Bitcoin holders to obtain cash by putting their BTC as collateral. Singapore’s financial watchdog, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has licensed Fintonia Group’s Fintonia Bitcoin Physical Fund and the Fintonia Secured Yield Fund. The products target professional and institutional investors seeking direct, passive Bitcoin exposure and an avenue for obtaining loans on their BTC holdings. According to a report on the Fund Selector Asia, the physical fund aims to provide investors with will provide investors with “quick, safe, and cost-efficient” access to Bitcoin while removing the challenge of buying from one of the thousands of exchanges and keeping the Bitcoin secure. Fintonia founder and chairman Adrian Chng stated:  “The funds are live, and investors can subscribe and regularly redeem as they are open-ended funds, similar to a mutual fund. The funds are only available for accredited investors.” Chng explained that the fund would enable efficient cash or crypto transfers, resolving the challenges around moving large amounts of cash in or out of the system. He said further that ‘to address investors’ security and hacking concerns, Fintonia Group will secure the Bitcoin assets with a licensed and insured custodian with expertise in crypto/digital assets security and technology. He added:  “As a MAS regulated fund manager with strict standards, we can connect with multiple exchanges and different market-makers, enabling us to find the best prices, as well as buy or sell at volume.”  As for the Fintonia Secured Yield Fund, the press release explained that it would offer investors access to private loans secured by Bitcoin. Chng explained:  “Bitcoin is an excellent form of collateral for loans. It trades 24/7 and is highly liquid, with approximately $30 billion to $60 billion per day. If required, it can be quickly liquidated in comparison with, for example, commodities and real assets.”  Bitcoin funds provide an easy, hassle-free investment experience. Investors can obtain exposure to the price of BTC by purchasing the fund’s shares from their regular broker. However, convenience comes at a cost. Only by holding Bitcoin directly will an investor be able to take advantage of the financial sovereignty and freedom enabled by the Bitcoin Network.

2021-11-26 04:44:44+00:00,"Bitcoin Sets Sights on MasterCard, Visa after Surpassing PayPal in Quarterly Volume",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-sets-sights-on-mastercard-visa-after-surpassing-paypal-in-quarterly-volume/," The Bitcoin network’s volume processed has already surpassed PayPal by over 62%, reaching $489 billion per quarter. The report suggests that Bitcoin can match the dollar value of cash transferred on MasterCard’s network by 2026.  The Bitcoin network has processed more value in dollars than PayPal so far this year. A report by Blockdata revealed that even though Bitcoin still lags behind MasterCard and Visa, there are chances the world’s leading peer-to-peer network could overtake the credit card firms as early as 2026, but no later than 2060.  The market intelligence report dubbed “When might the Bitcoin network process volumes like Mastercard and Visa?” pointed out that the Bitcoin network processed about $489 billion per quarter in 2021, which is greater than PayPal’s $302 billion. Bitcoin, which has been in existence for only 12 years, processes about 27% of MasterCard’s $1.8 trillion per quarter and 15% of Visa’s $3.2 trillion. The report stated:  “It’s impressive how Bitcoin, as a 12-year-old decentralized network, is 27% of the way in terms of one metric (volume processed) compared to Mastercard, a company founded in 1966.” According to the report, Bitcoin could catch up with MasterCard and Visa but only after overcoming three obstacles. The report listed increasing the number of transactions, the average amount of Bitcoin sent per transaction, and a price increase.  The report suggested that if Bitcoin increased its value transferred by 260%, the cryptocurrency would catch up with MasterCard. BTC would need to increase its volume by 540% to reach the volumes processed by Visa.  In terms of pricing, Bitcoin would need to reach $245,000 to reach MasterCard’s levels or $435,000 to rise to Visa’s level. Blockdata suggested that at the current growth rate in 2021, Bitcoin could overtake MasterCard as early as 2026.  The Blockdata report suggests that the number of transactions handled by the Bitcoin network per day would make a whole lot of a difference. At 25 million transactions per quarter, the network handles an average of 280,000 transactions daily. The introduction of Layer 2 solutions via the Taproot upgrade by the Bitcoin blockchain aims to solve the problem. The lightning network, which has seen explosive adoption since its introduction, can double the Bitcoin network’s daily output. The report said:  “All of the publicly available statistics, such as the number of nodes in the Lightning Network, the number of channels between these nodes and the amount of Bitcoin in these channels, are growing at an exponential rate […] if they continue to do so over the next decades, the Bitcoin network may process as many, or substantially more transactions than some of the other financial networks do.”"
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2021-11-23 05:12:12+00:00,Australian Senator Says Crypto is not a Fad and DeFi is Here to Stay,https://blockzeit.com/australian-senator-says-crypto-not-a-fad-and-defi-is-here-to-stay/," Senator Jane Hume acknowledged cryptocurrencies were not a fad and urged Australians to be careful lest they miss the enormous opportunities offered by decentralized finance (DeFi). Australia’s minister for superannuation, financial services, and the digital economy Jane Hume has come out strongly to defend cryptocurrencies and DeFi. On Monday, November 22, the politician spoke during the Australian Financial Review Super & Wealth Summit in Sydney. “Don’t be the person in 1995 who said the internet was just a place for geeks and criminals.”Cryptocurrencies are “not a fad”, Minister for the Digital Economy @SenatorHume has warned policymakers.Story via @Mazzaphrenia:https://t.co/XCAgnVcOxA#Bitcoin #BTC #Crypto Hume’s speech referenced an assertion by an official from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) calling crypto a fad. Emphasizing that it most certainly is not, Hume further urged policymakers to cautiously embrace blockchain technology like DeFi rather than act fearfully – because it is not going away anytime soon. She stated:  “We should tread cautiously, but not fearfully […] Australia mustn’t be left behind by fear of the unknown.” Despite his foray into cryptocurrency investments since 2014, RBA’s Head of Policy Tony Richards inferred in a speech last week that investing in crypto was “fad-driven.” Richards also said the “current speculative demand could begin to reverse,” leaving digital assets with minimal use cases.  Senator Hume also referenced an Australian Senate Committee report claiming that 17% of Australians invest in cryptocurrency. Hume stressed:  “This is an asset class that has captured hearts and minds, but beyond that — whatever you might personally think — it’s a technology that’s not going away any time soon […] so as an industry and as a government, we need to acknowledge this is not a fad.”  Senator Hume’s speech that elicited many reactions on Twitter also talked about the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CommBank or CBA) to get into crypto. CommBank announced early this month that it has partnered with cryptocurrency exchange Gemini “to allow its customers to hold and use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies via its 6.5 million‑user banking app.” The senator added: Thank you to the many people who have contacted me today with feedback on my speech this morning. There was a lot to cover, & I’m pleased to see it has generated the interest I’ve always believed these sectors deserve!You can read the speech in full here https://t.co/ZleavDufoZ “This will make CBA the first Australian bank — and one of just a handful of banks worldwide — to offer customers this sort of access.” Commenting last week, Commonwealth Bank CEO Matt Comyn said: “We see risks in participating in crypto […] we see bigger risks in not participating.” Speaking about Senator Hume’s speech, Steve Vallas, the CEO of Blockchain Australia, said the senator’s speech was “another critical step” in discussing the development of the local crypto industry. He said he believed the superannuation-focused forum for the senator’s speech is particularly significant. He said: Is today the day that the Superannuation industry met the crypto industry thanks to @SenatorHume's speech? I'll make a note. “Scaled mainstream adoption [of cryptocurrencies and blockchain] requires participation by the superannuation industry and fund and wealth managers, who disproportionately chart the path of the financial future of Australians.”"
2021-11-22 10:38:48+00:00,El Salvador President Plans to Build the World’s First Bitcoin City,https://blockzeit.com/el-salvador-president-plans-to-build-the-worlds-first-bitcoin-city/," The Oceanside ‘Bitcoin City’ will be at the base of the Conchagua volcano that’s being harnessed to power Bitcoin Mining in El Salvador. Bitcoin City will comprise residential areas, restaurants, a port, shopping centers, and everything that has to do with Bitcoin. Two months after making Bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar, El Salvador continues with its march toward becoming the ‘capital of Bitcoin.’ The country’s Bitcoin-loving president has a proposal to take his Bitcoin dream to new heights via a ground-breaking project dubbed the ‘Bitcoin City.’  President Nayib Bukele announced his initiative during the Bitcoin Week Conference, a program dedicated to celebrating the country’s adoption of BTC into the mainstream and increasing citizen participation. The president stated on Twitter:  “In #BitcoinCity we will have digital and technological education. Geothermal energy for the entire city and efficient and sustainable public transport […] we will have no income tax, forever. No income taxes, zero property tax, no taxes on hiring, zero municipal taxes, and zero CO2 emissions.” ""En #BitcoinCity no tendremos impuesto sobre la renta, para siempre. Sin impuestos sobre las ganancias, cero impuesto sobre la propiedad, ni impuestos sobre las contrataciones, cero impuestos municipales y cero emisiones de CO2"", Presidente @nayibbukele. pic.twitter.com/mPBemwVGV9 In what looked like a rock-concert atmosphere, President Bukele said the government would build “Bitcoin City” at the base of a volcano. He told those attending the government would offer a $1billion tokenized Bitcoin-based bond in partnership with Blockstream in 2022 and begin construction 60 days after the completion of financing. Commenting on behalf of Blockstream, Samson Mow said in a blog spot:  “We’ve been in talks with El Salvador for months, and we’ve put in a massive amount of effort in designing and modeling the bonds. This bond offering is something we think will be attractive to a wide range of investors ranging from cryptocurrency investors, investors seeking yield, HODLers, and ordinary people. We believe this bond has the potential to accelerate hyperbitcoinization and bring about a new financial system built on top of Bitcoin.” According to Bukele, the “Bitcoin City” would be built at the base of the Conchagua volcano to take advantage of geothermal energy to power both the city and Bitcoin mining – the energy-intensive solving of complex mathematical calculations day and night to verify currency transactions. El Salvador became the first country to pass legislation that made Bitcoin legal tender on September 7, 2021. Apart from backing Bitcoin with a $150 million fund, the government has incentivized Salvadorans to adopt BTC.  Everyone who downloads the Chivo wallet receives $30 worth of Bitcoin while buying fuel using Bitcoin attracts a subsidy. Skeptics have warned that a lack of transparency about BTC would easily attract criminal activity. They also aver digital currency’s volatility in value would pose a risk to those holding it."
2021-11-19 04:59:42+00:00,US City Installs Bitcoin ATM in Airport following Crypto Adoption,https://blockzeit.com/us-city-installs-bitcoin-atm-in-airport-following-crypto-adoption/," The crypto kiosk installation in the North Dakota city of Williston is the first government-backed Bitcoin ATM in a US airport. Passengers and other users can access the machine to sell or buy over 40 cryptocurrencies.  Williston, a small city in North Dakota, has claimed a spot in the $2.5 trillion digital currency market by installing a cryptocurrency automated teller machine (ATM) in its international airport. People using or working at the Williston Basin International Airport will access Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or 37 other digital currencies. City officials said theirs was the first “government-hosted” crypto kiosk at a US airport.  According to the official announcement, the City of Williston partnered with crypto service provider Coin Cloud to install the Digital Currency Machine (DCM) at the airport. The firm stated the DCM was “more than just a Bitcoin ATM” since it allowed users to buy and sell Bitcoin and 40 other digital assets with cash. Old school Bitcoin ATMs can’t do all that,” Coin Cloud asserted. Hercules Cummings, the finance director of the City of Williston, said in a statement: “This is an ambitious step in introducing and engaging the public towards cryptocurrency while proactively playing a role in building the digital ecosystem […] although we are a smaller rural community, we are making an impact. Taking this small step may pave the way for other government and commercial entities to follow suit.” The city of Williston is located part of the Bakken formation, which is well-known for oil and natural gas deposits. The initiative by the city build’s up on previous work on embracing cryptocurrency. The city’s dalliance with digital currencies started in May by accepting Bitcoin as payment for utility bills. According to Cummins, Williston was the first municipality in North Dakota and the third to accept crypto payments in the US. It is offered in partnership with crypto firm BitPay.  Cummings said the airport’s so-called digital currency machine could serve people who prefer not to use their bank or debit cards or don’t have access to traditional financial services. Ticketed passengers and non-travelers will have access to the machine as it will be placed before a secured area. People can also use the device to withdraw cash from their digital wallets. Cummins added:  “By the government accepting cryptocurrencies for utility payments now coupled with hosting cryptocurrency ATMs, a government is a key player providing exposure to the public and accelerating adoption of cryptocurrency […] as part of our roadmap. We will eventually cross these payment corridors over to licenses, permits, and other fees within the city.” The city’s officials said the airport’s digital currency machine would be available to serve people who don’t prefer to use their debit or bank cards or those lacking access to traditional financial services. The machine will be placed before a secured area where ticketed passengers and non-travelers will have access. People can also use the machine to withdraw cash from their digital wallets."
2021-11-16 13:38:39+00:00,Economist El Erian-Rues Selling Off His Bitcoin Too Early,https://blockzeit.com/economist-el-erian-rues-selling-off-his-bitcoin-too-early/," Allianz’s celebrated economist and senior economic advisor El Erian-Rues lamented misjudging and selling his BTC at $19,000 in 2020. El-Erian says he will buy again but will wait until the speculators are shaken out of the market.   The renowned economist Mohammed El-Erian has told CNBC he bought Bitcoin during the long crypto winter of 2018. It was when the price of BTC fell from a high of $20,000 to a lowly figure of about $3,000. However, El-Erian regrets that a ‘behavioral mistake’ saw him make a wrong judgment and sell off too early. Speaking during an interview during CNBC’s Dan Murphy on Monday, El-Erian said:  “I felt compelled to buy it — I really did […] I felt like I had framed it. I had this level, and I had an entry point.” El-Erian says he watched as the number one cryptocurrency came out of the ashes of the $3,000 capitulation and chose to sell when BTC hit that $19,000 mark in 2020. As things stand right now, Bitcoin has since surpassed the level at which it sold by far and is currently trading at an average of $60,000. According to El-Erian, there’s no way of telling the direction Bitcoin’s actual value was likely to take. He chimed:  “You really don’t want to ask me about valuations, because I don’t quite understand why $60,000, as opposed to $68,000, is the right level.” Regarding getting back to investing in Bitcoin, El-Erian says he will wait for a while until the market shakes off all speculators before he becomes comfortable enough to repurchase BTC. The famed economist believes in the value of Bitcoin and avers it could be on its way to replacing the Dollar as the dominant legal tender any time soon. He said:   “I think it will always exist in the ecosystem, but it’s not going to be a global currency […] it’s not going to replace the dollar.” Bitcoin made its debut into the crypto scene in 2010, trading at $0.0008 per token. As of the time of writing, on November 16, 2021, Bitcoin was trading at $60,427 per token. In a hypothetical case, if anyone invested $100 on the first day, they could have bought 125,000 Bitcoins. The initial investment of $100 should have gained over 8,000,000,000% and would now be worth $ 7,553,375,000. Such an investor should have found a slot among Forbes’ list of the world’s wealthiest people. "
2021-11-16 05:32:44+00:00,"Bitcoin Taproot Upgrade Brings Privacy, Scalability and Smart Contracts",https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-taproot-upgrade-brings-privacy-and-scalability-introduces-smart-contracts/," The Bitcoin Taproot upgrade is here. The upgrade has opened doors for smart contracts and will improve scalability. Sending BTC to taproot addresses will be cheaper and more secure.    The Bitcoin Network has activated a major, the largest in the last four years. The upgrade dubbed Taproot took place on November 14, 2021and brings more efficiency and privacy into Bitcoin transactions. The new update will include new features that will improve the Bitcoin network’s privacy, scalability, and security. The Taproot will also unlock the potential for smart contracts that can be used to eliminate intermediaries from transactions. Since June, the upgrade has been anticipated when over 90 percent of miners chose to “signal” their support. A waiting period was then initiated between the lock-in and the activation date. Commenting on the development, Alyse Killeen, founder and managing partner of Bitcoin-focused venture firm Stillmark, stated: “Taproot matters because it opens a breadth of opportunity for entrepreneurs interested in expanding Bitcoin’s utility.”  The Taproot has experienced widespread support from the crypto community ever since the idea came to the fore. The upgrade brings several technical improvements over the last upgrade that occurred in 2017. Among the top upgrades is the introduction of Schnorr signatures that allow for more complex transactions on the Bitcoin network.  Before the current upgrade, the Bitcoin network employed a cryptographic framework called Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). The framework required users to sign a transaction using their private key to approve it. The Schnorr scheme by Taproot will be faster and smaller than ECDSA, with linear signatures. Transactions from multi-signature wallets via Taproot will look like any other transaction, enhancing the privacy and security of transactions. According to the plan, this will eventually pave the way for the creation of smart contracts. The result is anticipated to be the end of the need for intermediaries and bringing Bitcoin’s network up to speed with the likes of Ethereum that inherently enables smart contracts. Fred Thiel, CEO of cryptocurrency mining specialist Marathon Digital Holdings, said:  “The most important thing for Taproot is…smart contracts […] it’s already the primary driver of innovation on the Ethereum network. Smart contracts essentially give you the opportunity to really build applications and businesses on the blockchain.” The Taproot has excellent potential, but it will take some time before all the features are fully effect. The upgrade will enable users to send or receive the new transactions until the Bitcoin wallet they are using supports it. This could take a while as most wallets do not support it at the moment. Bitcoin’s last major upgrade, SegWit, took almost two years to reach adoption levels of 50 percent."

The independent US label has joined other industry music players choosing to pay artists in cryptocurrency.  San Francisco-based Empire label has announced it forwarded an all-Bitcoin advance to musician Money Man (Tysen Jay Bolding) for his album titled –Blockchain Tomorrow’.

Moments later, Money Man is seen flashing the on-screen Bitcoin balance, which has already risen from the time it was transferred.   According to Empire, the payment to the Atlanta-based musician and crypto investor Money Man marks the first time a record label is paying an entire advance payment in Bitcoin. The label made the transaction via mobile payments platform Cash App, which also recently launched Cash App Studios, an initiative to fund artists’ projects.  A press release announcing the details reveals that Money Man “bought himself out of his previous record label contract through his earnings from early investments in Bitcoin.” The release quotes the musician cum cryptocurrency investor speaking at a Bitcoin Conference on a panel called “Pay Me in Bitcoin,” saying:  “Around 2014 when [he] first heard about it [he] started investing early […] it was just a few hundred dollars, and it went up and skyrocketed, so [now] a lot of times, I get paid for features in Bitcoin.” EMPIRE is a leading label that has played a critical role in launching the careers of multi-platinum, Grammy Award-winning artists like Kendrick Lamar, Cardi B, DRAM, and Anderso. The company’s founder said during the same panel in June he appreciated the use of Bitcoin in the music industry. He said BTC had brought a ‘level of transparency unprecedented in the music industry since it was founded in 2010.’ Shami added: “With blockchain ledger efficiency [and] speed, you could pay somebody on the other side of the globe in 30 seconds. I don’t need to get their BIC number, their swift number, their routing number, their account number, [or] their address […] ultimately, the peer-to-peer nature of it and how fast you can get money to somebody is what’s most important and that’s why I’m investing a lot of time and energy into it.”  Another artist, Meek Mill, recently took to social media to express his frustration with his current label and desire to get a better way. Meek Mill’s prayers may have just been answered through the history-making deal Money Man paid as the first artist to receive his label advance via Bitcoin. Last Tuesday, November 9, Meek Mill said on Instagram he was willing to follow in Money Man’s footsteps.  “Ima get my next record deal paid in Bitcoin behind @moneyman.” "

He thinks that as a new way of paying for goods and services throughout the entire globe, schools must teach about blockchain and cryptocurrency. The New York City mayor-elect Eric Adams is already thinking about introducing policy changes regarding blockchain technology and Bitcoin. Even though his swearing-in into office will happen in 2022, Adams believes children should be taught about blockchain technology. During CNN’s “State of the Union,” Adams said there was a need to increase Bitcoin and cryptocurrency awareness among young people. Adams stated:  “It is a cryptocurrency. It’s a new way of paying for goods and services throughout the entire globe. And that is what we must do: open our schools to teach the technology and teach this new way of thinking when it comes down to paying for goods and services.” Even though Adams didn’t specify what level of education he was referring to, he told CNN many young people would ask him what Bitcoin was when he mentioned it during his campaigns. Nonetheless, teaching cryptocurrency in schools isn’t an entirely new concept. Students from some local high schools to the university level are beginning to integrate crypto topics into their curriculum. Asked whether he would encourage businesses in New York City to accept Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, Adams said that they were “going to look at it” and “tread carefully.” He explained:  “I want to send a signal. This city was the Empire State […]. This is the center of innovation, self-driving cars, drone development, cybersecurity, and life sciences. So when I talked about blockchain and Bitcoin, young people on the street stopped and asked me: ‘What is that? What it is about?’” Adams’ pronouncement about teaching crypto in schools comes hot on the heels of his comment following crypto financier Anthony Pompliano’s to politicians to accept crypto payments. In what could be seen as a bid to outdo Miami’s Francis Suarez, who was first to take the challenge, Adams vowed to receive his first three paychecks in crypto. He added it would be part of his ongoing platform to turn the Big Apple into a center for innovation and crypto. Adams added:  “I want to make sure that this city becomes the center of innovation no matter what that innovation is, and this is what the human spirit is about: Not being afraid to look at every area of innovation as we move our country and city forward.”"
2021-11-08 11:45:17+00:00,MasterCard to Launch Crypto Payment Cards in the Asia Pacific,https://blockzeit.com/mastercard-in-partnership-to-launch-crypto-linked-payment-cards-in-the-asia-pacific/," Consumers and businesses will receive crypto-linked Mastercard credit, debit, or pre-paid cards that instantly convert their cryptocurrencies into traditional fiat currency. The cards will be used everywhere Mastercard is accepted around the world, both online and offline. The giant payment processor Mastercard has partnered with three cryptocurrency service providers Amber Group, newly minted crypto unicorn Bitkub in Thailand, and CoinJar in Australia, to launch crypto-linked Mastercard payment cards. The three companies are the first Asia Pacific Region-based cryptocurrency service providers to join the MasterCard Global Crypto Card Program.  MasterCard initiated a program that facilitates Fintech companies by reducing entry barriers, streamlining the onboarding process, and offering access to dedicated Fintech and digital asset experts and in-market teams to accelerate their growth and execution. Rama Sridhar, Executive Vice President, Digital & Emerging Partnerships and New Payment Flows, Asia Pacific, Mastercard, stated:  “In collaboration with these partners that adhere to the same core principles that Mastercard does – that any digital currency must offer stability, regulatory compliance, and consumer protection – Mastercard is expanding what’s possible with cryptocurrencies to give people even greater choice and flexibility in how they pay.” All three cryptocurrency service providers currently offer digital asset purchase and exchange services in their respective jurisdictions. All three of these digital asset service providers offer cryptocurrency purchase and exchange services in their domestic markets. With the new venture, the firms will find it easier to achieve their goals to make it simpler and faster for crypto firms to bring such payment cards to market. MasterCard’s new venture into the Asia Pacific market adds an extra crypto offering to the payment processor’s growing investment in the digital asset space. Apart from beginning a project to facilitate leading banks in offering cryptocurrency service, the firm recently acquired a Silicon Valley-based crypto-analytics firm Ciphertrace for an undisclosed price. The firm stated then that “digital assets have the potential to reimagine commerce.”  MasterCard has also recently partnered with Fintech company Uphold and crypto exchange Gemini to create crypto credit cards, and it’s also developed platforms to help governments test central bank digital currencies. Two weeks ago, the firm also pointed out that 77% of Millennials said they are interested in learning more about cryptocurrencies, with about 75% saying they would use crypto more if they understood it better. The cryptocurrency market has tripled during that past year alone, and speculation is high that the launch of the first Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States helped Bitcoin prices surge nearly 20% to an all-time high of roughly $67,000."
2021-11-03 09:00:29+00:00,Miami Mayor Will Take 100% of His Next Paycheck in BTC,https://blockzeit.com/pro-bitcoin-miami-mayor-declares-hell-receive-100-of-his-next-paycheck-in-btc/," The Mayor Francis Suarez will become the first politician to be paid fully in Bitcoin. The politician is advancing plans to pay city workers in BTC besides making Miami city the crypto capital in the world. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez will become the first United States’ politician to receive his entire paycheck in Bitcoin. The development follows a Twitter chat between the Bitcoin-friendly politician and famous crypto enthusiast Anthony Pompliano. Pompliano had taken to Twitter to request Mayor Suarez to make history by becoming the first politician to accept their paycheck in Bitcoin. Florida’s Mayor accepted the offer in less than 20 minutes. I’m going to take my next paycheck 100% in bitcoin…problem solved! @Sarasti can you help? https://t.co/v4YdPZ0tYc Mayor Suarez went on to ask Mike Sarasti, the director of Innovation and Tech at Miami City, to make it happen. In his reply, Sarasti indicated that he would help by tweeting “Mayor; Amazing” he typed in response, along with two “100” symbols and a Bitcoin symbol. The Miami Mayor’s statement came as a growing number of professional athletes and sports teams have adopted Bitcoin, including Russell Okung, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Saquon Barkley, and Sean Culkin. Mayor Francis Suarez is a leading proponent of cryptocurrency and desires to make Miami the first crypto city in the United States. The politician is working toward creating clean Bitcoin mining facilities besides allowing government employees to receive their salary in Bitcoin.  The Mayor is on record for proposing to invest the city’s funds into Bitcoin, but that plan didn’t go through as existing state laws don’t allow for investment in digital assets. Miami has also made history by becoming the first city to have its native crypto token called Miami Coin, built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain and mines new coins every ten minutes. The funds generated from mining Miami coins would be utilized for the welfare of the city. Suarez, who is seeking re-election, is the most vocal proponent of Bitcoin among U.S. politicians. He has been lobbying lawmakers in his city to allow government employees to be paid in BTC and allow taxes to be paid in the cryptocurrency, and for the city to invest a portion of funds in Bitcoin. He said last October that cryptocurrency was a “major priority” for him and tried to attract Bitcoin miners who were kicked out of China following a crackdown.  The other U.S. Mayors who are vocal Bitcoin supporters include Jackson, TN, and the Mayor of Cool Valley, Missouri. U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis is another pro-Bitcoin politician who has repeatedly insisted. Bitcoin is an excellent store of value. Commenting on Suarez’s statement, she tweeted: Bested by the gentleman from Miami. Well done, sir. https://t.co/QPiao9Maqm “Bested by the gentleman from Miami; well done, sir.”"
2021-11-03 04:44:34+00:00,Australia’s Commonwealth Bank Adds Crypto to its CommBank App,https://blockzeit.com/australias-commonwealth-bank-adds-crypto-support-under-new-app-pilot-program/," The banking App will support at least ten cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. The Industry has called the initiative a “red-letter day” for mainstreaming of digital assets. The Commonwealth Bank has announced that its customers will soon have access to cryptocurrencies via its CommBank App. The pilot program ahead of a major rollout in 2022 makes the CBA the first Australian bank to extend crypto exchange and custody services into a broader suite of traditional banking services, in a bid to compete with challengers like PayPal, who have made similar moves. According to the announcement, the CBA will offer crypto services in partnership with the Gemini Cryptocurrency Exchange and Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. The bank said the pilot program would include a limited number of customers. CBA Chief Executive Officer Matt Comyn said the initiative was necessitated by the surging appetite for cryptocurrency investments among their customers who have been calling for integration. He added:   “We believe we can play an important role in crypto to address what’s a growing customer need and provide the capability, security and confidence in a crypto trading platform […] in looking at ways that we can support our customers, we have made the strategic decision to form an exclusive partnership in Australia with Gemini, a global leader with strong security and a track record of serving large institutions.”  Commenting on the development, Blockchain Australia said it was inevitable that the other ‘big four banks, including National Australia Bank (NAB), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), and Westpac, will soon follow suit. Blockchain Australia CEO Steve Vallas said the move was “extraordinarily important” as the big four banks in Australia “underpin our national and international reputation as a financial services destination.” He added:  “The confidence that this provides local digital asset sector participants will be dwarfed by the impact that this signal sends around the world that Australia should be a destination for cryptocurrency and digital asset adoption.” Vallas opined the rapid growth and adoption of crypto had “shifted the risk of maintaining a wait and see approach” in the view of the big banks to a risk of “inaction” and being left behind. Vallas believes it is only a matter of time before the other major Australian banks launch their crypto services. The announcement caused early celebrations in the crypto community, with BTC Markets CEO Caroline Bowler calling the move “yet another red-letter day” for crypto in Australia. She said:  “CBA’s move is exciting and inevitable. It’s yet another ‘red-letter day’ for crypto. It is as though Australia has suddenly put the lead foot down […] we have been touted as playing catch up all this while. Still, now we’re moving into a leadership position globally with our largest bank. One of the most significant mainstream financial institutions in the world offering millions of customers access to cryptocurrencies.”"
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2021-11-02 05:28:25+00:00,NFL Quarterback Aaron Rodgers Will Take Portion of Salary in Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/nfl-quarterback-aaron-rodgers-says-hell-take-portion-of-salary-in-bitcoin/," Aaron Rodgers $22 million salary would be worth at least 358 Bitcoin at the current price of $61,428.78. Aaron is the latest celebrity to give Bitcoin a ringing endorsement by accepting Bitcoin for salary payment.  Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has announced via Twitter he will be taking a portion of his salary in Bitcoin. The legend said he had entered a partnership with Cash App that will also give out $1,000,000 in Bitcoin to fans in the comment section of his announcement. He stated:  I believe in Bitcoin & the future is bright. That's why I’m teaming up with Cash App to take a portion of my salary in bitcoin today.To make Bitcoin more accessible to my fans I’m giving out a total of $1M in btc now too. Drop your $cashtag w/ #PaidInBitcoin & follow @CashApp pic.twitter.com/mstV7eal04 “I believe in Bitcoin & the future is bright.” According to Spotrac, the player makes an average annual salary of $33,500,000. According to an NFL report in July, Rodgers would be earning a $1.1-million base salary on top of a $14.5-million signing bonus and a $6.8 million roster bonus from March, totaling roughly $22.3 million. Rodgers did not share any details on how much of his salary he’s chosen to accept in Bitcoin. For Rodgers and his athlete colleagues, Bitcoin is the new vehicle for storing their wealth into the future, seeing that inflation is also eating into their purchasing power. Even though he earns many times more than the average citizen, he is also a victim of the Federal Reserve’s decision to print more money and inflation. Many celebrities are turning away from fiat currencies and finding a solution in Bitcoin.  Aaron Rodgers joins a growing list of NFL players that are accepting Bitcoin as part of their payment. The leaders in the pack include North Carolina Panther Russell Okung and free agent Sean Culkin who jumped on board last year. The sports people’s decision to store their wealth in Bitcoin offers them safety, assurance, and true financial independence.  There is only 21 million Bitcoin that will ever be created, and no one can mine an extra one. Anyone paid in Bitcoin can sleep at night knowing that no government or person can devalue their purchasing power by expanding the monetary supply. Rodgers said on Twitter:  “Bitcoin to the moon. That’s why I’m pumped to share that I’ve recently teamed up with Cash App. They have enabled me to take part of my NFL salary in Bitcoin for the first time. Bitcoin can be a new concept & can be intimidating. To make it more accessible to my fans. I’m giving away $1 million worth of Bitcoin right now.”"
2021-11-01 10:31:18+00:00,PayPal Co-Founder Says Surging Bitcoin Price is a Sign of Inflation Worries,https://blockzeit.com/paypal-co-founder-says-surging-bitcoin-price-as-a-sign-of-inflation-worries/," Peter Thiel isn’t too supportive of Bitcoin at the current price but regrets not buying BTC when it was cheaper. The Billionaire has rebuked the U.S. Federal Reserve for not acknowledging inflation concerns, while crypto market prices show that those worries are strong. Venture capitalist and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel believes the increasing cryptocurrency prices prove there are concerns about inflation. Thiel was giving a keynote address at a conservative conference where he offered his thoughts on rising inflation. The Tech mogul opined the rising cryptocurrency prices proved that inflation is real. He went on to criticize Federal Reserves for downplaying it and bringing it under control.  Thiel said that when inflation is running havoc on the economy despite several assurances from various government agencies, Bitcoin and other crypto-assets have touched a record high. According to a Bloomberg report, the tech mogul wasn’t necessarily considering buying BTC at the moment. He stated:  “You know, $60,000 Bitcoin, I’m not sure that one should aggressively buy […] but surely what it is telling us is that we are having a crisis moment.” Thiel slammed the Federal Reserve for the way it’s dealing with the ongoing economic crisis. He explained that the central banking system had failed to acknowledge the significance of the situation and that its decision to print money would not have an inflation impact. Thiel decried that the U.S.’s Federal Reserve has had to print trillions of dollars in the last few years. Additionally, the FED’s balance sheet has been growing enormously, with more assets purchased in 2020 than it did during the Great Recession. This has also engendered worry about inflation. With an inflation rate lower than any fiat currency, Bitcoin has cut a niche for itself as a good hedge. Several companies are beginning to add BTC into their asset portfolios as a result. Chief among them is MicroStrategy, which is trailing the blaze for leading companies interested in cryptocurrency investment. MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor compares Bitcoin to digital gold and believes it is a better option than the precious metal itself.

The purchase brings to 1120 BTC coins since the government’s first purchase on September 6.  The President of El Salvador, a real Bitcoin maximalist, didn’t let the recent price clash scare him. Instead of getting worried about what would happen to the country’s Bitcoin, he just bought more Bitcoin. President Nayib Bukele announced via Twitter on Wednesday his government had purchased an additional 420 Bitcoin worth about $25 million. He said: It was a long wait, but worth it.We just bought the dip!420 new #Bitcoin🇸🇻 “It was a long wait, but worth it,” he tweeted, “We just bought the dip!” Wednesday’s purchase comes hot on the heels of last month’s purchase of 150 Bitcoin the El Salvador government added to some 550 BTC they had bought earlier. Shortly after that and in between the tweets, the price of Bitcoin grew by an estimated 0.4% or $100,000 (estimated profit), and the president announced they had already made a profit. He tweeted: “We’re already making a profit off the #Bitcoin we just bought.” Hahaha we’re already making a profit of the #bitcoin we just bought. Bitcoin became legal tender in El Salvador on September 7, following a law this summer. While there was no way to audit the government’s Bitcoin wallet independently, the timing seems to have been perfect for a president who has moved on despite the ongoing criticism. In a later tweet, Bukele said it was all due to a rebalancing of accounts in the country’s Bitcoin trust, which allows him to cash out in USD when Bitcoin goes up in price. On the flipside are observers who are still worried about the country’s latest Bitcoin purchase, especially concerning the security of the vast stash of cryptocurrency holdings. A Twitter user, @dolomiteHEX, wondered about the wallet’s private keys and what would happen if the wallet got hacked. The user asked:  “Who holds their private keys?”  According to El Salvador’s Central Bank’s Governor Douglas Rodrigues, the Latin American country is investing in Bitcoin, hoping that BTC would soon lose its reputation as a speculative asset and become a legitimate global payment system. Rodriguez told Bloomberg: “We don’t see any risks. Perhaps, upside risks […] “Bitcoin will become a payment system, a system for financial inclusion.” Even though the price of Bitcoin had slid downwards to $58,890 at the time of writing from the all-time high of $66,976 a few days earlier, the cryptocurrency was still over 20% higher than September 7 when it became legal tender in El Salvador."

The exchange allows users to buy, sell and transfer Bitcoins for free and only charges a fee when withdrawing the cryptocurrency from the platform. The leading peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading platform announced the launch of its Android mobile App on Monday, October 25, 2021. According to the press release, the App was available for download. The firm said the iOS version was still under development without giving a specific launch date for its release. The LocalBitcoins App already received over 10,000 downloads only hours after appearing in the Play Store.

2021-10-25 04:48:42+00:00,Colombia Following in El Salvador’s Footsteps with 50 Bitcoin ATMs,https://blockzeit.com/colombia-following-el-salvadors-footsteps-with-50-bitcoin-atms/,"With 50 Bitcoin ATMs, Colombia has the second largest number in Latin America after El Salvador’s 200 cryptocurrency ATMs. The rise in the number of Bitcoin ATMs is seen as a sign of migration from cash to crypto transactions in an area where cash has been king. Cryptocurrency adoption in the Latin American region has seen an upsurge following the recent decision by El Salvador to make Bitcoin legal tender. According to Chainalysis’ 2020 global crypto adoption index, Colombia is currently hot on the heels of El Salvador, coming in just after Venezuela. Out of the 50 Bitcoin ATMs, 29 were in the capital Bogota while the rest were spread across the country. Meanwhile, in El Salvador, there are currently 205 Bitcoin ATMs. Buda.com Chief Executive Office Alejandro Beltran opines that Colombia will continue to be an important crypto hub in the Latin American region. According to him, while Venezuela was ranked among the top 3 nations in the global adoption index, the increase in the number of Bitcoin ATMs in Colombia was due to an increase in transactions. In other words, it could be said that the Bitcoin ATMs were making some financial transactions more efficient than cash could offer. Beltran told Forbes:  “Colombia continues to be an important crypto hub in transactionality, and as Venezuela is in the top 3 in the global adoption index, the border position makes ATM systems good alternatives for consumers.” Additionally, the crypto situation in Colombia is unlike the other South American countries where economic and political upheavals have necessitated cryptocurrency adoption. A good case in mind is Argentina, where cryptocurrency adoption was caused by unending cycles of devaluation, default, hyperinflation, and a three-year recession. Bitcoin mining has taken off there, with foreign miners finding the $0.06/kWh electricity tariff for industrial customers attractive. Cryptocurrency adoption in Venezuela was caused by the shuttering of banks during the coronavirus pandemic and the surging inflation. The Colombian government has experimented with crypto and even established regulatory sandboxes between banks and nine crypto exchanges. Jehudi Castro, the Presidency’s digital transformation advisor and a member of the sandbox assessment group, opined that prohibiting crypto would be futile. "
2021-10-22 04:56:32+00:00,Walmart Shoppers Allowed to Buy Bitcoin at in-store Coinstar Kiosks,https://blockzeit.com/walmart-shoppers-allowed-to-buy-bitcoin-at-in-store-coinstar-kiosks/," The U.S. retail giant has launched a pilot program in which shoppers interested in Bitcoin can buy the cryptocurrency at Coinstar kiosks inside some of its US-based stores. According to a Bloomberg report, Walmart intends to expand the cryptocurrency service to serve more customers. Coinstar is famous for its coin-sharing machines. Walmart spokesperson Molly Blakeman said that the initiative involving 200 initial kiosks from the company had started earlier this October. With the help of Coinstar, the shoppers can now exchange cryptocurrency for paper bills and even gift cards. The two firms aim to build Bitcoin ATMs for over 8,000 kiosks. Sam Doctor, the Strategy Officer at BitOoda, a regulated cryptocurrency brokerage, said:  “Bitcoin ATMs have been around for a while, including in many supermarkets […] Walmart expands Bitcoin access to more people, though, and gives it further legitimacy among skeptics, should they roll it out beyond an initial pilot.” According to the deal with Coinstar, a customer will insert a paper bill into the ATM-like machine and receive a voucher. The Coinstar machines will charge a 4% fee for the Bitcoin option and a 7% cash exchange fee. Customers will be required to set up a Coinme account and pass a background check before redeeming a voucher. Walmart Communications Director Molly Blakeman stated:   “Coinstar, in partnership with Coinme, has launched a pilot that allows its customers to use cash to purchase Bitcoin […] there are 200 Coinstar kiosks located inside Walmart stores across the United States; that is part of this pilot.” The Walmart cryptocurrency pilot program comes hot on the heels of a high-profile hoax with a fake press release stating that the retailer would allow customers to pay with Litecoin. The fake news briefly sent prices of the little-known cryptocurrency surging. Soon after that, the firm advertised a job to develop “the digital currency strategy and product roadmap” while identifying “crypto-related investment and partnerships.” Sam Doctor said: “It is an expensive way to buy Bitcoin, but lowers the barriers to entry for first-time buyers of crypto.” "
2021-10-18 12:08:43+00:00,Bitcoin Joins the Big Board as US SEC Finally Approves a Crypto ETF,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-joins-the-big-board-as-us-sec-finally-approves-a-crypto-etf/," The United States’ financial regulator finally approved a cryptocurrency ETF. However, the Bitcoin futures ETF fell short of what some cryptocurrency purists want: a fund that holds crypto directly. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States finally approved the ProShares Bitcoin Futures Exchange Traded Fund (ETF); it is the first time the financial markets watchdog has approved a cryptocurrency-linked ETF. The long-awaited (ETF) was slated to start trading Monday, October 18, 2021. ProShares CEO Michael Sapir said:  “2021 will be remembered for this milestone […] Investors who are curious about crypto but hesitant to engage with unregulated crypto exchanges want “convenient access to Bitcoin in a wrapper that has market integrity.” For the last ten years, traditional finance firms and crypto entrepreneurs have sought permission to launch Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. However, the SEC delayed their applications of kept them pending indefinitely. The ETF approval will now enable institutional investors to access indirect access to the cryptocurrency market by investing in Bitcoin futures. Investors will get exposure to Bitcoin without holding the cryptocurrency directly via any ordinary brokerage account. The ProShares’ ETF will list under the ticker $ BITO and trade on the New York Stock Exchange. This latest development doesn’t come as a surprise, as SEC Gary Gensler has said on numerous occasions that the regulator prefers approving an ETF that tracks Bitcoin futures. The SEC has been wary of approving ETFs that track Bitcoin’s spot market due to its fear of price manipulation within the crypto space. The regulator said investors are safer when they invest in Bitcoin futures ETF over the regular Bitcoin ETFs. Douglas Yones, the NYSE’s head of exchange-traded products, said all was not lost as he foresees a range of crypto-linked ETFs getting approval, eventually. He added: “This is an exciting step but not the last.”  While the United States SEC is still dragging its feet and reviewing the Bitcoin and Ether ETF applications on its table, some institutional investors looked for opportunities elsewhere. For instance, Ark Invest, seeking to invest in ETFs tracking Bitcoin’s spot market, is currently doing so via the Canadian stock exchange. Canada and Brazil have approved a few Bitcoin and Ether ETFs over the past few months. The crypto sphere is still expecting the US SEC to approve a Bitcoin ETF tracking Bitcoin’s spot price."

President Bukele has challenged his critics and the media to research and verify his claims independently.   Six weeks after Bitcoin became legal tender in the Central American republic, Salvadorans’ interest in BTC is rising. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced on Twitter the official wallet App Chivo reported over 24,076 remittances, which adds up to a massive $3,069,761.05 in a single day. 2 new Chivo Facts:1. People are inserting way more USD (to buy #BTC) than what they are withdrawing from the Chivo ATMs (any media outlet can independently confirm this by visiting the ATMs).2. Today, we received 24,076 remittances, adding up to $3,069,761.05 (in one day). According to the President, the Salvadorans were converting more of their USD into Bitcoin compared to how much BTC they were withdrawing at the 200 BTC ATMs the government installed all over the country. And to skeptics and critics who continue to ridicule his claims, President Bukele maintained there was credible evidence that anyone could verify independently. He stated:  “Any media outlet can independently confirm this by visiting the ATMs.”  Despite the growing interest in BTC by a significant portion Salvadorans, opposition to the decision by the government to make the cryptocurrency legal tender has continued from some locals and international institutions. However, the current rate of interest in BTC shows that over 70% of Salvadorans who were initially skeptical about cryptocurrencies are warming up to them.  More Salvadorans are using Bitcoin through the local Chivo wallet compared to those who strictly use local banks. El Salvador has made over $4 million in profits so far from its Bitcoin investment as the price continues to soar. President Bukele announced recently his government would use the profits made from the government’s Bitcoin investment to build a pet hospital.  We’ll start building this pet hospital with our #BTC profits. pic.twitter.com/ontf9xiZJT President Bukele went ahead to share a video of an artist’s impression of the hospital. The big hospital will feature hair salons, offices, classrooms, and an auditorium in addition to medical facilities such as consulting rooms, operating rooms, rehabilitation, hospitalization, and quarantine rooms. He also reiterated he wasn’t selling any of the 700 BTC acquired for a national trust created to facilitate the immediate conversion between BTC and USD for Chivo Wallet users."
2021-10-15 08:10:09+00:00,Strike Launches ‘Pay Me in Bitcoin’ Feature for US-Based Users,https://blockzeit.com/strike-launches-pay-me-in-bitcoin-feature-for-us-based-users/,"The new feature enables users in the United States to instantly convert their entire paycheck or a portion of it into Bitcoin. Users can do so regardless of whether their employers have embraced Bitcoin or not. Lightning Network payments platform Strike has announced a new feature that allows users to convert their income into Bitcoin. The ‘Pay Me In Bitcoin’ feature enables users to use their bank accounts and routing numbers to convert using an App programmatically. The company’s founder Jack Mallers said in a blog post:  “I am unbelievably excited to announce and publicly release Pay Me in Bitcoin with Strike […] today. Anyone with a Strike account, no matter their employer, can get paid in Bitcoin.” According to the announcement, users can have their salaries deposited directly to their Strike accounts. Once their employers have made the deposit, the users can choose the automatically swapped amount and credited it to their Bitcoin balance. Strike is not charging a fee for the service. The development results from an experiment that began last year after National Football League player Russell Okung used Strike to split his $13 million salary 50-50 between Bitcoin and fiat. Since then, several other athletes followed suit, making the service available to Strike’s U.S-based. customers.  💥Pay me in #Bitcoin💥Strike users can now instantly convert their salaries into #Bitcoin – just like professional athletes! The payment platform’s founder said ‘Pay Me in Bitcoin’ is intended to create financial freedom for users who can’t get paid directly in Bitcoin. According to him, anyone in the U.S. or El Salvador can automatically sign up for Strike and start saving part of their income in BTC. He said that would enable them to shield themselves from “high inflation rates and be more sovereign over their money.” Maller said:  “If you are not getting a 25% raise every year and you are saving in dollars, you are not out-earning or out-saving the rate of inflation or the increase in the cost of living, and your quality of life will degrade as time goes on.” He added: “You don’t have to work for a special company, you don’t have to convince your boss to like Bitcoin, and you don’t need to nag your CFO to put Bitcoin on the balance sheet. All you need to do is share your Strike account details and configure your ‘Pay Me in Bitcoin’ split.” Strike’s expanded feature comes only a few weeks after Coinbase announced it would let users deposit all or part of their paychecks in crypto or dollars, also without a fee. Nonetheless, unlike Coinbase, which lists many cryptocurrencies, Strike strictly deals with Bitcoin. Strike is the company that facilitating the usage of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network in El Salvador."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."

However, he said it is too early to evaluate cryptocurrencies’ utility in the oil trade. The Russian President was speaking during the Russian Energy Week in Moscow on Wednesday. The country has been mulling for some time, replacing the U.S. dollar as the preferred currency for paying for crude oil. The desire is to respond to challenges posed by Joe Biden’s administration and the economic sanctions that the United States imposes. Speaking to CNBC on whether Bitcoin was an option, Putin stated:   “I believe that it has value, but I don’t believe it can be used in the oil trade […] cryptocurrency is not supported by anything as of yet […] it may exist as a means of payment, but I think it’s too early to say about the oil trade in cryptocurrency.” Russia has been seeking an alternative to the dollar’s dominance in international trade since the U.S. slapped sanctions on Moscow for annexing Crimea. According to Putin, the United States has been using the green buck as a weapon. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts believe that decentralized money like cryptocurrencies could eventually replace fiat currencies issued and controlled by central banks. Putin said:  “I believe the U.S. makes a huge mistake in using the dollar as a sanction instrument […] we are forced. We have no other choice but to move to transactions in other currencies.” Vladimir Putin Sees Value in Crypto, Unsure of Its Role in Oil Trade https://t.co/s1Rk9g2EQI#crypto #CryptoNews #Bullish Russia’s central bank, The Bank of Russia, has consistently warned investors about digital assets’ volatility even though cryptocurrencies aren’t allowed as a payment method in the country. Nonetheless, Russia’s Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev is on record saying the government doesn’t intend to follow China’s footsteps in banning cryptocurrencies. President Putin also mentioned Bitcoin’s massive power consumption as why he’s uncomfortable about their use. There is still a hot debate in most quarters in the crypto community about the amount of power needed to mint new Bitcoins. The United States is currently the leading nation in Bitcoin mining following an influx of “Bitcoin Refugees” fleeing a Chinese cryptocurrency-mining clampdown.  Vladimir Putin’s soft spot for cryptocurrencies has come when Joe Biden’s administration is considering introducing a broad initiative to review cryptocurrency-based policies. China continues with its crackdown on the crypto sphere and banned all crypto transactions in September.    "

The mayor will issue a Request for Proposal later this month to create the payment mechanism that would allow residents to pay fees and taxes in Bitcoin. Mayor Francis X. Suarez has previously expressed his desire to make Miami a clean Bitcoin mining hub since Florida is already leading the charge in the growing popularity of Bitcoin mining in the State. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said it’s “a major priority” for the city to be able to pay employees in Bitcoin: “I want us to differentiate ourselves as a crypto capital of the United States or of the world.” https://t.co/L0eQOlWMni The mayor, a well-known Bitcoin enthusiast, has been working to make Miami a leading crypto hub in the United States since the beginning of the year. The idea that looked far-fetched because the treasury didn’t have direct control over the treasury could soon materialize. According to Bloomberg, Suarez now says he is advancing plans to pay government employees their salaries in Bitcoin besides allowing them to pay their taxes in BTC. Suarez explained:  “I want us to differentiate ourselves as a crypto capital of the United States or of the world.”  Suarez presented a broad proposal to city commissioners last February to allow the city to invest its funds in Bitcoin. However, the proposal didn’t see the light of day since existing Florida statutes didn’t allow local governments to hold such a volatile asset. Suarez deflected a question about whether he was lobbying Tallahassee for a change. He said:   “If we would’ve been able to hold it from the moment that I put the resolution on our agenda, it’d be up by 30 or 40 percent so that I would’ve looked like a genius back then […], but that’s the way it works.” The announcement comes when the United States has become the largest market for Bitcoin mining following China’s ban on cryptocurrencies. Data from Cambridge University reveals the U.S. currently holds a 35.4% market share as miners flee China. Kazakhstan and Russia follow the United States, with market shares of 18.1% and 11%, respectively.  Texas Governor Greg Abbot, a vocal supporter of cryptocurrencies, noted in June the Lone Star State had become the second U.S. state after Wyoming to recognize blockchain and cryptocurrency in its commercial law, paving the way for crypto businesses to operate in the state. Abbot tweeted: It's happening!Texas will be the crypto leader.Cryptocurrency is now coming to Texas grocery stores.H-E-B is putting cryptocurrency kiosks into some Texas grocery stores.#cryptocurrency @HEB https://t.co/e4CNsSbd0s via @chron “It’s happening!

He gave three key factors that he believes will bolster developing nations to join the Bitcoin frenzy. BitMex Cryptocurrency Exchange CEO Alexander Höptner said in a blog spot that the successful adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the dollar in El Salvador has made several other countries interested in following the same path. The move by the Central American country has sparked severe criticism from renowned financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and the mainstream media. Höptner wrote: “What the critics fail to recognize is that developing countries like El Salvador are leading the world in embracing decentralized digital currencies and payments […] my prediction is that by the end of next year, we’ll have at least five countries that accept Bitcoin as legal tender. All of them will be developing countries. Here’s why I think developing countries will jump into crypto in 2022.” According to the CEO, the decision by El Salvador to make Bitcoin in September didn’t mean it was opting out of the established financial system. He said the nation was instead scouting for an alternative that could give its residents and the economy more benefits. He stated:  “They aren’t quite opting out of the monetary system status quo (El Salvador still retains its other legal currency, the US dollar), but they are choosing to try something new. This deserves praise, not derision.” Höptner listed three key factors that he believed would drive the adoption of Bitcoin in developing countries as the reason for his prediction. First, he cited remittances, which made 75% of the $540 billion global remittances in low and middle-income countries according to World Bank data. He explained:  “This money has got to find a way home somehow […] but the current system of remittances – led by money service providers like Western Union – is ripping people off by charging them an average of 10% just to send money home the next business day.” Secondly, he mentioned inflation, which lay between 2.4% and 5.4% for developing countries according to the IMF. According to him, people were bound to look for alternatives during inflation crises. He noted Bitcoin had a solution for that as its supply was capped at 21 million, and developed countries and/or their people noticed. He stated: “As inflation climbed well above 15% this year in Turkey, crypto adoption surged. Turkey responded by quickly banning the use of crypto for goods and services, but inflation is now at 19.25%.” The third factor, according to Höptner, was politics, where he said skilled and technical-savvy politicians were interested in positioning themselves as “progressive, populist, and new age thinkers.” He explained:  “Over the next year, and as El Salvador works out the kinks in its rollout, savvy politicians will be thinking of how they can take a similar path, and how it might benefit both them and their constituents, […] what El Salvador did are take the first leap of faith, making similar moves by other countries much easier to consider.”"
2021-10-08 06:45:15+00:00,Bitcoin Adoption in El Salvador Grows After One Month Despite Technical Setbacks,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-adoption-in-el-salvador-grows-one-month-on-amid-technical-setbacks/," El Salvador became the first country worldwide to make Bitcoin legal tender one month ago. Technical glitches, identity theft attempts, and irregular transactions have plagued El Salvador’s cryptocurrency App. Nevertheless, the Chivo App downloads are soaring. El Salvador made history precisely one month ago by adopting Bitcoin as the country’s legal tender alongside the U.S. Dollar. The President Nayib Bukele Bitcoin Law took effect on September 7, and a lot has happened since then. Adoption has soared even as skeptics continue to ask questions. In the meantime, the government’s official cryptocurrency wallet, the Chivo, has continued to experience technical challenges.  While the citizenry is quickly adopting the use of BTC, only a few businesses in the Central American republic are accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. Other citizens, such as 32-year old construction worker Adalberto Galvez are frustrated by the technical glitches affecting the Chivo App. Galvez claimed he lost $220 while trying to withdraw cash from his Chivo digital wallet. Galvez had already used Bitcoin successfully before at an experimental Bitcoin economy project in the coastal town of El Zonte. He said:  “It took my money but gave me nothing.” Many economists, including global institutions like the IMF, asked questions about the plans for Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador as legal tender. Some questions included whether Salvadorans would download Chivo and the question of volatility or if merchants would accept BTC. However, most of their questions have been answered during the last four weeks since the Bitcoin law took effect.  Despite the teething problems the country has experienced, adoption has been the most significant victory for El Salvador. The country’s President, who has been the force behind the initiative, recently revealed that close to three million people had downloaded the Chivo cryptocurrency wallet App. President Bukele revealed that over 2.1 million Salvadorans were actively using their wallets in September, Apart from the downloads. The president claimed yesterday on Twitter:  Since yesterday, Salvadorans are inserting more cash (to buy #bitcoin) than what they are withdrawing from the @chivowallet ATMs.And if we add remittances (almost $2 million per day), the incoming USD QUADRUPLES the outflow.This is very surprising so early in the game. “Since yesterday, Salvadorans are inserting more cash (to buy bitcoin) than what they are withdrawing from the Chivo wallet ATMs. This is very surprising so early in the game.”  A recent poll by the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development revealed that at least 12% of consumers had used Bitcoin last month. The foundation’s survey involved 233 companies across different sectors and told that up to 93% of businesses were yet to report Bitcoin payments. Leonor Selva of the National Association of Private Enterprises quipped:  “We’re still not sure what benefits the government expected.”  Several small businesses reported benefitting from a $30 bonus offered for downloading Chivo. Alexander Diaz, whose restaurant serving chicken wings saw a spike in business, told Reuters 20% of his customers were using Bitcoin. He said: “Most of the people who received that bonus wanted to test how it could be spent, so several clients made payments to us with Bitcoin.”"
2021-10-07 07:08:06+00:00,U.S. Justice Department Launches National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team,https://blockzeit.com/u-s-justice-department-launches-national-cryptocurrency-enforcement-team/,"The head of the Department of Justice (DOJ) said it was creating two different cryptocurrency enforcement initiatives. The team will help the DOJ better protect consumers from online financial crime.  The U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco announced during a virtual speech at the Aspen Cyber Unit, according to a report on Reuters, that the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team will involve both money-laundering and cybersecurity experts. She said:  “We are today launching the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team. We won’t hesitate to go after laundering platforms and are drawing on cyber experts and prosecutors, and money laundering experts.” Monaco said the team would engage with cryptocurrency exchanges and cryptocurrency projects. It will also target attackers that carry out ransomware campaigns—attacks that hold data hostage and demand crypto payment in return. The team will also target government contractors who do not follow security standards or report security breaches. She said:  “Cryptocurrency exchanges want to be the banks of the future; well, we need to make sure that folks can have confidence when they’re using these systems, and we need to be poised to root out abuse. The point is to protect consumers.” Announcing the development, the Deputy Attorney General said the new civil cyber fraud initiative would “use civil enforcement tools to pursue companies, those who are government contractors, who receive federal funds when they fail to follow recommended cybersecurity standards.” She explained that “for too long, companies had chosen silence under the mistaken belief that it was less risky to hide a breach than to bring it forward and report it. That, she said, was coming to an end. The DOJ’s initiative comes only one week following Joe Biden’s announcement that the U.S. was bringing together 30 countries this month to tackle cybercrime issues, including the “illicit use of cryptocurrencies.” Monaco herself is said to have led the effort that recovered $2.3 million worth of Bitcoin from the Colonial Pipeline hack earlier this year. Cybercriminals often encrypt crucial files of businesses and hold the data for ransom until they are paid an amount in cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have favored hackers’ payment methods to skirt law enforcement, as ownership can be challenging to trace."

The decision is evidence that institutional interest in cryptocurrency is continuing to grow. The top-tier American bank announced its plans to offer cryptocurrency custody services for fund managers. According to the bank’s press release, the service would help investment managers store the private keys or cryptocurrencies from sub-custodian NYDIG.  The crypto custody service will initially involve Bitcoin. The U.S. Bank’s Vice Chair for wealth management and investment services, Gunjan Kedia, said that custody services for Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ethereum, and other assets would likely come over time. Kedia added:  “Our clients are getting very serious about the potential of cryptocurrencies as a diversified asset class […] I don’t believe there’s a single asset manager that isn’t thinking about it right now.” The U.S. Bank has joined a growing list of American banks that continue to join the cryptocurrency craze and consider crypto legitimate assets. The other top-tier banks already offering crypto custody services for their clients include State Street, Bank of New York Mellon, and Northern Trust. American banks started consolidating their interest in custody services in July 2020. The interest resulted from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) letter approving banks to offer the custody service. Before that, only cryptocurrency exchanges such as Gemini, Kraken, and Coinbase offered crypto custody services.  Following the OCC’s approval in 2020 for banks to offer crypto custody services, Kedia said the U.S. Bank noted big investors were “getting very serious about the potential of cryptocurrency as a diversified asset class.” She said that while a few investors already held Bitcoin independently through personal wallets or via trusts, others were waiting for banks they were familiar with to join the crypto frenzy. She stated that most funds were excited by the idea of a Bitcoin ETF specifically, saying, “Some literally want custody contracts signed the day the SEC approves an ETF. She stated: “What we were hearing across the board is that while every currency might not survive – there may not be room for thousands of coins— there’s something about the potential of this asset class and the underlying technology that would be prudent for us to stand up support for it.”  The U.S. Bank’s announcement comes when financial regulators globally, including U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, struggle with overseeing the crypto space. The $2.1 trillion crypto industry has experienced rapid growth in the past years, despite wild price swings and regulatory clampdowns. As we reported, Bank of America analysts began coverage of digital assets on Monday, saying the space is “too large to ignore."
2021-10-05 05:56:25+00:00,Growing Institutional Interest Drives Bank of America into Crypto Research,https://blockzeit.com/growing-institutional-interest-drives-bank-of-america-into-crypto-research/," Bank of America has formed a cryptocurrency research team as it considers to scale its digital asset trading business. The bank’s research will cover payment providers, banks, media giants, and utilities following cryptocurrencies’ massive appetite among institutional clients.  With over 200 million users and a $2 trillion market, the crypto sector was “too large to ignore” the Bank of America said in a press release. This is why in July, the bank formed a specialist research unit to focus on the crypto ecosystem. The bank’s head of Global Cryptocurrency and Digital Asset Strategy Alkesh Shah, stated in a new research note:  “We believe crypto-based digital assets could form an entirely new asset class […] Bitcoin is important with a market value of ~$900bn, but the digital asset ecosystem is so much more: tokens that act like operating systems, decentralized applications (DApps) without middlemen, stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to replace national currencies, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) enabling connections between creators and fans.” Bank of America said it sees crypto and digital assets in a broader perspective as providing enticing investment opportunities via a “variety of lenses.” The bank’s head of Global Research, Candace Browning, said during an interview during Bloomberg TV’s “Surveillance” show that Bitcoin was growing and was now mainstream. She added:  “This isn’t just Bitcoin anymore, this is digital assets, and it’s creating a whole ecosystem of new companies, new opportunities, and new applications […] if you look at the number of corporates mentioning crypto on their earnings calls, that’s gone from about 17 last year to about 147 in the most recent quarter.” Bitcoin has experienced one of its most significant upsurges in recent days following a seeming downtrend a few weeks ago. The other cryptocurrencies have also followed suit, gaining back the ground they had recently lost. This comes only days after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that the American Central Bank wasn’t interested in banning cryptocurrencies.

2021-10-04 06:57:48+00:00,El Salvador Introduces $0.20 Fuel Discount for Paying with Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/el-salvador-introduces-0-20-fuel-discount-for-paying-with-bitcoin/," El Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele is stepping up his efforts to promote the use of Bitcoin in El Salvador. He announced that people will now receive a $0.20 per gallon discount for people who pay for gas with Bitcoin through the Chivo cryptocurrency wallet.  2. La empresa estatal Chivo negoció con las empresas gasolineras más grandes de nuestro país, para que a partir de mañana, sus estaciones vendan cada galón de combustible $0.20 más barato, con @chivowallet.Esto borra varios aumentos del precio internacional de los combustibles. pic.twitter.com/V3qG168isV Last Friday, the El Salvadorian President announced that local fuel consumers could enjoy a $0.20 per gallon discount in fuel prices when paying with cryptocurrency. The President said via a Twitter announcement the subsidy was “positive news for the pockets of El Salvadorians.” Bukele stated:  “The state company Chivo negotiated with the largest gas station companies in our country so that starting tomorrow, their stations will sell each gallon of fuel $ 0.20 cheaper, with Chivo wallet.” According to the posters announcing the rebate, the $0.20 fuel discount will run from September 30 to at least October 14, 2021. Any local company, public transport company, or ordinary El Salvadorian will qualify for the benefit if they use the Chivo wallet. The President said there was no limit to the discount, adding that the $0.20 fuel discount would erase “several increases in the international price of fuels” and “reduce transportation costs in supply chains.” Bukele added:  “If there are reductions, they will be transferred directly to the price of LPG cylinders (of all existing brands in our country) to consumers.”  Some El Salvadorians, however, are still skeptical about the whole subsidy issue that would ultimately benefit ordinary citizens. Twitter user Adan_3840 quipped:  “Those 20 cents will come from all of us, right? The gas station does not lose; there goes the refund after paid with the taxes of even those who walk on foot.” The Salvadoran President is actively promoting the use and continued education of Bitcoin and the government-backed Chivo wallet app. The President recently announced that over 2 million Salvadorans were actively using the Chivo wallet. 2.1 million Salvadorans are ACTIVELY USING @chivowallet (not downloads).Chivo is not a bank, but in less than 3 weeks, it now has more users than any bank in El Salvador and is moving fast to have more users that ALL BANKS IN EL SALVADOR combined.This is wild!#Bitcoin🇸🇻 However, the decision to legalize BTC as legal tender continues to elicit mixed reactions among citizens and the international community. "

Indeed, two siblings revealed that they earn more than $30K per month mining digital assets.  A 14- and 9-year-old brother and sister duo have recently made headlines for explaining how they are raking in $30,000 per month mining crypto assets.  During the summer, Aanya Thakur, 9, along with 14-year-old brother Ishaan mined three types of cryptocurrency because they “wanted to learn something new about technology – and also make some money along the way.” The kids were recently featured in a CNBC report profiling entrepreneurs. The Thakur siblings claim to mine bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), and ravencoin (RVN). YouTube videos taught Ishaan how to convert his Alienware computer into a mining rig, and the siblings initially mined Ethereum. “Mining for cryptocurrency is similar to mining for gold or diamonds.”  Ishaan and Aanya were so interested in mining that they founded Flifer Technologies with the help of their father. “We liked it so much that we began adding more processors and made $1,000 in our first month,” Ishaan explained. Soon after, they were buying new equipment, like ASIC Antminers and Nvidia RTX 3080-Ti GPUs. According to Ishan “We can process slightly more than 10 billion Ethereum algorithms per second.”  That’s a lot of computing power and no mention is made as to what their electricity bill is per month but crunching numbers like that isn’t cheap. Raj, the duo’s father, did assist in getting the team started and took out a loan to allow the brother and sister team to grow. The Thakur siblings’ story follows the story of the 12-year-old Weird Whales NFT creator who made a few hundred thousand dollars in ether selling his NFT collection. A number of young people have ventured into the world of cryptocurrencies at a young age. A 15-year-old security researcher shared a Ledger hardware wallet exploit he discovered in 2018. A 14-year-old programmer created an uncensorable voting platform. The Texas brothers and sisters who founded Flifer Technologies explained that they mine cryptocurrency using “100% renewable energy.” “We moved my desk to the garage because the house was getting too hot and noisy,” the Thakur siblings explained. They soon moved the operation out of the garage and into a downtown Dallas data center. While the brother-sister team claim to be making $30,000 a month, between electricity bills and the rent paid to a professional grade data center, one would think that their overhead is significant. The aforementioned Nvidia rigs cost in excess of $5,000 each (and they have 40 of them), so these kids either have deep pockets or a rich father. What do you think of these minor miners? Does this inspire you to put your kids to work mining crypto in their bedrooms or perhaps doing it yourself? Leave us a comment below. "

This will be the first crypto investment fund to receive a green light according to Swiss law.  The crypto investment fund was launched by Swiss asset manager Crypto Finance and administered by PvB Pernet von Ballmoos AG, an investment manager, and custody by regulated custodian SEBA Bank AG. Swiss markets watchdog approves first crypto assets fund https://t.co/y6sZMxY5yc pic.twitter.com/5D7sXAE4ce  The financial regulator made it clear that the Crypto Market Index Fund could only make investments in the leading cryptocurrencies as they had a “sufficiently large trading volume.” As per Crypto Finance, the fund will monitor the efficiency of the Crypto Market Index 10, a product administered by the SIX Swiss Exchange. Crypto Finance said:  “The objective of the Crypto Market Index 10 is to reliably measure the performance of the largest, liquid crypto assets and tokens and to provide an investable benchmark for this asset class.” Concerning the fund’s potential risks, FINMA explained it approved after closely examining the specific requirements. According to the institution, only established counterparties and platforms under its regulatory scope could process the investments. FINMA added that it might require traders to speculate solely using established counterparties primarily based in a member nation of the Financial Action Task Force and are topic to corresponding anti-money laundering rules. The financial regulator’s statement read in part:  “In order to facilitate serious innovation, FINMA applies the existing provisions of financial market laws in a consistently technology-neutral way.”  Switzerland is among the leading European countries in terms of cryptocurrencies adoption. The FINMA has a good track record as far as the approval of similar digital asset initiatives is concerned. Last year, Switzerland’s Canton of Zug enabled locals to pay their taxes in Bitcoin and Ethereum. In a different happening, companies such as CoinShares and 21 Shares have launched multiple exchange-traded products on the SIX Exchange."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2021-09-28 15:05:33+00:00,BitPay Partners with Verifone to Take Crypto Payments To The Mainstream,https://blockzeit.com/bitpay-partners-with-verifone-to-take-crypto-payments-to-the-mainstream/," BitPay and Verfirne partner up to make crypto payments mainstream. This means you could soon be using crypto to purchase groceries, clothes, subscriptions, and avail many other transactions. The new partnership could stretch the appeal of cryptocurrency beyond its speculative frenzy and increase its demand.  One of the largest point-of-sale providers globally has announced a partnership with BitPay to enable U.S-based merchants to accept cryptocurrency payments. The initiative that will be implemented later this year will see the expansion of BitPay blockchains to cover crypto payments to Verifone in-store cloud services and e-commerce platforms. According to the announcement, the new crypto payments solution will enable merchants to broaden their customer base to customers who prefer to transact business using cryptocurrencies. BitPay CEO Stephen Pair, Verifone CEO Mike Pulli, and Verifone Head of Alternative Payment Models (APMs) Jeremy Belostock said merchants could accept the crypto payments directly from Verifone without setting up an account with BitPay. The crypto payments are made with native crypto wallets. Pulli added:  “We feel that having crypto available on our terminals will open up more options and opportunities for consumers, which is what Verifone aims to do. This opens up a currency that has never before been seen on a terminal, and we want to be at the forefront of this trend.” The press release said that three cryptocurrency wallets in the testing phase were in the testing phase, including Blockchain.com, BRD, Metamask, and BitPay. The company added that merchants wouldn’t have to stress themselves with any technological input to enable the crypto payments and the wallets. All that merchants will have to do is download software to their in-store point-of-sale (POS) terminals. The firm said:  “When a consumer goes to pay at a physical store, they will see the amount due, and the screen will give them the different options for which crypto wallet to use. They will choose a wallet, and a QR-code will surface. They will then scan the QR-code directly from their blockchain wallet and choose the cryptocurrency they want to play with.” The initiative by Verifone is in a string of recent developments stretching back a few years. The company decided to join the crypto sphere in 2018 when it acquired an investment group led by Francisco Partner. Since then, the firm has continuously broadened its presence in the cloud, which has enabled a range of developments and several software upgrades. Pulli said of the hardware/software configurations:  “We built a foundation on the [Verifone] house of alternative payment methods […], and now we are just building rooms on top of the foundation.”"
2021-09-28 14:26:45+00:00,Dimon Hands: JPMorgan CEO Slams Bitcoin “Fools”,https://blockzeit.com/dimon-hands-jpmorgan-ceo-slams-bitcoin-fools/," Jamie Dimon, the CEO of one of the world’s largest financial institutions, JPMorgan, has once again stated his position on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Dimon declared that anyone who borrowed money to buy Bitcoin was a “fool.” His personal opinion, however, has not clashed with the fact that JPMorgan is now providing its customers with access to six cryptocurrency funds and has even created its own digital ledger token for payments, known as JPM Coin. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, slammed crypto and Bitcoin once more. In an interview with the Times of India last week, the JPMorgan executive argued about the true value of cryptocurrencies and his outlook on the cryptocurrency world. According to Dimon, the recent bull market in cryptocurrencies was caused by a large amount of liquidity in the system, which then leads to speculation. Dimon stated: “I do not purchase Bitcoin. If you borrow money to buy Bitcoin, I believe you are a fool.” This seems a thinly-veiled shot at MicroStrategy CEO and Bitcoin evangelist, Michael Saylor. The head of MicroStrategy has invested heavily in Bitcoin, borrowing $600M to do so. Saylor’s view is that if you don’t invest in Bitcoin you’re an idiot. Yet, out of the other side of his mouth Dimon also acknowledged that the cryptocurrency sector’s value could more than tenfold in the coming years. Talk about your mixed messages! Why wouldn’t you borrow money at close to zero percent interest to buy an asset that is increasing in value? Bitcoin has annualized returns of 230% this past decade. That’s ten times more than the NASDAQ 100 over the same time frame. Dimon was also asked how he believes future regulations will affect cryptocurrencies. While Dimon stressed that Bitcoin was not the company’s primary focus, he did state that he believes governments will regulate Bitcoin at some point. Ironically, Dimon’s personal views on the legitimacy of cryptocurrency and the upcoming regulation of the cryptocurrency market have had no impact on JPMorgan’s business moves into crypto. Indeed, the company is more open to cryptocurrencies now than it was two or three years ago.  The firm announced in August that its customers would be able to access six cryptocurrency-based investment funds (Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust, Bitcoin Cash Trust, Ethereum Trust, and Ethereum Classic Trust, as well as the Osprey Bitcoin Trust). It’s obvious that Wall Street wants to have it both ways. They publicly slam Bitcoin, while at the same time setting up funds to sell it to investors. JPMorgan has even ventured into a native coin of its own. JPMorgan announced the creation of “JPM Coin” in October 2020, a network that would allow its customers to make instantaneous payments using blockchain technology.

Users could also receive their salary as a dollar balance or translate it into cryptocurrency instantly. Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange has announced plans to launch a feature that will enable U.S-based clients to deposit their paycheck directly into their online accounts. The official company blog post announcement said the feature would be available in the next few weeks. According to the release, the firm will allow users to make direct crypto paycheck deposits for any percentage of their paychecks. The company stated:  “Direct deposit coming soon: customers will be able to deposit any percentage of their paycheck into their Coinbase account in crypto or USD.” Cryptocurrency enthusiasts who use the new “Get Paid in Crypto” service could receive their paychecks in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrencies available on the exchange. The users could also receive their payment in USD and spend their funds via the Coinbase debit card. The firm’s customers could also select the option of receiving payments in DAI or USDC and earn interest on them. The blog post said:  “Now, you’ll save time on the extra steps it takes to move money so you can immediately earn interest on your income or earn crypto rewards with your Coinbase Card. Plus, you’ll pay zero transaction fees on direct deposit funds, so you have instant and free access to the crypto-economy.” The paycheck in crypto service aims to eliminate the need for customers to rely on banks to make deposits on their accounts. The exchange users have always complained about tedious and time-consuming bank transfers. The exchange said further it was creating an infrastructure that will enable companies to pay their workers directly in cryptocurrencies.   Users who opt to use the paycheck in crypto feature will, in a few weeks, be able to create and modify direct payment services through a few clicks in the Coinbase app. The company will also create an automatic paycheck distribution feature or provide instructions to enable manual deposits via an employer’s payroll system. Max Branzburg, vice president of product at Coinbase, said in a blog post: “With direct deposit, customers can more easily access our crypto-first financial services and be ready for any trade or purchase […] we’re determined to deliver the most trusted full suite of crypto-first financial services to our 68 million users.” The Coinbase paycheck in crypto service joins other Fintech companies that allow users to deposit their paychecks. They include the stock trading app Robinhood and PayPal, whose clients can deposit their paychecks directly into the platforms."

The firm is also mulling support for non-fungible token authentication.   Twitter announced Thursday it was adding a tipping feature that included Bitcoin payments. The third-party tipping service will enable users to link payment platforms such as Cash App, Venmo. The feature will allow users to show their support by liking tweets besides being able to send money.  According to the announcement, the firm plans to add a verification feature for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The feature is meant to complement the burgeoning trend within the crypto sphere. The company’s article titled “bringing Tips to Everyone” by Twitter’s Staff Product Manager Esther Crawford said cryptocurrencies were in tune with the firm’s philosophy. She stated:  “We want everyone on Twitter to have access to pathways to get paid. Digital currencies that encourage more people to participate in the economy and help people send each other money across borders and with as little friction as possible – help us get there.” While this could be the first time Twitter is announcing official support for Bitcoin micropayments, the firm had already given users a taste of the experience. The firm hitherto allowed users to receive payments via PayPal and other providers. Bitcoin tips were already a hot topic using tipping bots such as Tippercoin, BottlePay, or Dropbit. The bots enabled users to link a Twitter account to the Lightning Network wallet and receive via a simple command. Crawford added the company would launch Android support in the coming weeks:  Starting today, we’re rolling out Tips to everyone on iOS globally and bringing it to people on Android in the coming weeks. 🧵 https://t.co/GXKPSIpWYT “Starting today, we’re rolling out Tips to everyone on iOS globally and bringing it to people on Android in the coming weeks. ???? https://t.co/GXKPSIpWYT  — Esther Crawford (@esthercrawford) September 23, 2021.” Additionally, Twitter said it was exploring adding a feature to support the now popular Ethereum-based non-fungible tokens. The crypto community is already known for adding NFTs as their profile picture on their Twitter accounts, so this would not be a stretch. Witter plans to add an authentication feature to enable creators of popular digital assets to verify their NFT avatars. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is a known Bitcoin bull even though NFTs run on Ethereum. Dorsey has also tipped his hand to a blockchain-based Decentralized Finance platform even though DeFi primarily exists on the Ethereum blockchain. The firm stated:   “We’re excited to soon explore NFT authentication. It’s a way to support creators making this art with a stamp to demonstrate authenticity. By allowing people to directly connect their crypto wallets, they can track and showcase their NFT ownership on Twitter.”"

It is estimated that up to $140 billion worth of unclaimed cryptocurrency is held up due to forgotten crypto wallet passwords.  The self-proclaimed “ethical hackers” have said they are on a mission to help people who have forgotten passwords to their Bitcoin wallets. Chris and Charlie brooks believe thousands of people are sitting on a trove of missing assets just waiting to be recovered. According to the Duo, an estimated between 68,110 and 92,855 seemingly lost Bitcoins could be recovered. Cryptocurrency data firm Chainalysis’ recently revealed that up to 20% of the 18.6 million Bitcoin that has been mined is considered lost since the wallets seem to be stranded. According to the New York Times, the value of Bitcoin that’s unclaimed by owners is equivalent to $140 billion. Chris stated:  “A lot of Bitcoin that’s been lost is lost — but it isn’t irretrievably lost […] we came up with a number of about 2.5% of that lost Bitcoin that we feel could still be recovered […] which is something like USD 3.2 billion.”  A recent survey by Crypto Vantage revealed that at least 40% of cryptocurrency owners said they couldn’t remember their passwords. Those that were unable to find their passwords lost an average of $2,134. Chris and Charlie said they try and figure out how their clients’ minds work before they can help them recover their lost passwords. The pair said the process of cracking a Bitcoin password was more straightforward than most people believe, but it required a lot of perseverance to recapitulate possible password combinations. Charlie explained: “It’s a super straightforward process of compiling a list of their best password guesses […] and the more information they can give, the better because then we can extrapolate on how they create passwords and their thought process behind it.” Charlie, a computer science major in college, has had to put college aside to concentrate on the business revealed “One of our most recent cracks had about $250 000” in a blockchain wallet. Charlie stated:  “This is something I’ve always liked. I would follow along with my dad … Online treasure hunting, it seemed really cool.” The father and son pair advises those new to the crypto sphere to secure their wallets by using custodial cryptocurrency wallets. They said it’s easier to recover your lost digital assets if you lose your password. However, hardcore investors with more considerable sums of cryptocurrency are better off using cold wallets, but remembering your password remains significant. Chris joked:  “Humans are not good at remembering semi-random strings of digits and numbers […] I think we are creative problem-solvers […] white hat ethical hackers.”"
2021-09-16 11:34:31+00:00,Freefall: Crypto All-Stars Down 25% This Past Week,https://blockzeit.com/freefall-crypto-all-stars-down-25-this-past-week/,"According to CoinGecko, some of the industry’s largest cryptocurrencies have dropped by up to 25% in the last seven days. “In terms of Bitcoin, this is a fairly typical market pattern—a sort of correction after a significant bullish period,”  according to Quantum Economics Bitcoin analyst Jason Deane. Bitcoin (BTC), the industry’s flagship cryptocurrency, has dropped 13.6 percent in the last week to $44,604. Despite historic news for the asset, which became legal tender in El Salvador, BTC dropped. To say it another way, in news that should have been great for Bitcoin and altcoins in general, the market tanked instead. The announcement came amid a slew of controversies surrounding Bitcoin, which El Salvador’s President Bukele embraced despite protests and warnings from the world’s largest financial institutions. Despite the price drop, Deane believes that long-term holders and investors should not be concerned. “While this is important for traders looking to profit from short-term volatility, it is largely irrelevant for holders and macro-level investors looking at the bigger, long-term picture and quietly accumulating the asset,” he said. Over the last week, other cryptocurrencies have performed even worse than Bitcoin. One such example is Ethereum (ETH), which is frequently cited as Bitcoin’s main competitor among all other cryptocurrencies. Ethereum has dropped nearly 18.3 percent in the last seven days to $3,227. The price drop for Ethereum also contradicts some of the cryptocurrency’s most recent data. According to a report published by cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, Ethereum was being fueled by the network’s much-anticipated London hard fork upgrade, as well as the resurgent non-fungible token (NFT) market, the majority of which runs on the Ethereum network. Cardano (ADA) has fallen 18% to $2.39, while Dogecoin (DOGE) has dropped 24.9 percent to $0.23. Binance Coin (BNB) has also had a rough week, falling 21% in the last week to a current price of $395. Cardano can’t seem to catch a break. Last week it got hammered in the “flash crash” after El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. This week, after Cardano announced their long-awaited smart contract rollout, the market took another hit, burying any pump that might have happened with their smart contract news.  For overall crypto investing quiet and steady accumulation is the way to go. Now may be a great buying opportunity for those focused on longer time horizons, especially with major cryptos down significantly.

The protesters were expressing anger at the introduction of Bitcoin as legal tender and feared that President Bukele would seek re-election in 2024.  Local news outlet Teleprensa posted videos on social media showing a Bitcoin ATM kiosk on fire amid crowds of protesters. Nuestro periodista @Luis33Tv se encuentra en la Plaza Gerardo Barrios en San Salvador, donde manifestantes han quebrado y quemado equipo instalado en el cajero Chivo para protestar contra el #Bitcoin.🎥 #Teleprensa33 #Nacionales pic.twitter.com/pUnJfHkQMh The BTC machine was among the 200 the government installed after adopting cryptocurrency as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. The machine was defaced with an anti-BTC logo and a sign reading “Democracy is not for sale.” President Bukele wrote on his Twitter account:  “They say the ‘vandalism’ was the work of ‘infiltrators,’ but there has been vandalism in ALL their demonstrations […] and why weren’t there any shouts of ‘stop,’ or ‘Don’t do that?’” The damaged Chivo kiosk is part of the government’s efforts to facilitate the acceptance of Bitcoin as legal tender. The President had said he hoped the Bitcoin ATMs would be everywhere in the country but maintained no one would be forced to use Bitcoin. The Bitcoin rollout has faced resistance by a group calling itself the Popular Resistance and Rebellion Block. The group staged a protest in July while veterans, retirees, disability pensioners, and workers marched the streets of San Salvador in August.  #️⃣ #AHORA | Grandes marchas en El Salvador, contra el presidente Bukele, por el uso del Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/fnsBjQIJ0e While public opinion polls indicate the most people are opposed to Bitcoin becoming an official currency, Bukele says it will help Salvadorans send remittances from abroad. The digital wallet recently became overloaded by the large numbers of users cashing in on the $30 government bonus meant to incentivize its adoption by citizens.  The President recently admitted the three-month rollout was a bit ambitious, but he maintains that the result is worth the effort they were putting in place to address the glitches currently experienced. Bukele announced there were at least half a million people already actively using Bitcoin in the country. While all businesses with the technical capacity must accept Bitcoin payments, citizens are not obliged to use it."

Chances are it’s been overloaded by thousands of Salvadorans cashing in on the $30 bonus the government offered to everyone who installed it.   Salvadorans trying to pay with Bitcoin for goods and services or receive money sent by relatives from the United States are still struggling to finish their transactions. According to Associated Press, the challenge persisted since September 8, when the government officially adopted BTC as legal tender. A customer care attendant at a Chive help center admitted they were still experiencing glitches. The man who identified himself as Kike said:  “The servers collapsed, more than a million people were trying to download the application Chivo wallet.”  Even as the challenges held on in the streets, the El Salvador president has been busy keeping his citizens appraised on the advances of gradually expanding the ability to download the application throughout the day. President Nayib Bukele said via Twitter:  “The idea is to go bit by bit to not saturate the servers with so many enrollments at the same time […] we are still fine-tuning small details.” Admitting the rollout of Bitcoin as legal tender in three months was “too high a challenge,” the El Salvador President said Tuesday morning the technical errors the Chivo wallet faced were 95% corrected. 1. Los errores técnicos de @chivowallet están corregidos en un 95%. En los próximos días estará funcionando al 100%.2. Los 200 cajeros en El Salvador funcionan perfectamente, así como los 50 cajeros en Estados Unidos.3. Hay 51 puntos Chivo funcionando al 100%.Sigue… President Bukele stated the remaining issues would be dealt with within the coming days. He also explained the 200 Bitcoin ATM network was working perfectly. According to him, the Chivo wallet had registered over half a million users, and they weren’t accepting new registrations until the existing errors were fixed. Bukele said on Twitter:  “Getting it all started in three months was too difficult, and we made mistakes, but we are already fixing them, and hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans can already use Chivo without a problem.” The El Salvador President has faced criticism for how Bitcoin was rolled out across the country. However, he said that the newly improved app would be “worth the wait” for Salvadorans who currently don’t have access — and he went on to stress that the use of Bitcoin is entirely optional for consumers."
2021-09-10 07:46:28+00:00,Germany’s Asset Manager Union Investment Adds Bitcoin To Its Offerings,https://blockzeit.com/germanys-asset-manager-union-investment-includes-bitcoin-to-its-offerings/," Taking advantage of favorable crypto laws in the country, the German fund and asset manager has offered investors crypto investment opportunities. The group is already testing a pilot program and will convert a percentage of their funds into BTC. The Frankfurt-based investment arm of the DZ Bank Group is a conglomeration of over 800 cooperative banks with an asset base worth $507 billion. The decision by one of the most significant asset firms in Germany to target institutional investors is the most powerful evidence cryptocurrencies are making an inroad into Europe’s largest economy.    The firm told Bloomberg that the initial BTC offering would comprise a small percentage of their funds and only be available to private investors. Portfolio Manager Daniel Bathe said each fund would be allowed a maximum of only 2% of their total asset. Without giving a fixed timetable, he added the program would commence during the fourth quarter. German investment expert Tim Kreutzmann projected the funds were likely to initially stay well below the 20% mark. He added: “On the one hand, institutional investors such as insurers have strict regulatory requirements for their investment strategies. And on the other hand, they must also want to invest in crypto.” Germany is gradually becoming an epicenter for crypto speculations, especially among institutional players. The country’s lawmakers passed a law on August 2, 2021, that allowed institutions to hold cryptocurrencies. This opened the gateway for a more extensive take-up of advanced resources such as Germany’s annuity reserves. Germany’s financial watchdog, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, encourages blockchain innovation but has always urged caution with cryptocurrencies.   While institutional players are jostling to carve out a niche for themselves in the crypto sphere, individuals seem to have been left behind. A recent poll involving 42,000 people revealed that only 11% of Germans were open to digital assets. While the numbers are higher than the U.K and the U.S.A, Germany still performs better than most European countries. Kamil Kaczmarski, a financial consultant working at Oliver Wyman in Frankfurt, stated: “We are observing an increased interest of mixed fund managers in crypto assets.”"
2021-09-08 12:53:55+00:00,El Salvador Adopts Bitcoin: A Big Mistake Or A Genius Move?,https://blockzeit.com/el-salvador-adopts-bitcoin-a-big-mistake-or-a-genius-move/," As of Tuesday September 7 2021, El Salvador officially made Bitcoin a legal tender. This means that companies have to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. El Salvador is the first country to take this step and other countries are curiously following this experiment. A bold move that could turn out to be genius or an absolute failure.  If everything goes right, El Salvador will successfully implement Bitcoin as legal tender. Companies will accept Bitcoin all over the country. And 70% of the population that does not have bank accounts will now have a digital wallet. As a result, all payment fees for money transfers to foreign countries will be greatly reduced. If all goes right, the government will continue buying Bitcoin. It currently holds 550 Bitcoin and the country will launch a digital currency mining infrastructure that will support the whole country. It appears the discount is ending 🥲Thanks for the dip @IMFNews. We saved a million in printed paper.El Salvador now holds 550 bitcoin.#BitcoinDay #BTC 🇸🇻 In the optimal case, Bitcoin will gain main street adoption, rises in price and will make El Salvador and its people extremely wealthy.  Thus, making a poor country rich in a very short time. Other countries would adopt Bitcoin as legal tender giving Bitcoin more and more credibility. The IMF (International Money Fund) has already criticized El Salvador for this move, saying that Bitcoin is too volatile and risky to become legal tender. The IMF has also stated that they will not work with El Salvador in this matter. However, critics believe that the IMF feels threatened by Bitcoin. They are worried about staying relevant in a world where decentralized digital currencies rule. Lets say that the IMF proves to be right and adopting Bitcoin as legal tender for El Salvador turns out to be a great mistake. What are the risks? The Bitcoin price could plummet and all the money that the El Salvadorians and the government put into it would make the country even poorer. This would most likely mean the end of president Bukele’s presidency. Some critics on Twitter see this scenario happening: Thoughts and Prayers for El Salvador, the first country to become bankrupt from #Bitcoin Another risk is that the El Salvadorians will not use the infrastructure and keep on using US Dollar to conduct payments. Indeed, using Bitcoin will require the El Salvadorians to become more technologically savvy. And lastly, the IMF could be right that Bitcoin is too volatile to use as a legal tender. Volatility could cause people losing money in the short term and scare people off. This could already be seen in the flash crash that happened on Wednesday, September 8th 2021, the actual El Salvadorian Bitcoin day, where Bitcoin plummeted 10% within minutes. Bitcoin has so far not been used for payments in a large scale and was considered to be suited as a store of value. It will be interesting to see how El Salvador will deal with the volatility issue. All in all, president Bukele is taking a big risk. But he is also taking a chance for his people and for himself. If this experiment works out, El Salvador as a country and its people could become incredibly wealthy. Bukele would become a national hero. If it doesn’t, it will probably mean the end of his political career and potential further financial problems for his people. Whatever happens, Nayib Bukele will be remembered for this bold move. For Bitcoin this is a real test. Maybe the biggest ever. If it succeeds as a legal tender, it could turn into a revolution and would soon be adopted by other countries as well. Several Central American and South American countries are in talks about adopting Bitcoin and they are surely taking a close look at El Salvador in the coming months."
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2021-09-07 11:56:08+00:00,El Salvador Blazes The Trail As Bitcoin Officially Becomes Legal Tender,https://blockzeit.com/el-salvador-trails-the-blaze-as-bitcoin-officially-becomes-legal-tender/," The government bought 200 Bitcoin as El Salvador wrote history by becoming the first country to adopt BTC as legal tender. The country’s Congress approved President Nayib Bukele’s bill to embrace cryptocurrency three months ago.  President Nayib Bukele proclaimed Monday night the government holds some 400 Bitcoins that are valued at over $21 million at the current price. Following the announcement, citizens will be able to use Bitcoin alongside the U.S. dollar as legal tender. Bukele was optimistic Bitcoin brokers would buy much more as the deadline approached.  El Salvador just bought 200 new coins.We now hold 400 #bitcoin#BitcoinDay 🇸🇻 President Bukele mooted the plans for using Bitcoin earlier in June. He stated then the country would partner with a digital finance company, Strike, to put the required logistics in place. According to Strike CEU Jack Mallers, at least 70% of the country’s population didn’t operate a bank account. He said:   “They asked me to help write a plan and that they viewed Bitcoin as a world-class currency and that we needed to put together a Bitcoin plan to help these people.”  As per the Bitcoin law, all merchants are expected to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment besides being accepted for paying taxes. Citizens who download the official “Chive Wallet” will receive some $30 worth of Bitcoin as a way to encourage its use.  The government previously installed 200 Bitcoin ATMs in different parts of the country in preparation while the Finance Ministry created a $150 million fund to back transactions at a state-backed bank. The Bitcoin ATMs will facilitate the conversion of BTC to USD and vice versa. Even though President Bukele’s bill was passed with a majority by Congress, there were protests last week by citizens and business owners who were opposed to the whole idea.  In the meantime, Cuba is following on the heels of El Salvador. Cuba’s government said on last week that it plans to recognize and regulate cryptocurrencies for payments. The World Bank was also opposed to President Bukele’s idea and refused to extend assistance citing transparency and environmental concerns. The bank said:  “While the government did approach us for assistance on Bitcoin, this is not something the World Bank can support given the environmental and transparency shortcomings.” Reports indicate the country is drafting a proposal on legalizing cryptocurrencies. Panama and Uruguay are also at different stages of preparing their Bitcoin laws.  El Salvador hopes to use Bitcoin to attract new investments while saving on commissions paid by residents sending remittances working abroad. The country’s Central Bank, the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador, estimates citizens working abroad sent over $5.9 million last year alone.   "

However, most Europeans prefer local government regulation and the creation of national digital currencies.  A landmark Euronews survey by Redfield and Wilton Strategies found that 60% of Europeans opposed the EU’s proposed regulation on crypto assets. The poll involved over 31,000 people covering Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Spain. A majority of the respondents supported creating national digital currencies saying that they would guarantee some form of financial independence from the European Union. According to the survey, Estonians and the people of the Netherlands are the most incredible supporters of governmental regulations coming at 70% and 76%, respectively. Iberians were the biggest proponents of the EU regulation coming at 36%. The lowest figures came from Spain, Latvia, and Poland who polled less than 50%.  The most exciting finding was a growing interest in creating national digital currencies as a way of monetary independence from the European Union. Italy led with 41%, followed by Greece and Estonia at 40% and 39% respectively. The Dutch-led in the group that thought otherwise at 37%.  The European Commission (EC) is trying to put a set of regulations for cryptocurrencies across the European Union. The EC proposed a new set of digital currency laws on September 24, 2020, comprised of legislative proposals for handling crypto assets within the member states. The EC sought to clarify the initiative and said:   “By making rules safer and more digital-friendly for consumers, the Commission aims to boost responsible innovation in the EU’s financial sector, especially for highly innovative digital start-ups.” The global cryptocurrency market is currently valued at over $2.5 trillion and continues to grow. Bitcoin is set to become legal tender in El Salvador and the state of Wyoming, enacting crypto-friendly laws. Institutional actors are beginning to realize that cryptocurrencies are becoming a transformative technology of the present.    With the Euronews poll showing most Europeans prefer home-grown regulations instead of EU regulations, European authorities see it differently. France Central Bank’s head François Villeroy de Galhau believes the EU should create a regulatory framework on cryptocurrencies to remain financially sovereign. He said:  “Whether it is digital currencies or payments, we in Europe must be ready to act as quickly as necessary or take the risk of an erosion of our monetary sovereignty.”  If you enjoyed this article, you might also like following article: For Millennials, Cryptocurrency is the Future of Money Shows Survey"

The SEC chairman wants to see policy frameworks to support crypto innovation and decentralized finance (DeFi) to increase investor protection.  The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman, Gary Gensler, said the cryptocurrency market had become a truly global asset class. He gave his input during a virtual session to the European Parliament on policy recommendations for crypto assets. Gensler said:  “I think the transformation we’re living through right now could be every bit as big as the internet in the 1990s […] […] truly global asset class […] it has no borders or boundaries. It operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.” Gensler, who is seen as a pro-regulation champion, went on to address environmental concerns associated with cryptocurrencies. Finnish politician Eero Heinäluoma remarked the amount of power consumed by Bitcoin miners exceeded the total amount used by The Netherlands and Sweden. That, he said, exceeded “the total greenhouse gas emission reductions of electric vehicles.” Agreeing that Bitcoin’s environmental toll was a challenge, the SEC Chair stated that using the energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) by crypto networks was a game-changer. He observed that the continual use of PoS would eventually make carbon emissions related to crypto a thing of the past, even as cryptocurrency adoption rises.  On DeFi, Gensler hailed Decentralized Finance platforms’ ability to “provide direct access to millions of investors” in the absence of third parties but pointed out that there were still some risks. He emphasized that while crypto and DeFi were still “rife with fraud, scams, and abuse,” there was a need for investor protection for the investing public on those platforms. The SEC chair noted the importance of Stablecoins, saying at least 75% of crypto trading revolved around Stablecoin pairs. He said Stablecoins facilitated “those seeking to sidestep a host of public policy goals,” such as anti-money laundering safeguards and international sanctions. He said:  “You’ve heard about Facebook Diem, but we already have an existing Stablecoin market worth $116 billion.”  The mainstream media scoffed at Nicholas Negroponte in the 1990s when he predicted that people would soon be reading news online instead of buying newspapers. Fast forward three decades, and we could soon see a similar impact thanks to blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Just like the internet, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are driven by technological advances."
2021-08-31 12:45:30+00:00,Bitcoin’s Flaws Have Sparked Innovation and Competition,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoins-flaws-have-sparked-innovation-and-competition/,"According to a Cornell University professor, Bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency, has flaws that have prompted other digital currencies to develop more viable alternatives. It isn’t as anonymous as people believe, and “mining” Bitcoin is harmful to the environment, says Cornell’s Eswar Prasad. It also doesn’t work well as a currency-which is what it was ostensibly designed to do in the first place. One intriguing aspect is that other cryptocurrencies have developed solutions to some of Bitcoin’s flaws, according to Prasad, who previously led the International Monetary Fund’s China division. Bitcoin mining is the energy-intensive process of creating new coins and ensuring the payment network’s security and veracity. The power generated used to validate transactions on the blockchain, as well as the mining process, is “certainly not good for the environment,” according to Prasad.  That’s an understatement. Bitcoin consumes about 80 terra-watt hours of electricity per year-or nearly the same amount as 23 coal-fired power plants. Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced earlier this year that his electric car company will no longer accept Bitcoin as payment due to environmental concerns, causing the price of bitcoin to plummet by 5% in a matter of minutes. Tesla & Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/YSswJmVZhP He has since reversed his position, saying in a recent tweet that Tesla will accept bitcoin in transactions if it can confirm “reasonable” and “clean energy usage by miners.” Miners use custom-built computer “rigs” to solve complex mathematical equations that allow a coin transaction to take place. Miners are paid for their work (in this case) in bitcoin. The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, reports the entire process of creating a Bitcoin requires mind-boggling energy and can consume more power than entire countries such as Finland or Switzerland. On the other hand, Ethereum — the second-largest cryptocurrency that is sometimes viewed as an alternative to Bitcoin — is developing a new method of mining that requires less energy, according to Prasad. It is the underlying mechanism for Ethereum, known as “proof of stake,” that activates so-called “validators” on the network if they can prove that they have ether, or a “stake.” In the end, it should eliminate the need for massive amounts of computing power to validate transactions, and the Ethereum Foundation claims it will use 99.95 percent less energy than before. “That will be much less energy intensive, and it may provide many of the benefits that bitcoin was supposed to provide. It may also make transactions much cheaper and faster,” Prasad added. However, he added, it is not yet there. US law enforcement officials announced earlier this month that they were able to recover $2.3 million in Bitcoin paid to a criminal cyber group involved in the May ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline. FBI agents were able to identify a virtual currency wallet used by the hackers to collect payment from Colonial Pipeline. “Bitcoin has sparked a search for a better alternative. People appear to be on the lookout for a medium of exchange that does not require them to go through a trusted third party like the government or a bank — but it’s not quite there yet,” Prasad said. Bitcoin was supposed to facilitate an anonymous medium of exchange in theory, but “it hasn’t worked,” according to the economics professor. Instead, using Bitcoin to pay for something is “slow and cumbersome,” and the market is extremely volatile, according to Prasad. Bitcoin is prone to large swings in volatility, as evidenced by its 30% drop in a single day last month. “You could take a bitcoin to the store one day and get a cup of coffee. The following  day, you could treat yourself to a lavish meal with the same Bitcoin. As a result, that doesn’t work well as a medium of exchange.” Prasad explained. Bitcoin has value because: However, Bitcoin has become a speculative asset for people who want to see its value rise rather than use it as a payment method, according to Prasad.

2021-08-31 06:16:12+00:00,Anti Bitcoin Protests in El Salvador one Week before Bitcoin Law Takes Effect,https://blockzeit.com/anti-bitcoin-protests-in-el-salvador-one-week-before-bitcoin-law-takes-effect/," Some citizens have taken to the streets to protest against making Bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador. The new law requires all economic agents to accept Bitcoin alongside the U.S. dollar as a form of payment. However, the outbreak of protests shows that some people in the country aren’t convinced the decision is correct. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele proposed the much-debated Bitcoin law; it takes effect on September 7, 2021. Bukele believes that making Bitcoin legal tender is beneficial and will see the country save over $400 million paid annually on transaction fees. The president is convinced BTC would facilitate instant and secure financial transactions. The protestors, which included pensioners and veterans, walked through the streets of San Salvador carrying placards. Most of them expressed their apprehension against the upcoming law and were worried the government would pay their welfare and pensions in Bitcoin instead of the U.S. dollar. The fear of the unknown comes from the feeling that most people aren’t tech-savvy and can’t, therefore, use cryptocurrency.  Stanley Quinteros, a member of the Supreme Court of Justice’s workers’ union, said: “We know this coin fluctuates drastically. Its value changes from one second to another, and we will have no control over it.” According to local media, the protestors’ opposition was based because the law “was imposed on the people without consultation. They carried placards that read: “No To Bitcoin,” “No To Money Laundering,” and “The Working Class Rejects Bitcoin.” Members of the Popular Resistance and Rebellion Block opposed the upcoming law last July citing Bitcoin’s volatility and feared it would be used for illegal activity. The Salvadoran Association of International Cargo Carriers (ASTIC) is also opposed to the Bitcoin move. The association said its members would introduce a 20% surcharge if forced to accept Bitcoin transactions. The El Salvador Bitcoin law takes effect on September 7, 2021. The government promised a $30 bonus in Bitcoin for those who download the official digital wallet. It’s not yet clear whether accepting Bitcoin payments will be mandatory. President Bukele said in June the government would not force anyone to accept Bitcoin payments if they didn’t want to. President Nayib Bukele has already asked the government-owned geothermal electric company to consider offering 100% renewable energy to Bitcoin mining facilities.

The luxury hotel joins Turpial airlines and a growing list of companies that have adopted crypto payments.  For starters, the hotel will only accept Bitcoin and Ethereum. Local media The Blick stated recently; guests could use cryptocurrency for accommodation bills exceeding $218 or 200 CHF. The hotel has selected Bitcoin Suisse, a crypto service provider, and payment service provider Worldline, as their facilitator. All payments made in cryptocurrency will be converted into Swiss francs immediately as soon as payment is confirmed. The Chedi Andermatt General Manager Jean-Yves Blatt explained:  “We have long known that cryptocurrencies also have a future in hotel operations. In the course of the increasing spread and acceptance of cryptocurrency payments, we are proud to be one of the first Swiss luxury hotels to be able to offer our guests cryptocurrencies as a secure means of payment.” The hotel that sits in the heart of the Swiss Alps charges $600 for a double room per night and has 123 rooms offering a spectacular view of the Alps. The plans for cryptocurrency payments started at least four years ago. The hotel was seeking a payment mode that would guarantee secure transactions while avoiding severe price fluctuations.  The Chedi Andermatt joins a list of growing large corporations that have since adopted cryptocurrency payments. These include:  The Hong Kong-based hotel group became the first international hotel to accept payments via digital currencies. The group accepts at least 40 different cryptocurrencies in Madrid, Lisbon, Rome, Bali, and Phuket. The Switzerland-based giant insurance broker started accepting crypto payments last April. The decision to accept Bitcoin payments was in the cards beginning in 2019. The payments made through Bitcoin Suisse are converted instantly into Swiss Francs.  Starbucks allows its customers to use the Bakkt App to make Bitcoin payments for drinks and goods in their coffee chain. Starbucks reports there are at least half a million clients already using the digital payment mode.   PayPal users in the United States and the United Kingdom can now hold, buy and sell using cryptocurrencies. The giant payment processor accepts payments in five leading cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. As more and more businesses start adopting crypto payments, Switzerland continues to trail the blaze as one of the most crypto-friendly countries worldwide. The canton of Zug, also known as the “Crypto Valley,” is home to several blockchain and cryptocurrency startups. The Canton of Zug announced last February it was considering allowing residents to pay their taxes in cryptocurrency.  "

The United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) has announced plans to accept Bitcoin down payments before the end of the year.   A press release in Detroit Free Press stated that the mortgage firm would start to accept Bitcoin later this year before it considers Ether and other cryptocurrencies. The move makes UWM the first firm in the mortgage industry to accept cryptocurrencies. As crypto finally makes initial strides into the world of mainstream use cases such as mortgage payments, the company’s CEO Mat Ishbia said: “We’re going to walk before we run, but at the same time, we are definitely a leader in technology and innovation, and we are always trying to be the best and the leader in everything we do […] that’s something that we’ve been working on, and we’re excited that hopefully, in Q3, we can actually execute on that before anyone in the country because we are a leader in technology and innovation.” The results of a recent survey involving at least 8,000 consumers in the United States gave exciting results. The groups that included current and former Bitcoin enthusiasts and no-coiners showed over 93% of respondents were optimistic about making future crypto payments. Over 59% of the no-coiners revealed they were interested in making crypto payments.  People have used cryptocurrencies to make general purchases in the past. However, the possibility of making mortgage payments will be a game-changer. Ishbia said on Twitter:  “We’ve evaluated the feasibility, and we’re looking forward to being the first mortgage company in America to accept cryptocurrency to satisfy mortgage payments.”  “We are evaluating the feasibility and requirements in order to accept cryptocurrency to satisfy mortgage payments.” – @Mishbia15 The decision by UWM to consider using decentralized cryptocurrencies comes amidst a push to scrutinize cryptocurrencies in the United States. The Joe Biden administration recently introduced a controversial cryptocurrency tax bill to raise $1 trillion for infrastructure projects. There’s already talk among figures like SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and Fed Chief Jerome Powell on cryptocurrency regulation.  UWM did not disclose details on the process of making crypto payments. It’s not yet clear whether the company will accept and convert Bitcoin to fiat during the transaction. Users will be keen to know whether they can make the initial payment in crypto then monthly payments in cash. "
2021-08-24 13:33:51+00:00,El Salvador Sets Up 200 Bitcoin ATMs In Preparation For Impending BTC Rollout,https://blockzeit.com/el-salvador-sets-up-200-bitcoin-atms-publishes-draft-law-for-banks-in-impending-btc-rollout/," El Salvador President has ignored opposition and criticism in his quest for making Bitcoin legal tender in just a few days. The country’s President has published a draft law for the impending enactment of the Bitcoin law and launching a Bitcoin wallet.  El Salvador’s pro-Bitcoin President Nayib Bukele announced via Twitter that the Bitcoin law would be implemented on September 7, 2021. He added that the official government Chivo cryptocurrency wallet would be ready for download on the same day. The country will also open 200 Bitcoin ATMs and 50 Bitcoin Kiosks which residents will use for BTC to USD conversions before making cash withdrawals.  The El Salvador president announced in June that the country was developing a digital wallet. He announced then that all citizens who downloads the app would receive $30 worth of BTC as a bonus. President Bukele reiterated the fact that the Bitcoin plan would save residents money spent on remittances.  The government has encouraged El Salvador residents living abroad to use the wallet app when sending it to their friends and family back home. The President reminded people that they could still use Western Union if they didn’t mind the high commissions and long queues. Saying the digital wallet won’t charge any fees, President Bukele stated:   “Our town pays $400 million (U.S.) a year in commissions on remittances. A Salvadoran abroad will be able to send money instantly to their relative in El Salvador. You can send your Bitcoin (if you want), or you can send your dollars if you want.” The plan by El Salvador to make Bitcoin legal tender has received tremendous support at home but faced stiff opposition from the international community. The World Bank refused to lend a hand toward the implementation of the project. Nonetheless, President Bukele has soldiered on insisting that adopting Bitcoin was an option for willing citizens. Bukele took to twitter to address critics who believed the new law would hurt citizens. He stated:    “Some will prefer to believe the thieving opponents that they have done nothing more than looting our country, destroy it and pay to assassinate our people. Others will decide to believe the government. But in the end, everyone will realize the reality on September 7.” Bukele’s government is sparing no effort to make Bitcoin adoption a reality. The country’s Central Bank – Banco Central de Reserva (BCR) – has published a draft of regulations focusing on commercial banks’ conduct on Bitcoin distribution. The draft bill states that any bank willing to use BTC must follow the laid down regulatory processes. According to the regulations, the Central Bank (BCR) will:  “Have access in real-time to all information related to the operations carried out, as well as information requested by clients.”"

Research by Finder.com shows the significance of cryptocurrencies in facilitating remittances and financial inclusion.  The latest survey by the financial product comparison website across 27 countries in the Americas, Asia, and Europe showed at least 41 percent of participants had bought a digital asset. Vietnam had 20 percent of respondents who had made a purchase using Bitcoin. The number was the highest among the 42,000 respondents that participated in the study.  The Southeast Asian country may be the 53rd largest economy globally, but as of June 2021, it ranked 13th in terms of cryptocurrency gains. As per the Finder.com report, remittances were a leading, motivating factor for crypto adoption. The statement read in part:   “Remittance payment may have played a significant role in these numbers, with cryptocurrency an option for migrants who want to send money home and avoid exchange fees.” The report showed countries in the Asian sub-continent remained first among equals in cryptocurrency adoption. India and Indonesia followed Vietnam, with at least 30 percent of the respondents saying they had bought some digital assets. Malaysia and The Philippines followed at 29 percent and 28 percent, respectively. The adoption rate was lowest in the developed countries. The United Kingdom stood at 9 percent while the United States had an 8 percent adoption rate.  The report showed cryptocurrency adoption rates were significantly higher in Latin American countries. At least two cryptocurrency exchange startups in Latin America are valued at over $1 billion. Brazil reported a 22 percent rate of respondents who had used Bitcoin to make a purchase. The survey polled between 1,160 and 2,511 people in every participating country. The report explained:    “Due to the varying Google infrastructure in each territory, not all surveys were nationally representative.” A local Vietnamese media outlet recently showed blockchain was an emerging technology in the country. The report indicated the nascent technology was poised to play a leading role in the country’s plan toward digitization. The country’s Prime Minister nudged the country’s central bank, The State Bank of Vietnam, to explore a central bank digital currency (CBDC).  Vietnam PM Phạm Minh Chính asked the central bank to consider issuing a CBDC built on the blockchain instead of a shared ledger. He gave the bank a 2021- 2023 timeline. Chính intends to create an efficient e-government built on big data, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and augmented reality. Local financial expert Huynh Phuoc Nghia believes digital money is an inevitable trend. "
2021-08-10 14:45:50+00:00,Why China Pushes Their Digital Yuan Over Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/why-china-pushes-their-digital-yuan-over-bitcoin/,"Of all major economies, China has the most advanced central bank digital currency program. What distinguishes the digital yuan from Bitcoin? Over 80 governments (representing 90% of global GDP) are now exploring or testing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Only five countries have CBDCs as of July 2021. Saint Kitts-Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Lucia, and Grenada. The digital yuan, also known as the e-RMB or the Digital Currency, Electronic Payment (DCEP). Here we’ll get into the digital yuan and compare it to the OG cryptocurrency: Bitcoin. In China, the CBDC is a digital version of the renminbi (hence, e-RMB). CBDCs are like stablecoins, which are pegged to a fiat currency 1:1. So the digital yuan is just a digital version of China’s physical currency, held in a mobile wallet rather than a pocket. Each physical banknote and each digital yuan token issued by the central bank have a unique identifier. Unlike cryptocurrencies, CBDCs do not use decentralized blockchains, as the central bank retains control over the ledgers. More on that later. The digital yuan has been in beta since April 2020. The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) began airdropping millions of digital yuan to citizens in October 2020 to test the technology and generate buzz. That continues till July 2021. The digital yuan may already be spent at a growing number of businesses, including Walmart. PBoC reported in July 2021 that the digital yuan had been utilized in 70.75 million transactions, worth $34.5 billion. The digital yuan will thereafter be widely used during the February 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. This includes overseas guests.The U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee has been requested to restrict athletes from using the digital yuan because it “may be utilized to spy Chinese people and anyone visiting China on an unprecedented scale,” according to Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY). In an April 2020 article in the state-run news outlet Yicai Global, deputy governor Fan Yifei argued that physical money is expensive to manufacture and maintain, easy to counterfeit, and anonymous. The digital yuan solves these issues. The project’s major motivation appears to be lowering cash’s anonymity. After all, the Chinese Communist Party has created the world’s largest surveillance state. Former PBoC digital currency institute head Yao Qian claimed in May that the bank does not intend to monitor all transactions in real-time. To track anyone and everything, the Chinese government has deployed millions of facial-recognition cameras across the country to keep tabs on all transgressions, including small offenses like jaywalking. A digital yuan might easily fit into this surveillance system, charging the jaywalker’s digital wallet. China has often hinted at adding blockchain-related terminology into the digital yuan. But decentralization isn’t on the list. Both Bitcoin and the digital yuan enable peer-to-peer payments. In reality, that’s the only similarity. Since Bitcoin is built on a blockchain, it solves the problem of double-spending, and the digital yuan works more like cash than bank-connected digital money transactions. It matters since 84 percent of Chinese people already use a mobile wallet-compared to less than 41 percent of Americans. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, WeChat Pay and Alipay account for about 90% of China’s $35 trillion mobile payment market. Banks, for example, are private financial middlemen. The digital yuan alters this. (On a personal note, I use WeChat for virtually all payments and money transfers in Shanghai. I rarely hold paper money and can’t remember the last time I was in a bank. It’s the same for most everyone I know.) Contrarily, the digital yuan is predicated on the concept of “One Coin, Two Addresses, Three Centers.” The government lacks control over how, where and how much paper money is spent in China. This was somewhat solved with services such as WeChat and Alipay which are tied to Chinese banks. A digital yuan would potentially give the government the ability to further monitor citizen activities and movements of money. The digital yuan will be used daily. The government would closely monitor its price to ensure it accurately reflects the national currency, preventing traders from profiting from arbitrage or investors from hoarding it. Aside from being banned in China since 2017, Bitcoin has never been used as a medium of trade. To date, not much has changed. However, due to low electricity costs, China has historically had the highest global percentage of Bitcoin miners (75.5% in September 2019). In May 2021, the Chinese government stated that it needed to “avoid and control financial risks.” Of course, that logic aligns with the digital yuan’s larger goals. In other words: Bitcoin bad. Digital yuan good! The global share of Chinese miners had already dropped to 46% in April 2021, indicating the trend had begun before the government’s crackdown. With Yunnan, Anhui, and Qinghai province outlawing Bitcoin mining (allegedly to cut carbon emissions!), with practically all mining activity in China halted in June of this year. "
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2021-08-09 08:04:48+00:00,Crypto Community Condemns Joe Biden’s Planned Infrastructure Bill,https://blockzeit.com/crypto-community-condemns-planned-cryptocurrency-tax-rules-in-joe-bidens-infrastructure-bill/,"Cryptocurrency lovers, including Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk, Brian Armstrong, and Ted Cruz, have condemned Joe Biden’s proposed crypto tax regulation. The infrastructure bill that is close to being passed by a bipartisan U.S. Senate aims to raise $28 billion from crypto taxes.  A rare cooperation between Democrats and Republicans sneaked in a bill that tightens tax compliance within the crypto sphere. The critics argue that the effort was rushed. They singled out the part that declares someone “responsible for and regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets” to be a broker, subjecting them to tax reporting requirements. They argue the definition is so ambiguous that it could force cryptocurrency miners, developers, and all digital asset companies to gather user information. This, they say, is impossible in the Decentralized Finance system. Sen. Ted Cruz stated on Saturday:    “The infrastructure deal contains DANGEROUS provisions that would devastate crypto and blockchain innovation.” Coinbase, Square, Ribbit Capital, and several other stakeholders wrote a joint protest letter warning of the unintended outcomes on cryptocurrency developers and miners. Privacy-minded digital rights organizations Fight for the Future, and Electronic Frontier Foundation added their voices to the condemnation.  We stand with @Square, @RibbitCapital, @coincenter, and @BlockchainAssn about the digital asset provision in the infrastructure bill. And we applaud @ronWyden @senLummis @senToomey in proposing a thoughtful amendment to get the tech right.Read our official statement ↓ pic.twitter.com/YrkohsDny7 After the outcry by the cryptocurrency community, several influential senators proposed an amendment to clarify the new reporting rules. Senators Ron Wyden and Pat Toomey have proposed an amendment to clarify the reporting regulations. While I appreciate that my colleagues and the White House have acknowledged their original crypto tax had flaws, the Warner-Portman amendment picks winners and losers based on the type of technology employed. That’s horrible for innovation. The amendment clarifies that blockchain technology and wallet developers would get included in the bill. The two senators want Bitcoin miners, network validators, and other providers exempted from the requirement to report to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong argued the move was guaranteed to go wrong as the government was “trying to pick winners and losers in a nascent industry today.” He appealed to senators via Twitter to support the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment and keep the crypto industry thriving.

Diners who download the Bakkt App and pay for their meals using Bitcoin will receive an equivalent of $15 in BTC as a reward.     According to an August 3, 2021 press release, Bakkt Holdings, in partnership with Quiznos Sandwich chain, will roll out a program that allows diners at Quiznos to pay for their meals using cryptocurrency. The pilot program that begins in mid-August will include several high-traffic locations, such as at the Denver Airport. Commenting on the significance of adopting crypto-based payments, Bakkt Chief Revenue Officer Sheela Zemlin said:   “This is an exciting tentpole moment for us as we connect the next generation of customer experiences to the digital economy […] through this partnership; we are introducing unique experiences to Quiznos customers by enabling them to take advantage of new ways to interact with digital assets and bringing Bitcoin utility to the mainstream consumer market.” Bakkt will evaluate the performance of the pilot program before expanding the partnership to other Quiznos restaurants across the United States. Mark Lohmann, the president of the REGO Restaurant Group that owns over 216 restaurants and other Quick Service Restaurant chains, believes the partnership will benefit their company. He stated:     “As we continue our digital transformation journey and respond to mobile and millennial consumer demand for alternative and cryptocurrency payment options, we are excited to offer yet another accessible way for customers to buy a meal, in this case, through the Bakkt digital asset wallet.” Bakkt entered the crypto sphere as a futures trading platform targeting institutional investors. The firm after that expanded to include an international exchange. Bakkt engages in partnerships that create innovative ways to make cryptocurrency payments a viable alternative for everyday activities. Merchants and franchises that partner with Bakkt enable their customers to make payments using cryptocurrency. Since they launched their App last April, Bakkt has roped in other institutions besides Quiznos to facilitate Bitcoin payments. Starbucks’ customers can now use their digital wallets to reload their cards. Similarly, the over 3.5 million GolfNow members can make crypto payments, convert it to cash, or use Bitcoin with reward and loyalty points. Bakkt aims to empower and strengthen its partner network by leveraging crypto-based solutions to provide flexibility and a hassle-free customer experience.   "

El Salvador President Nayeb Bukele highlighted in a tweet on Sunday, August 1, 2021, the different advantages that Bank of America sees for El Salvador. The President shared a screenshot of an economic outlook report by the bank’s analysts that gave El Salvador a Statement of Approval for choosing the world’s leading cryptocurrency.  Some of the opportunities @BankofAmerica sees with El Salvador’s #Bitcoin adoption: pic.twitter.com/5E63FM4TAF The July 26, 2021 report explored the Central American republic’s overall economic viewpoint, with the highlighted section extensively explaining the opportunities available in terms of remittances, business operations, and digitization. The reports’ authors believe that the adoption of cryptocurrency would help with all the aspects mentioned above. The analysts, who included Latin American strategist Claudio Irigoyen, stated: “Bitcoin could be used as an intermediary for cross-border transfer … Using Bitcoin for remittances could potentially reduce transaction costs compared to traditional remittance channels […] We disagree with the notion that it is coercive that businesses will be legally bound to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment as long as they have the proper technological infrastructure.” According to the report, remittances formed at least 24% of El Salvador’s GDP. Using Bitcoin as a means for cross-border transactions could be a game-changer due to its ability to cut transaction costs, meaning that citizens would remain with the lion’s share of every dollar they transmitted. With over 70% of the citizens lacking bank accounts, the report also stated that a Bitcoin-based economy would be the best way to include everyone else in the economy. With banking the unbanked being touted as a huge selling point for cryptocurrencies, the BoFA report pointed out the Bitcoin adoption would greatly benefit digitization.  Additionally, the Bank of America report explained that Bitcoin adoption would lead to an immense inflow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as the country becomes a magnet attracting cryptocurrency ATM manufactures, Bitcoin miners, and payment platforms, among others. That could spur the country’s economic growth besides attracting local and foreign entrepreneurs.   As Blockzeit reported recently, the Congress in El Salvador on June 9, 2021, approved President Bukele’s Bitcoin Law Bill regarding Cryptocurrency, making the Central American country the first one in the world to classify Bitcoin as legal tender. The approval was welcomed with rejoicing by the wider global Cryptocurrency industry.       "
2021-07-31 14:01:48+00:00,Will MicroStrategy Ever Stop Accumulating Bitcoin?,https://blockzeit.com/will-microstrategy-ever-stop-accumulating-bitcoin/,"MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor some would argue is Bitcoin’s biggest fan. Nobody buys the dip as much as Michael Saylor does. And just last night, MicroStrategy revealed that they plan to add to their Bitcoin position despite losses in quarter two of 2021.  Microstrategy had a good software quarter, but who cares. As of June 30, 2021, the carrying value of MicroStrategy’s digital assets (comprised of approximately 105,085 bitcoins) was $2.051 billion, which reflects cumulative impairment losses of $689.6 million since acquisition. MicroStrategy, the largest independent publicly traded business intelligence company, released their second quarter revenue on Thursday evening. The company reported a loss of nearly $700 million in the second quarter of 2021 (April-July). As of the end of the second quarter of this year, MicroStrategy revealed that the companies digital acquisitions amounted to around 105,000 Bitcoins. This equates to just over $2 billion dollars in Bitcoin. And although MicroStrategy has taken losses throughout the second quarter like nearly all institutions and retail investors involved in crypto, the company made it very clear that they have no intention of selling. In fact, they revealed that they will continue to add to their Bitcoin portfolio. A quote from the company’s report that was released on Thursday night said: “We continue to be pleased by the results of the implementation of our digital asset strategy. Our latest capital raise allowed us to expand our digital holdings, which now exceed 105,000 bitcoins. Going forward, we intend to continue to deploy additional capital into our digital asset strategy.” Sailors’ enthusiasm for Bitcoin has helped to keep the market afloat during this bear cycle. And some cite Saylor as the most important figure within the market. However, Saylor has made it clear that he won’t take all of the credit. In a recent interview with CNBC, Saylor said: “Bitcoin is enormously appealing to those looking for economic security right now. And that’s an incredibly powerful trend. The company is benefiting from that ground swell of support for Bitcoin.” But Saylor will continue to be an integral part of the Bitcoin community as he revealed in the interview from above. Saylor said that MicroStrategy will continue to buy Bitcoin even though the company is almost $2 billion dollars in debt. Despite the debt of the company, MicroStrategy is a profitable software venture and Saylor will continue to buy the dip with the company’s cash flow. MicroStrategie’s dollar cost average for their Bitcoin Position is reported to be around $19,000 which is half as much as today’s price. So, all in all, the company is doing well despite recent losses.

Bitcoin has started to gain new momentum after hitting a monthly low of $29,000 last week. The reason for this reason surge appears to be a short squeeze, as several short positions had to be covered. Short squeezes can result in big price jumps, as investors who are betting against Bitcoin have to buy back Bitcoin to cover their positions. Furthermore, there has been good news on the crypto market as Amazon appears to be looking into accepting crypto later this year. And then Elon Musk announced last week that he himself, Tesla and SpaceX hold Bitcoin and other crypto positions and that Tesla is looking to accepting Bitcoin again now that miners are working towards making Bitcoin more green. The Bitcoin price is still slightly below the the monthly high of $39,800. The positive news on Bitcoin has given Bitcoin some nice momentum, however, it is likely that new short positions will be opened in this area that could hold up the price. Mr. Whale, the number 1 crypto writer on Medium has been predicting exactly this scenario. He announced on Twitter when Bitcoin hit a monthly low of $29,000 last week that he expects a bounce in price and then a larger drop in what is called a bulltrap in the financial world. Bitcoin will eventually tank again, and fall to yearly lows. This bounce is a fake-out rally and is aimed at luring people in for the next big rug pull.I warned about this pump last week, and it's aging perfectly. We aren't going to all-time highs.Control your FOMO. 🐳 Time will show if he is right. This recent Bitcoin rally brings a breather for the entire crypto market, as most of the Altcoins followed Bitcoins price increase. Ethereum is up 8% at $2300, Cardano (ADA) climbed back to $1.39."
2021-07-22 11:57:06+00:00,Charles Hoskinson Says Ethereum Will Defeat Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/charles-hoskinson-says-ethereum-will-defeat-bitcoin/,"The argument that Ethereum will take over Bitcoin as the number 1 cryptocurrency has been around for a long time. And one of the people who thinks this will happen is Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano. Hoskinson thinks that Bitcoin is a religion and has issues. Hoskinson sat down recently in conversation with podcaster Lex Fridman to discuss his thoughts on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano and more. In the podcast Charles Hoskinson said: “If I had to bet between just those two systems, I’d say nine times out of ten Ethereum is going to win the fight against Bitcoin.” Hoskinson is the founder of Cardano who visited the Miami Bitcoin Conference where he said that he had a toilet paper roll thrown at him. He criticized the Bitcoin culture being “religious” and not willing to adopt new ideas. Hoskinson came in hard with his criticisms about Bitcoin. Hoskinson believes that Bitcoin’s proof of work system needs an upgrade. He praised Ethereum’s decision for changing to a proof of stake network and countering one of the major drawbacks of the Ethereum network. In regards to Bitcoin’s issues, Hoskinson said: “There’s fundamental improvements that could actually make Bitcoin an incredibly competitive system. Like if they wanted to keep Nakamoto concensus proof of work, there’s ways to enhance proof of work. I mean, Concierge did this with Bitcoin Ng and Promoto Veswanas did this with Prism. You could make it 10,000 times faster and you don’t compromise the fundamental security functions of the system.” Charles explained that he believes Bitcoin has lost it’s value proposition because of its inability to change and grow. He used his own company, Cardano as an example of something with a strong value proposition. He said his goal with Cardano is to make money accessible to anyone in the world no matter if they’re rich or poor. However, he doesn’t see anything special about Bitcoin anymore. He said: “I can’t think for the life of me what is the point in Bitcoin.” Hoskinson spoke highly of Bitcoin in the early days. He said he really enjoyed the early Bitcoin conferences back before 2013 when people cared more about creating a financial movement versus what he now calls a religious movement of sorts. Charles Hoskinson would like to see improvements in the Bitcoin protocol to become a fan again. But he thinks the future of both Cardano and Ethereum look bright.

2021-07-22 08:00:47+00:00,Turkey To Introduce New Crypto Regulations,https://blockzeit.com/turkey-introduces-new-crypto-regulations/,"Government authorities in Turkey are drafting new legislation to facilitate new laws for the nation’s crypto industry. The laws are to be introduced to Turkish parliament this fall and will institute taxes for crypto investments and for companies using digital assets to run their company. Turkey isn’t the fist country to introduce crypto regulation. Many of the reasons Turkey is regulating crypto are for the same reasons that China has banned it and law makers in the U.S. have regulated it. This includes protecting investors from risks, and preventing criminal activity. Şakir Ercan Gül, the Deputy Minister of Treasury and Finance, said: “Those that ban [cryptocurrencies] are generally countries with democracy problems. There are free mechanisms in Western Europe and America.” Government officials in Turkey plan to initiate taxes for crypto above a certain amount. Government regulators will assess numerous ways of taxation. For example, making it required that all crypto investors report selling of crypto above a given value to the tax office of Turkey. So, it seems like the Turkish government is taking an opportunity to cash in on the trillion dollar crypto industry. But some of the government’s concerns are real. With the Lira continuing to plummet and gold not available in Turkish markets, investors in all industries in Turkey have not had an easy time making profits on their businesses and investments. This means that there’s a lot of opportunity for fraudsters in Turkey’s crypto market. However, one scammer in particular has lucked out due to failed legislation on part of the Turkish government. Faruk Fatih Ozer, the founder of a domestic crypto exchange, escaped to Albania with $2 billion he made after a fundraising round from investors. The Turkish government says that they want to regulate crypto to protect investors from this kind of fraud. However, the Turkish government has outlawed the exchange of digital assets for goods and services. Even if Ozer was arrested, the money he stole would not be able to be returned anyway. So it appears that Turkish officials are causing more issues than they are solving. While they claim they want to institute laws to protect investors – in reality, they are creating a disastrous situation. The new bill which officials are working on will be presented to Turkish Parliament in October. But while the government claims these laws will help investors, their past actions are raising concerns among many in Turkey’s crypto industry.

Many in the crypto world are not fans of Tiktokers so they found this amusing. And his tweets received replies from big names including the founder of Twitter Jack Dorsey. Also, Global Macro investor Raoul Pal. Pal is significant because he is one of the world’s leading experts in crypto and investing. And these are only a few people. No doubt Busta Rhymes will have more than enough resources to educate himself. Busta Rhymes is in fact so interested in crypto education, that he brought up the idea to teach crypto in school. We have a whole set of free educational resources (videos, books, research, courses, podcasts, leaders, corporate) posted on the website https://t.co/kZl3k7Tm4h. #Bitcoin is hope. 🚀 However, Busta Rhymes isn’t the first person to introduce this idea. In fact, it’s already been happening in some places. An article on NBC from more than three years ago reported that Union Catholic high school in the U.S. began teaching its students about crypto currencies. The school’s motto is: “Where Tradition Meets Tomorrow.” And they seem to be fulfilling their motto by educating young people in the cutting edge world of Fintech. No doubt Busta Rhymes will have an influence on young people also being a popular artist. This seems like a great catalyst for more crypto education. Hopefully it pays off. Michael Saylor certainly seems to think it will as he gave a thoughtful response to Busta Rhyme’s inquiry. Busta Rhymes isn’t the only celebrity to speak about crypto either. Which do you prefer, BTC or ETH? Veteran boxing champion Mike Tyson has been keeping an eye on the market as well. Mike’s tweet above also received responses from many of the same influencers and celebrities has Busta Rhyme’s tweet did. And Busta Rhymes isn’t the only rap star to express his interest in crypto. Snoop Dogg made a pun in a tweet a few months ago with his name as Snope Doge – and rapper Nas has been in the industry all the way back since 2013. Eight years ago, Nas’s investment firm, QueensBridge Venture Partners, entered a Coinbase fundraising round back when the company was worth just over $140 million. Today, Coinbase is valued over one billion. Even though the market is rather boring right now, there are still many exciting things happening in the industry now as Wave Jumper points out below. Big Players like Grayscale and Mark Cuban are buying the dips. And Mark Cuban is still bullish on crypto even after losing a lot to Iron Finance.

The UK court ruled in his favor. Craig wright wins Cobra bitcoin case by default pic.twitter.com/btYISK8YJx During the court hearing, Wright accused Cobra, the founder of Bitcoin.org, of copyright infringement. Additionally, Cobra has been ordered to pay the sum of 35,000 in pound sterling. The judge also gave Cobra an ultimatum to never again break the copyright law against Wright. The Judge accused Cobra of not defending himself which Cobra claims is untrue. Although Cobra did not show up to the case, he claims that he wrote to the judge multiple times to persuade the judge to drop the case. Cobra took to Twitter and said publicly how he feels about the case. He lambasted the English judicial system and accused them of only siding with Wright because of financial incentive to do so. He said that the UK Justice system does not care about siding with who’s on the right side of the law, but instead who has the biggest wallet to pay them. However, the most crucial point he made was when he said: I don’t think you could get a better advertisement of why Bitcoin is necessary than what happened today. Rules enforced through cryptography are far more superior than rules based on whoever can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in court.” When Cobra was asked why he did not attend the hearing, he said: “No. I didn’t show up because defending against nonsense is a waste of time.” This all began in the beginning of 2021 when Wright warned Bitcoin.org to remove the whitepaper off of its site. Wright informed Bitcoin.org that he would take legal action if they failed to do so. However, Bitcoin.org did not concede to the will of Wright. Wright followed through with his promise in April after being granted authority to serve Cobra despite being outside the UK’s jurisdiction. Now, Bitcoin.org must publish a transcript of the court order on the website. Additionally, the court will continue to assess for “further damages” by Cobra in opposition to Wright. Although Wright claims to be Nakamoto, the true identity of Bitcoin’s creator has yet to be revealed. There is no evidence that Wright has to substantiate his assertion. Therefore, it appears Cobra is correct about the court’s ruling. But the broader point that Cobra makes is more significant. He says that it doesn’t matter who Nakamoto is. Because Bitcoin is bigger than one person according to Cobra. He believes that it transcends that, and even though Wright won the court case, Cobra believes Bitcoin still is controlled by the people."
2021-07-12 17:06:54+00:00,George Soros Investment Fund Gave Thumbs Up To Trade Bitcoin Products,https://blockzeit.com/george-soros-investment-fund-gave-thumbs-up-to-trade-bitcoin-products/,"New information has been revealed by anonymous sources reveals that Dawn Fitzpatrick, the CIO of George Soros’s investment fund gave a thumbs up for the fund to trade Bitcoin products. George Soros has been no friend to Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in the past. Three years ago at the World Economic Forum in Davos he said that cryptocurrency is a bubble of misinformed people. He stated: Bitcoin is not a currency. A currency is supposed to be a stable store of value. And a currency that can fluctuate twenty-five percent in a day can’t be used, for instance, to pay wages because wages could drop twenty-five percent in a day. So, it’s a speculation based on a misunderstanding.” Although the price of Bitcoin fluctuates like Soros says, this is true of any currency. But many Bitcoin proponents believe that the price of Bitcoin will go above $1 million. Bitcoins characteristics as a store of value is the reason why it is looked upon by many as digital gold. Soros has not made any public statements since this time that indicate wether his opinion has changed or not. In March, Dawn Fitzpatrick told Bloomberg she finds Bitcoin to be an interesting asset. She said: “It’s a really important moment in time and that while Bitcoin could have stayed a fringe asset, the money supply surging had given it a clear purpose. So, there’s a real fear of debasing fiat currencies. And when you think about Bitcoin, I don’t think it’s a currency. I think it’s a commodity and it’s a commodity that’s easily storable. It’s easily transferable. The IRS classifies it as a physical asset, it has a finite amount of supply, and that supply is halved every four years. So I think it’s interesting.” Although some might be ecstatic to see all of these hedge funds and financial institutions promote Bitcoin, it’s important to recognize their intentions. For example, in the early 90s Soros became notorious for nearly shorting the British pound out of existence. Maybe that sounds like an exaggeration, but subsequently Great Britain drew out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. So, he must have done some damage. The point above being made is that who is to say that Soros won’t attempt the same shorting stunt with Bitcoin? After all there are far less regulations in the crypto market than there were in the foreign exchange market at the time of Soros’s big short. People should keep a cautious eye on Soros and other big players who have enough money to heavily manipulate markets.

2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."

The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."

I have tried and tried and tried to find something ""good"" in this. And I have failed.""The SEC must use its full authority to address these risks, and Congress must also step up to close these regulatory gaps,"" she added. https://t.co/VVuJAngL5j The Democratic Senator also serves as the chair for the Senate Banking Committee on Economic Policy. Warren’s brisk ultimatum was directed to the SEC chair, Gary Gensler. In the Draft Crypto Exchange letter, Warren said that cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase pose significant risks to consumers. She said: “These types of platforms lack the same types of basic regulatory protections as traditional national securities exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.” She further commented saying: “The SEC must use its full authority to address these risks, and Congress must also step up to close these regulatory gaps.” This isn’t the first time Warren has acted aggressively towards the crypto industry. Earlier this year she cautioned people to stay away from Bitcoin and said that it wouldn’t end well. Many powerful figures in the United States have expressed concern of the growing rise of cryptocurrency. Former United States Federal Reserve Chair, Jannet Yellen, recently framed cryptocurrencies as a grave danger to society. She said: “I see the promise of these new technologies, but I also see the reality: Cryptocurrencies have been used to launder the profits of online drug traffickers; they’ve been a tool to finance terrorism.” Yellen made these comments back in February after a letter was released by the United Nations which said that cryptocurrencies were being used to fund Islamic terrorists groups Al-Qaeda and ISIS. What this paragraph said in this document was astonishing. It read: “The United States announced in August 2020 the dismantling of a campaign that used cyber financing to channel funds in support of Al-Qaida. Al-Qaida affiliates in the Syrian Arab Republic operated a Bitcoin network using Telegram channels and other social media platforms to solicit cryptocurrency donations.” So, sectors of the United States federal government appear to be keeping a close eye on crypto and how it’s used for terrorism as they claim. There are quite a lot of narratives being crafted within the U.S. about cryptocurrencies and the dangers they present. The IRS will be closely monitoring crypto exchanges in the coming years for tax evasion, U.S. intelligence claims they are monitoring the use of crypto in global terrorism, and some lawmakers like Warren are saying that crypto is not safe for investors to buy. So, there’s a lot of negative press which seems foreboding. If you enjoyed this article, you might also want to check out: Russian law makers propose legislation that would seize crypto assets."
2021-07-08 12:08:06+00:00,Russian Lawmakers Prepare Crypto Legislation That Would Seize Assets,https://blockzeit.com/russian-lawmakers-prepare-crypto-legislation-that-would-seize-assets/,"Russian Lawmaker General Igor Krasnov is concerned about the use of criminal activity in cryptocurrency. Now he has revealed some new details about his plan for crypto legislation in Russia.  In a recent press conference, Krasnov said: “A serious challenge is the criminal use of cryptocurrencies in our country. A significant step in overcoming this problem was the adoption in July 2020 of the federal law. Currently, work is underway to amend the criminal and criminal procedural legislation. This will allow the application of restrictive measures and confiscation of virtual assets.” So, will this this effect normal, everyday crypto investors in Russia? Russia’s legal framework for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is very early. It was only in 2020 where a tax law was instituted for those earning profits from crypto investments. Also, Russia’s financial surveillance body, Rosfinmonitoring, was developing a classification code for what they deem suspect transactions. In June it was reported that President Biden met with Vladimir Putin toI discuss ways the United States and Russia could work together to combat ransomware. Many were expecting the two leaders to mention cryptocurrency during this meeting, however, it was not mentioned. And Putin has still not commented much on crypto and Bitcoin. But Russian Lawmaker Krasnov has. In the same conference, Krasnov specifically warned about the use of digital assets in cyber crimes. He said: “Obviously, the problem of criminal use of virtual assets, digital money, and other modern technologies, including artificial intelligence, will soon only grow. It is even more important to draw up additional effective responsible measures against these threats.” Some were questioning if the ransomware narrative would extend to Russia. Here Krasnov has adopted the narrative and extended it to other areas of technology such as artificial intelligence. So, the question remains. Will Russia and other governments be able to confiscate crypto? Industry experts weigh in. Nikita Soshnikov, director of Alfacash, spoke with Cointelegraph in regards to this issue. He said: “Obvious that digital assets kept in wallets would be impossible to confiscate like any other type of assets. However, there is already one landmark case where FSB officers were found guilty for accepting bribes, and the court formally seized 0.1 and 4.70235 BTC as state revenue.” So, governments do not have the technological authority to seize crypto assets. However, it’s possible through law they could coerce an individual to fork over their crypto assets through threats of incarceration.

Brazil’s first #Bitcoin exchange, Mercado Bitcoin, just raised $200m from SoftBank! – CoinTelegraph Because of a growing demand for cryptocurrencies in the region, Mercado Bitcoin plans to use the money to build the framework to meet this public request. This was revealed in a statement made by the company on Thursday. There are many good things to come for Mercado Bitcoin if they follow in the footsteps of 2TM Group. 2TM Group is another Latin American crypto exchange owned by the same founder as Mercado, and is currently worth $2.1 billion dollars. The company has grown tremendously in the last six months with a client base that is now over 30% larger than it was in January. The CEO of Softbank commented that Mercado Bitcoin is set to be leading the charge of the South American crypto insurgency and as the most valuable player in Brazil’s digital asset revolution. And the revolution won’t be stopping any time soon. Some experts have estimated that the Financial Technology economy in Brazil will be valued at $24 billion by 2030. Cryptocurrency is also helping to spread financial services through the Brazil population that traditional finance has yet to facilitate. And it’s not just Brazil which has seen heavy growth in the crypto Industry. Mexico and Argentina have all seen widespread adoption of crypto due to economic demands lead by their populations. And after El Salvador made Bitcoin their national currency, there have been words spoken that indicate other South American countries to follow suit. This has yet to be determined, however. Robert Dagnoni, the CEO of 2TM Group is very enthusiastic about the future of cryptocurrencies. He recently said in a interview: “Cryptocurrencies were no exception to that trend. In Brazil, and generally speaking in Latin America, millions of people are realizing that digital assets and cryptocurrencies are both innovative emerging technologies and are efficient in storing value.” He also commented that crypto is receiving attention because of the low interest rates in Brazil. He said: “We’ve seen some of the lowest interest rates on record in Brazil, which fuled the development of the alternative assets industry. Crypto is benefiting from this trend, which can also be seen in other asset classes, such as VCs and Private Equity.” Cryptocurrencies have seen incredible rates of adoption in Brazil. If Dagnoni is correct, then the growth of this industry in Latin America has only begun. With the rapid growth of crypto in Latin America and many other parts of the world, the crypto community has been shown that there is a blockchain uprising taking place on an international level.

Now, the president of Kazakhstan introduced a surcharge for electricity used by crypto miners — the so-called Tax Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan.  At the moment, there are approximately twenty mining facilities in Kazakhstan. Crypto mining is already a highly expensive procedure with lot’s of overhead costs. Therefore, if taxes become too high in Kazakhstan, it might cause miners to find the place less congenial to their needs than they thought originally. The new laws will be enacted at the beginning of next year. At the moment, there are approximately twenty mining facilities in Kazakhstan. After China banned all crypto mining back, many miners flocked to Kazakhstan which was already a popular place for farms. One of the largest Bitcoin mining companies in China, Bit Mining, has already delivered hundreds of machines to Kazakhstan. Right now, Kazakhstan ranks in 4th place as one of the world’s crypto mining centers with a hash rate of over 6%. The country is known for it’s highly affordable electricity costs. In fact, it is the cheapest place to mine Bitcoin in the world. The President of Kazakhstan also takes very seriously the practice of renewable energy. At the end of may, he held a conference working with lawmakers to install a viable plan for renewable energy. The President said that he expects the renewable energy filed to grow enormously. The government has also developed a plan for incentives to provide businesses who use sustainable energy. The Prime Minister of Kazakhstan, Alikhana Smailova, last month released a document which revealed the government has considered at great lengths the crypto industry and has already developed proposals for how to regulate the industry. And some government officials in Kazakhstan have proposed that the government itself should control crypto exchanges. Also, in the document last month, it was revealed that exchanges will be required to meet certain standards in order to conduct business transactions. Additionally, the Bank of Kazakhstan has already begun experimenting with a bank backed digital currency. Government officials in Kazakhstan are not oblivious to the cash cow that the crypto industry is. While they might appear friendly to miners and crypto busineses at the moment, it seems like their intentions come from opportunistic intentions.

And he’s bringing on a special guest. Elon Musk. The event will feature an array of crypto entrepreneurs and even the former deputy director of the CIA strangley enough. But more importantly, Elon Musk and Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey, have agreed via a tweet to jointly speak at a gathering at an event for Bitcoin investors – The ₿ Word. In the tweet, Dorsey invited Musk to come speak at the event. However, it has not officially been confirmed that Musk will appear, although he agreed in the tweet. Dorsey made a sexual implication as a joke saying – “Let’s have the talk.” He’s referring to the talk parents have with their adolescent children. And Musk replied: “For the Bitcurious? Very well. Let’s Do it.” Elon Musk and Jack are likely to be a fun pair to have together on stage. But Jack Dorsey isn’t all fun and games. He really appears to be serious about Bitcoin and its future, according to his recent activities. Recently, he said: “As companies and institutions like us are getting into Bitcoin, we all need to better understand how to put the community first and how we may help it thrive, even when it appears to be against our own interests. Doing so will benefit all over the long-term.” Jack according to his remarks is more concerned about how Bitcoin can help solve problems such as the global poverty crisis than he is about what’s best for the privileged few. Musk has mostly been absent from the world of crypto. Though he does make his occassional jokes. How many Bitcoin maxis does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Musk got a variety of tweets in response to his joke including YouTuber Lark Davis, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, Global Macro Investor CEO Raoul Pal, Jordan Belfort, Peter McCormack, and Myspace founder Tom – the Tweet went viral. Musk seems to still have a light hearted view of cryptocurrency and is still publishing tweets about Doge and meme coins like Shiba Inu. So, it’s uncertain where this event with Jack Dorsey will lead to and if Musk seriously is going to attend. Musk also has chosen not to be involved with Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin mining council as he initially expressed interest in. In general, Musk is continuing to show the same lackadaisical point of view towards Bitcoin he has had for most of the year. He hasn’t displayed the same serious interest which entrepreneurs like Michael Saylor and Jack Dorsey have. But maybe this event could turn the tide for Musk’s feelings about Bitcoin."
2021-06-29 09:44:57+00:00,Crypto in India More Popular Than Ever Before,https://blockzeit.com/crypto-in-india-more-popular-than-ever-before/,"Crypto in India is booming. While there’s a lot of doubt in the cryptosphere these days about the market’s future, there is always a ray of light somewhere. And in this case, that is the fact that Indian investments in cryptocurrency have risen to nearly 20,000% in a single year according to new findings from Coingecko. Since last year, the top four crypto exchanges in India have had an increase of daily trading. From $10 million all the way up to new findings of $100 million. India has now become one of the world’s top crypto markets in the world. This is a strong reversal from India’s love of gold. Though it appears that the country has hopped onto the digital assets train even if the Indian government has threatened to ban it. A native young entrepreneur, Richi Sood, said that she is more interested in crypto than physical assets at the moment. She said: “I’d rather put my money in crypto than gold. Crypto is more transparent than gold or property and returns are more in a short period of time.” It turns out that Sood is quite a savvy trader however. She sold a part of her positions earlier in February when Bitcoin broke new grounds in the $50,000 price range. After the big crash in May, Sood bought back her position with the profits she made. Earlier in this month it was documented that the Indian government is currently reviewing a proposed legalization that would see crypto banned in India. However, it was revealed by an anonymous source that the government is also seriously considering a form of legalization that would not ban cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. However, not everyone is dismayed by the news. Sood in particular commented in regards to this: “I have a risk-taking appetite, so I’m willing to take a risk of a ban.” It appears the big shift comes from the younger generations who is willing to take on higher risk investments like cryptocurrencies. The founder of an Indian crypto exchange told Bloomberg: “They find it far easier to invest in crypto than gold because the process is very simple. You go online, you can buy crypto, you don’t have to verify it, unlike gold.” On that point, pioneers in the crypto field have done an excellent job in providing liquidity for the crypto market through the novel inventions of liquidity pools and automated market makers. If anything, this story shows that even in countries that threaten to ban crypto l like India, crypto can continue to not only exist, but thrive.

It was on this just last week that the SEC was set to review an application from Valkyrie Bitcoin.  The price of bitcoin regained some ground this morning, but trading of bitcoin ETFs is still to be determined as the SEC postponed its decisions on allowing trading of such ETFs again https://t.co/PI8dVhxkqn The U.S. stock market is one of the largest in the world. As many have pointed out, an Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund) in the U.S. would cause FOMO (fear of missing out) to kick in hard for Bitcoin. This comes to no surprise, however, as officials from the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission have expressed their skepticism about Bitcoin before. According to a public statement made last month from the organization’s website, staff called Bitcoin a “highly speculative asset.” A statement from the letter reads: “As such, investors should consider the volatility of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin futures market, as well as the lack of regulation and potential for fraud or manipulation in the underlying Bitcoin market.” A Coindesk staff member said in light of the SEC’s attitude towards crypto: “I have some thoughts about the role of the SEC. They move from an institution that makes sure people have the right information to an institution that’s excluding products they don’t like.” This is not the first application the SEC received. There are 10 other crypto ETF applications that for the SEC that are waiting to be evaluated. In fact, the verdict of another Bitcoin ETF application was also delayed last week. Soon, the SEC will have a lot of catching up to do. There is always the possibility of the SEC reversing their attitude towards crypto. As they said that they welcome information about ETFs. The fact of the matter is that the resolve to get a Bitcoin ETF approved has been growing. Another reporter from Coindesk said in a recent vide on this subject: “I think the fact that there is a dash of cold water on this is an interesting signaling move by this agency. The SEC has been calling Bitcoin speculative for years.” Even though the SEC does not seem to be changing their opinions on Bitcoin and crypto, the rising popularity in Bitcoin could give rise to a different outcome from the SEC soon. There will likely be more companies applying for this in the future. Some have even hinted at an Ethereum ETF. Thus, it looks like it will be a while until the SEC accepts a crypto ETF application.

2021-06-25 13:50:36+00:00,Billion Dollar Bitcoin Scam In South Africa,https://blockzeit.com/billion-dollar-bitcoin-scam-in-south-africa/,"Two South African brothers have vanished, along with 3.6 billion dollars in Bitcoin, from their cryptocurrency investment platform. This isn’t the first Bitcoin scam in South Africa though. The two brothers, Ameer and Raees Cajee, are the founders of a cryptocurrency investment platform called Africrypt. This week, reports say that the two brothers are now missing. Not only that – they disappeared a long with 3.6 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin. This raises enormous suspicions and many have already accused Ameer and Raees of scamming their clients and stealing the multi billion dollar worth of assets. There were several issues happening with the Africrypt platform. Africrypt investors received an e-mail informing them that a hack breached the safety of wallets, nodes, and accounts. The e-mail briefed shareholders that there would be a freeze of all of Africrypt’s accounts due to the hack. The strange things was: the two brothers requested Africrypt investors not to report the incident to the police. Of course as one might imagine, investors of Africrypt were not comfortable about the situation. Several investors went to attorneys to liquidate their Africrypt investments. It was then when they discovered that billions of dollars in Bitcoin, the entrie company’s networth, was transferred from the digital wallet where it belonged to a new chain address. According to an attorney from Cape Town, the funds were for all practicality untraceable. Now Hanekom, a Cape Town law firm, is working with the national police to locate the missing brothers. This isn’t the first Bitcoin scam in South Africa though. Last year, Johann Steynberg, the CEO of Mirror Trading International (MTI), reportedly fled to Brazil when his company was in provisional liquidation last month, as investors were attempting to extract their capital. It was discovered that his company kept no accounting records, following an investigation by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA). Brandon Topham, a high ranking FSCA official told Bloomberg: “At the point something becomes a Ponzi scheme, we have lost our jurisdiction,” he said. “We need the police and the prosecuting authority to work fast and put people in jail.” The MTI scandal happened all the way back in January. And at that point, South African authorities were professing the need for regulation to the public and lawmakers. Now with another alleged Ponzi scheme with the Africrypt brothers, arguments posing for regulation in South Africa are likely going to resurface and strengthen. This is a disheartening piece of news and brings in another wave of negative press for Bitcoin and crypto in general. There have been no further reports on the wherabouts of the Cajee brothers. It appears the only way for shareholders of Africrypt to have their stolen money returned to them is if police successfully take Ameer and Raess into custody. One can hope for the best that the stolen money is returned."
2021-06-25 09:37:49+00:00,Wyckoff Accumulation: Is The Wyckoff Valid for Bitcoin?,https://blockzeit.com/wyckoff-accumulation-is-the-wyckoff-valid-for-bitcoin/,"Several crypto experts believe that the phase that Bitcoin price is going through right now is a so-called “Wyckoff Accumulation”.But what exactly is a Wyckoff Accumulation and is it valid? The Wyckoff accumulation is a century old form of technical analysis created by Richard D. Wyckoff. It is based on the principles of supply and demand. According to Wykoff there are two main phases in a market cycle: The accumulation phase and the distribution phase. If this was our Wyckoff spring moment then July could be very exciting! #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/v4HnbrOARp The accumulation phase usually follows a big price drop (Phase A) In the accumulation phase the price bottoms out as investors are starting to accumulate share or in this case Bitcoin. The demand and supply are close to even until slowly investors feel more comfortable to buy more and the price rises (Phase D and E in Graph). The distribution phase can be imagined as the mirrored version of this graph. After a heavy price increase, demand and supply are even and the price stops increasing, over time leading to a larger crash in price. Wyckoffs method states markets never repeat exact circumstances. So, instead of looking for the market to repeat itself, Wyckoff’s method requires analysts to look at broader sets of patterns. All price patterns vary slightly from previous incarnations either by size or volume to therefore making analysts adopt to different sets of outcomes instead of the same one. The second rule to the Wyckoff method tells investors and analysts to respect market relativity. Meaning, in order to understand today’s market trend, one must also evaluate the past. Finally, In the Wyckoff method, Wyckoff introduced three trends. These include up, down, and flat. He also introduced three time frames in his strategy: short term, intermediate, and long term. According to many experts in the industry, we could soon entering an uptrend in Bitcoin price. If this was our Wyckoff spring moment then July could be very exciting! #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/v4HnbrOARp The the chart above which Lark Davis tweeted, one can see that some are theorizing we have ended the bottom trend of Wyckoff Accumulation. And some say that just this week, the low of around 28k which Bitcoin sank to tested support to spring right back up to 33k. In comment to this, market analysis Kevin Swanson said: “In terms of the Wyckoff method, this $28.8K lower low is very similar to the $65K higher high. Both cause a maximum emotional effect on market participants.” Time will soon tell if the Bitcoin bounce off of 28k support this week is the spring to send Bitcoin back to reach it’s previous all time high. Many in crypto are hoping for a bullish reversal of the market come July. If you enjoyed this article, make sure to also check out: Mark Cuban Loses Big Time On Iron Finance: Calls For Regulation."

According to a Spanish newspaper, McAfee was being extradited to the U.S. for tax evasion via a recent court ruling.  McAfee was the founder of the security software company of the same name. McAfee had a contraversial public image. According to an article from the Independent back in March, McAfee was charged for fraud in federal court. Andy Strauss, a Manhattan U.S. district attorney said: “McAfee and Watson (McAfee’s associate) exploited a widely used social media platform and enthusiasm among investors in the emerging cryptocurrency market to make millions through lies and deception.” Prosecutors accused McAfee of raising publicity for cryptocurrencies he owned like Dogecoin and selling them for profit from what they call manipulating the market. However, the U.S. government has long been trying to extradite McAfee for tax evasion and failure of reporting income. McAfee has made a lot of hype in the crypto space since 2017 when he said Bitcoin’s price would be 500,000 by 2020. McAfee also made headlines in 2012 after fleeing Belize after his neighbor was found dead. However, police eventually declared McAfee was not a suspect. “The US believes I have hidden crypto. I wish I did but it has dissolved through the many hands of Team McAfee (your belief is not required), and my remaining assets are all seized. My friends evaporated through fear of association.” McAfee however firmly believed crypto had the power to free people from the power structure of the global financial system. Three years ago I predicted a war between governments and crypto. The FED now calls crypto a threat to economic stability and China is outlawing it. The war is on and I am a major target. Do not be afraid. Crypto is our last hope for financial independence. https://t.co/0nDLU4zCEP Some speculate that authorities came down hard after McAfee because of his brazen call outs to the banks and the IRS. McAfee claimed he had not filed a tax return since 2010. And he even wrote a letter to the IRS back then informing them of his decisions to not pay anymore federal taxes. It would make sense for them to make an example of a figure like McAfee and say “This is what happens when you don’t pay taxes”. "
2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2021-06-24 07:07:00+00:00,MicroStrategy Stock Drops With Bitcoin Price,https://blockzeit.com/microstrategy-stock-drops-with-bitcoin-price/,"The MicroStrategy stock drops with Bitcoin on Tuesday, 22 June. The company, lead by CEO Michael Saylor just purchased nearly a half a billion dollars in Bitcoin on Monday. However, since MicroStrategy’s portfolio is so heavy in Bitcoin, MicroStrategy’s stock price dropped 16% in light of the recent Bitcoin dip.  The MicroStrategy price fell heavily this week and is currently down more than 100% from its all-time high of above $1,300 from last month when Bitcoin has reached its peak during that stage of the bull run. MSTR stock is a unique case this week, at a time where the NASDAQ just reached another all-time high. It is clear that the MicroStrategy stock is now fully depending on the Bitcoin price movements. Michael Saylor has not commented on the current price of MSTR. Some find it amusing how exposed Saylor is to Bitcoin as for example Dougalas Boneparth mentions in his tweet: At this point, bitcoin should just buy MicroStrategy. Michael Saylor has significantly contributed to the crypto community since he entered the market back in October 2020. Saylor and his Bitcoin Mining Council initiative have been a ray of good news in the blockchain and crypto space while the past two months have mostly been dominated from negative press. Saylor has also been celebrating the Wall Street adoption of Bitcoin. In the last twelve months, #Bitcoin has arrived on Wall Street. That is the news. The rest is noise. https://t.co/hDdTJYXrbm It appears that nothing can shake the beliefs that Michael Saylor has in Bitcoin. When the news ton Bitcoin turned bearish, Saylor doubled down. When everyone was selling, his company MicroStrategy took on more dept to increase its position by 20% to a total. of 105,000 Bitcoins. Bitcoin’s market cap is now nearly half of what it was in it’s peak in April. Currently the general sentiment of the crypto market is very bearish. Still, Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy are not at all concerned about the dip. Michael Saylor is a huge Bitcoin supporter and keeps. on doubling down, however, one has to ask: Is it possible that he is so far in, that he cannot go back? Clear is that he is taking a huge risk with MicroStrategy. Only time will tell whether it will pay off. Until then we will likely see the MicroStrategy price follow the movements of Bitcoin.

2021-06-23 13:37:16+00:00,Bitcoin Mining In Iran: Iranian Police Crack Down Heavy,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-mining-in-iran-iranian-police-crack-down-heavy/,"There has been a strong opposition to Bitcoin mining in Iran since the government banned mining temporarily last month. Now the Iranian Police reported that they will start taking these new laws seriously. According to Islamic Public News Agency, the police chief of Tehran said: “With the efforts of the Tehran Prevention Police, in cooperation with the Tehran Electricity Organization, Iran’s largest currency cryptocurrency farm was discovered in an abandoned factory in the west of Tehran.” In a further comment to the large mine which the police found just recently, the Islamic Public News Agency said: “The capital’s senior police official noted that 7,000 miners were discovered in the operation, which according to electrical experts, about 4 percent of the country’s electricity is needed for the operation of these miners, noting that some of these miners have been installed and others are under construction” Police chief Hossein Rahimi described that Tehran police acquired 7,000 miners across fifty different locations. The Iranian Police has been actively in pursuit of illicit mining since May when Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced, that Iran would put a temporary ban on the practice of Bitcoin farming. But it’s not just the giant mines which Iranian officials are cracking down on. Back in May, the TehranTimes reported that small household miners can also face hefty fines saying: “Iranian Energy Ministry’s spokesman for the electricity sector said that those cryptocurrency miners, who use household electricity, will have to pay a heavy fine if identified.” However, it’s not all doom and gloom for crypto miners in Iran. The President of Iran has announced that he would like to see regulation of cryptocurrency and blockchain. Additionally, the same TehranTimes article reported that the head of Iran’s Thermal PowerPlant Holding Company would seek safer alternatives to source energy for crypto mining saying: “Iran’s Thermal Power Plant Holding Company (TPPH) announced that his company is going to hold a tender for offering the electricity output of three power plants for cryptocurrency mining.” Iran was suffering from heavy blackouts that could have been caused by heavy crypto mining. While Iranian Police are focusing heavily on combatting local Bitcoin mining, there is still hope that the country will legalize Bitcoin mining again when better solutions to mining are available.

2021-06-22 19:31:33+00:00,People’s Bank Of China Bans Bitcoin Transactions,https://blockzeit.com/peoples-bank-of-china-bans-bitcoin-transaction/,"Central banks in China are ordering Chinese domestic banks not to participate in any way with cryptocurrency. In a statement released today, the People’s Bank of China has requested that all banks ban transactions with cryptocurrencies. Will China soon ban Bitcoin for good? The letter published on the bank’s website states: “Our bank is determined not to carry out or participate in any business activities related to virtual currency, prohibits the access of customers involving virtual currency transactions, and will increase the investigation and monitoring of customers and capital transactions. Once relevant actions are discovered, measures such as suspension of account transactions and termination of customer relationships will be taken immediately, and relevant authorities will be reported in a timely manner.” This is a highly aggressive stance that the People’s Bank of China is taking towards Bitcoin. China is one of the biggest hubs for cryptocurrency. Their continued crackdown within the past couple of months has affected the market in a detrimental way. The Bitcoin price is in a vulnerable sideways trading pattern and this news created a lot of selling pressure. The People’s Bank of China blames cryptocurrency for being a method of payment to fund criminal activities as well as damaging regular financial order. At a certain point one will wonder how long the China FUD can continue to impact the market. Eventually, one would think that it would become less potent as time goes by. However, if the People’s Bank of China does not lift this ban, it can make it difficult for people to sell their crypto assets. Chinese investors would have to become creative on how to liquidate their Bitcoin and other crypto assets. It does not come at a surprise that the Chinese government is cracking down on cryptocurrencies as the decentralized nature of crypto is a risk to their way of governing. Decentralization does not give the government of China control. It is actually astonishing, that the Chinese government hasn’t reacted harsher towards cryptocurrencies earlier. In the past the Chinese government has banned technologies and western technology companies such as Google and Facebook. It is very likely that they will do the same with cryptocurrencies. As written above, the People’s Bank of China believes that crypto is a threat to the normal established financial order. However, the people’s bank of China couldn’t be more transparent about their bias. They frame the regular financial order as a pillar of sorts which protects against illicit financial activity. And then they frame crypto as a hub for criminals to get away with their business malpractices. However, it appears that the pressure comes from the Chinese government directly. A government that perhaps fears to lose control in a world of decentralized finance.

2021-06-22 15:02:13+00:00,Bitcoin Fails To Break Resistance And Passes Death Cross,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-fails-to-break-resistance-and-passes-death-cross/,"The last few days were very important for the Bitcoin price. It had the chance to break resistance or face a technical pattern called the death cross. Unfortunately for the Bitcoin, the price broke through the support and caused this death cross pattern. Here is what this means. For those investors who are wondering when Bitcoin will crack resistance YouTuber and Crypto expert Lark Davis has to say: “We’re not anywhere close.” Just yesterday Bitcoin failed to break resistance levels and instead broke support under what’s known as a death cross. A death cross is a trading pattern which indicates a long bearish period if support is broken. However, not in all cases does support being broken under a death cross mean a full bearish period. But many say this will signal price movement of Bitcoin to the lower 20,000s. However, Lark said he believes that no one should expect the Bitcoin price to move for several months. He said: “Then again, it could not take several months. We could see some very bullish news in the next few days that could send the market raging. You know how susceptible this market is to good news driven narratives like Facebook buying $1 billion worth of Bitcoin, for example. But if that doesn’t happen, I think we’re going to see Bitcoin ranging in the $30,000 – $4,000 for quite some time.” A death cross occurs when the 50 day moving average falls below the 200 day moving average. It is considered a bearish signal. Many have analyzed that the current death cross pattern and believe it is very similar to a similar death cross from 2018 which caused the end of the current bull run according to experts. This sent the price of Bitcoin on a downwards price pattern for the remainder of 2018. However, Lark does not agree the assessment that this death cross signals a repeat of the 2018 crash. He says: “The current market structure doesn’t currently look anything like this at all. This is a rather different situation in terms of the structure of the market. We can see there are a lot more up and down movements and just a tapering off like a ball coming down and bouncing less and less… Until it eventually just stops moving.” However, what Lark believes is going on right now is called a Wyckoff accumulation where big wallets are slowly building their position. Lark says this current market trend is very typical to the Wyckoff accumulation pattern. Lark predicts that Bitcoin will be ranging potentially into the high 20,000s into the next several weeks where he predicts there will be a big bounce. However, Lark says that if Bitcoin fails to hold levels in the high 20,000s and breaks lower support levels, the bears will be the winners. And there could be a repeat of the 2018 crash. Lark says that the whales and institutions are playing the long game for Bitcoin right now. They can wait several years to see a return in their investment and they are happy to be patient to see those gains. Meanwhile, retails investors are panicking about a possible extended bear market. Regardless though of the short term market conditions, whales and institutions clearly believe in the future of Bitcoin according to Lark. This article is not financial advice.

2021-06-22 14:19:36+00:00,Michael Saylor Expands MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Position Once Again,https://blockzeit.com/michael-saylor-expands-microstrategys-bitcoin-position-once-again/,"It appears that nothing can shake the belief that Michael Saylor has in Bitcoin. In the past weeks and months he has been increasing his Bitcoin position, doing anything in his power to buy more of this crypto asset. And he just announced on Twitter, that he purchased an additional $489 million in Bitcoin and now holds 105,085 Bitcoins. MicroStrategy has purchased an additional 13,005 bitcoins for ~$489 million in cash at an average price of ~$37,617 per bitcoin. As of 6/21/21 we #hodl ~105,085 bitcoins acquired for ~$2.741 billion at an average price of ~$26,080 per bitcoin. $MSTRhttps://t.co/gLfnOxZEZc MicroStrategy already owns more Bitcoin than any other publicly listed company. This is wild to imagine considering that Michael Saylor’s company, MicroStrategy, has a market cap that is one-hundred times less than Tesla’s sitting at 5.8 billion. Yet MicroStrategy owns more than twice the Bitcoin that Tesla does. Over exposure to Bitcoin has caused the value of MicroStrategy stock to be over 60% less than where it was sitting in Febuary. However, Saylor does not seem to care one bit. Saylor appears to genuinely believe that Bitcoin is his ace in the hole. If one looks at the amount of debt the company is in versus their equity value, one might think Michael Saylor is absolutely nuts. An article from Cointelegraph.com says: “Its latest quarterly report also shows a weaker balance sheet as of March 31, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 4.55 — a significant debt load of $1.66 billion against an equity valuation of $0.37 billion.” But perhaps Saylor is on to something that no other entrepreneur with his net worth is. Saylor acknowledge’s Bitcoin’s volatility, however, this seems to be of minor turbulence to him. Saylor has stated numerous times that he is a long term holder of Bitcoin. If you read an article we published last week about the Bitcoin mining council, then you’ll know that Saylor recently said he believes Bitcoin will reach a 100 trillion dollar market cap. This is roughly a 100x in value from here. However, there is some troubling news among this story. Juan De La Hoz, an exchange-traded fund strategist warns that if MicroStrategy becomes bankrupt, they will likely liquidate their Bitcoin portfolio. Hoz believes that this could happen if the current Bitcoin price of ranging in the mid 30,000s falls around another 50%. If MicroStrategy liquidates such a large portfolio at a significant crash such as this, it could really send the entire crypto industry into a bear market that could last several years. However, Michael Saylor is a smart investor. He likely wouldn’t be purchasing half a billion in Bitcoin if he didn’t believe that this is the Bottom of the dip. So, this could be a sign that the bottom is in. However, there is no guarantee and even someone with as much to lose as Saylor does could be wrong. Like all traders, Michael Saylor is making a gamble whenever he buys Bitcoin. Because no one will ever know when the bottom is."
2021-06-19 20:05:06+00:00,Michael Saylor Hosts Discussion On Bitcoin Mining Council,https://blockzeit.com/michael-saylor-hosts-discussion-on-bitcoin-mining-council/,"Recently, billionaire Michael Saylor lead a Twitter Spaces discussion in which he opened up about some details regarding the Bitcoin mining council. And there were some juicy details in the Twitter Spaces chat which Saylor hosted that should wet the appetite of any Bitcoin holder.  According to an article from Coindesk.com: “NLW argues that what’s clear from the session is that Saylor is focused on scaling Bitcoin from a $1 trillion asset to a $100 trillion network and fighting anything that stands in the way.” Michael Saylor differs from Elon Musk in many ways. He is much more serious about cryptocurrency, and he has the intention of sending Bitcoin to the moon either for his own profit or for bringing humanity a better alternative than the traditional financial system. While many saw Elon Musk as an appointed leader in crypto back in late January, after he changed his Twitter profile logo to a Bitcoin logo and tweeted: “It was invitable.” Many fans of Musk and crypto cheered on Elon’s involvement in Bitcoin. But it turned out to be a turbulent ride for the following months. Over time Elon’s crypto related tweets became more strange while he made many Tweets about Dogecoin and not Bitcoin. Then in May, Musk disappointed the entire Bitcoin and crypto community. Elon Musk said Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin as payments due to unclean energy used in Bitcoin mining. It was then Michael Saylor who came to the rescue and started the Bitcoin mining council. While Saylor attempted to bring Elon onto the council, Elon failed to participate to a significant degree. Still, Saylor is leading the charge in hopes that soon Bitcoin mining can be done completely on clean energy. The Bitcoin mining council is an effort to bring clean energy into Bitcoin mining. And Michael Saylor is leading the charge in this initiative. On Wednesday night, Saylor hosted a 90 minute Twitter spaces open to the entire Twitter community. The cool thing about Saylor’s initiative is that he has made the movement quite transparent as demonstrated while he hosted this discussion. Wall Street veteran and well known Bitcoin investor Caitlin Long asked many of the questions to Saylor during the 90 minute call. According to the report on the call from Coindesk.com. In one question, Long asked: “Are public companies who put Bitcoin on their balance sheets actually good for Bitcoin, or does it created strange incentives and new risks? Michael Saylor responded that he does not believe so. He does not doubt the future of Bitcoin one bit. As said in the quote above, Saylor believes that one day Bitcoin will be a 100 trillion dollar asset. This is a 100X from here meaning that if Saylor is right, the price of Bitcoin will one day be almost $4 million per coin. This is of course highly speculative, and no one can say this for certain. But when a billion speaks so highly about a particular asset such as Bitcoin, it means that there could be big thing in store for the future.

2021-06-18 07:31:42+00:00,President Biden Wants To Work With Russia To End Ransomware,https://blockzeit.com/president-biden-wants-to-work-with-russia-to-end-ransomware/,"In an unexpected move, the United States President, Joe Biden, teased a possible cooperation with Russia to combat ransomware attacks. The U.S. President and his administration are taking the Colonial Pipelines ransomware attacks very seriously.  According to an article from Cointelegraph.com, the Joe Biden stated: “Responsible countries need to take action against criminals who conduct ransomware activities on their territory.” It is clear that these ransomware attacks were only possible because of cryptocurrencies. The discussions on the ransomware attacks are harmful for Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market, as the decentralized nature of crypto allows criminals to easily use digital currencies. Although cryptocurrencies do make it easier for criminals and fraudsters, the US was able to recover most of the ransom paid in Bitcoin. Nevertheless, whenever people talk about ransomware attacks and connect it to Bitcoin, it does leave a bad mark on digital currencies. The Russian Central Bank has largely ignored cryptocurrency and made very few public statements on the matter. The Biden Administration has shown that they are capable of taking a hard stance against cryptocurrency due to ransomware attacks. However, relationships with Russia are not good for President Biden and for that matter any politician who is a member of his political party. The Democratic Party in America has accused Russia and Putin quite brazenly about meddling in United States elections. So, what Russia will do in regards to this matter soley depends on Putin’s stance as well as other high ranking officials in the Russian government. Point being made is that it’s unlikely that Presient Biden has a large influence over Putin. And Putin isn’t going to likely be so eager to work with President Biden, unless he has an incentive. If Putin decides he does not like cryptocurrency, it’s quite possible he would work with the United States in a joint effort to further regulate the industry. According to an article from Cointelegraph.com, President Putin spoke of “electronic deposits” when discussing the payments used in the Colonial pipeline attacks. He did not mention cryptocurrency at all. And in fact, President Biden did not either. The Biden administration’s response to the ransomware attacks of been bizarre. What agenda does Biden have and why does he now wish to speak with the Russian President? When Biden asked President Putin if Russia had to do anything with the ransomware attacks, Putin denied to have anything to do with it and instead mentioned that the attackers where from the US itself. Not too long ago, Russia was accused for interfering with the US elections, it seems clear that Biden now is suspicious that Russia in other areas as well. According to Cointelegraph.com, President Biden also said: “We’ll find out whether we’ll have a cybersecurity arrangement that begins to bring some order.” It’s a bit concerning how he uses the word “order” while it’s already been suggested in the press several times that Bitcoin and crypto played a major role in the Colonial Pipeline attacks. When he says “order”, does he mean order for cryptocurrency such as regulation? If these ransomware attacks continue to happen and the press is continuing to include crypto and Bitcoin in the scandal, the cryptocurrency industry could receive a lot of negative press in the coming months.

For many this is just the beginning of mainstream adoption of Bitcoin by developing countries. The BIG question now is which country will follow next. Jack Dorsey thinks it is going to be Nigeria.  Jack Dorsey is one of the early supporters of Bitcoin. He believes that the internet needs a “native currency” and Bitcoin is one of the best contenders for this position. Bitcoin offers a big chance for developing countries to change their status quo. Last week El Salvador took this chance as their president, Nayib Bukele, announced that El Salvador will adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender. And Dorsey believes that other developing countries should follow. On Twitter now he has left several hints that Nigeria might be the next. The people of Nigeria will lead #bitcoin 🇳🇬 https://t.co/A8Ev3tMkJS What started all of this? As we mentioned, Jack has already expressed his interest in growing cryptocurrency, Bitcoin in particular, in developing nations. But more significantly, an NFL star, Russel Okung, wrote a letter to the president of Nigeria requesting that the country find a “economic sovereignty by pursuing the Bitcoin standard. Okung said: “The hope of Nigeria lies within this generation. I am proudly a Nigerian descendant living in America and am a proponent of Bitcoin. I write to urge the Nigerian government to pursue economic independence and financial sovereignty by pursuing a national Bitcoin standard. Soon every nation will be faced with this decision, but those who seize the present moment proactively as we have just witnessed in El Salvador, will enjoy significant advantages globally for generations to come.”  Okung expressed his dislike of the central banking system and believes that Bitcoin is a viable solution to the economic inequality and hardship faced by Nigerian citizens. He believes the decentralized structure of Bitcoin is the solution. He even made headlines when he converted half of his salary into Bitcoin. If Nigeria follows in the footsteps of El Salvador, the two countries will begin setting a trend for the developing world. The only question is – is it possible that bigger nations could adopt the Bitcoin standard as well? That is still to be determined, but the more countries adopt the Bitcoin standard, the higher the pressure will be on other countries to follow or be left behind. But there does seem to be major support for Bitcoin adoption in Nigeria. This news was among many other announcements that gave Bitcoin a big boost this weekend.  "
2021-06-14 16:17:53+00:00,Bureaucrat In Netherlands Threatens To Ban Crypto,https://blockzeit.com/bureaucrat-in-netherlands-threatens-to-ban-crypto/,"Pieter Hasekamp, a high level official of the head of the bureau for the Netherlands, is advising the government to ban all cryptocurrency assets due to what he believes will be a crash that will leave many investors broke. However, some people think that crypto will not actually be banned but regulated instead. JUST IN: The Netherlands should regulate #crypto instead of banning it, says finance minister Hasekamp believes that if the Netherlands bans crypto it would effect the markets in a highly negative way. And this doesn’t bother him in the slightest. Some crypto enthusiasts suppose crypto will be the end of fiat. But Hasekamp doesn’t share the same enthusiasm for crypto as these people. His views are in line with officials in the Turkish and Chinese governments both of whom set new regulatory laws for these digital assets. If Hasekamp has his way, the Netherlands will come down harder than both China and Turkey – he said he wants it banned altogether. The current sentiment of crypto in Europe varies. As we mentioned in a previous article, some Ireland officials feel called to similar action. However, a couple of countries such as Switzerland have a more lenient approach. So, the battle for blockchain and crypto is an ongoing stuggle. Governments will likely find soon that they will have a hard time banning crypto, but this will lead to them regulating it instead. This isn’t the first time that a proposal to ban crypto has been introduced in the Netherlands. In fact, according to an article from yahoo.finance, in 2018 a bill was rebuked by the Minister of Finance Wopke Hoekstra. Hoekstra said: “It is better to supervise it. My observation now is that that is more effective than a total ban in the Netherlands.” But there are more officials in the Netherlands who agree with Hasekamp. Economist at ING, Teunis Brosens, said: “I understand where it comes from if you look at the entire crypto field. Most of the hundreds, thousands of coins are bullshit or worse. There’s just scams and pyramid schemes in there too, so I understand the concern.” In an article about this topic, an author at rtlnieuws.com wrote: “Ban goes too far. A ban only goes very far, even too far, he thinks. And it is not necessary, because there are already laws to deal with scammers and cheaters, you do not have to introduce a crypto ban.” This is a good point. If there are laws already to deal with scams, why does crypto need to be banned? Despite what some say, not all crypto currencies are scams. It appears that those seeking to ban crypto currency might have ulterior motives. We will have to pay attention to the statements Hasekamp makes in the future to see if it’s possible to know what his real motives are."
2021-06-10 13:26:17+00:00,"Kusama, Cardano and Ethereum Upgrades Could Fuel Bitcoin Price",https://blockzeit.com/kusama-cardano-and-ethereum-upgrades-could-fuel-bitcoin-price/,"The Bitcoin price has seen a good amount of volatility in the past months. According to crypto YouTuber EllioTrades, there is nothing to worry about as there are several technology upgrades coming up later this year that could be a catalyst to Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market. Kusama, Polkadot, Cardano and Ethereum are just some to name a few. Elliotrades made a video this week to share with his community his thoughts of whether the crypto bullrun is over for the months and possibly. He began his video with a ominous question asking: “Are we returning to crypto winter? That is what everyone wants to know. It is either the best of times getting the most magnificent dip on all the coins that looked so bullish… Or is this the absolute suckers bull trap that leaves us all broke through the bear market?” Elliot reveals a tweet that shows two similar crashes in recent crypto history. One being in 2018 and the other in March 2020 when Covid hit. And when history is reviewed upon Elliot said that these are the two of the greatest buying opportunities anyone has had in crypto. He also mentioned that institutional investors are itching to buy the current dip. Even though whales and institutional investors can manipulate the market, they’re not in total control. And they are definitely eager to buy what many agree is a cheap price for Bitcoin compared to where it will go at the end of the year. Elliot brought up the fact that Kusama parachains are coming just around the corner as Gavin Wood just tweeted. Proposition #110 is now up for voting on @kusamanetwork – if passed, this will add the very first parachain into Kusama(!) pic.twitter.com/qEpAI2yyuO If you’re new to crypto it might be hard to understand how big of an event this is. But rest assured, whether people agree with this or not, it is one of the biggest events in crypto this year. Gavin Wood is the former CTO of Ethereum and one of the lead developers. He left Ethereum to start his own blockchain companies – Polkadot and Kusama. So, these aren’t just any smart contract ecosystem. It’s a new smart contract ecosystem like Ethereum created by the head developer of Ethereum. So, this is a big deal. The reason there is both Kusama and Polkado is that they are brother/sister networks. Kusama is the “canary” network meaning it will be more experimental then Polkadot. This is why Kusama parachains are coming first. While there is a lot of hype for these projects, it is unlikely that Gavin Wood and his team will fail to deliver the hype. Wood has one of the greatest track records of any developer and entrepreneur in crypto. When Kusama and Polkadot parachains happen, not only will the Polkadot ecosystem explode, but it will hopefully bring the whole crypto market back to life. Elliot believes that Bitcoin could get sent back to the low 20,000s this month. He said. “I would be hard pressed to believe we go much lower than that.” He also believes that a lot of cryptos will unfortunately get flushed out. But these are going to be all low market cap coins. Not anything like Ethereum or Bitcoin will suffer long term. Elliot acknowledges that he could be wrong though and that crypto could in fact enter a multi year bear. However, he said: “It just doesn’t feel that way to me. It hasn’t felt like that since we started the collapse. It feels very artificially collapsed. It feels like it still has several more legs of bullishness. Again, no cycle is like the last. But there are logical reasons we could be at the bottom here. Models like the stock to flow model, for example, showing that we’re in a bottoming zone.”fv And no doubt there are much more events than just Kusama parachains coming up. EIP1558, the greatest upgrade to Ethereum in years will be happening. Also, Cardano smart contracts will go live in the not so distsant future. And finally, the long awaited Ethereum upgrade will likely happen within the next year. And this is just the beginning.

2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
2021-06-10 08:33:18+00:00,Chinese Search Engines Block Top Three Crypto Exchanges,https://blockzeit.com/chinese-search-engines-block-top-crypto-exchanges/,"While the Bitcoin price saw a nice rally today, moving up 20%, the news on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are currently mixed. El Salvador has announced to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender which is bullish news for Bitcoin. However, in other parts of the world, governments are continuing to crack down on crypto. Such as in China where Chinese search engines blocked the top three crypto exchanges.  Top search engines in the country decided to block keywords for top three crypto exchanges. Breaking: On June 9th, all Chinese search engines such as Baidu and Sogou have blocked the three major exchanges: Binance Huobi and OKEx. pic.twitter.com/pmRZkIvOzn This is really troubling news. Before most of the FUD from China didn’t seem as bad as the market was reflecting. However, this is different. New users in China will have a much harder time navigating the web now. Furthermore, even experienced crypto traders will be inconvenienced if they use search engines to navigate their way to the exchanges they use. But it’s more troubling that this could deter new users to crypto. Crypto Twitter for new Chinese crypto might be an option to find exchanges for them if China didn’t block it’s citizens from using all Silicon Valley Tech utilities. However, it’s very easy to outmaneuver these obstacles by using a VPN which many in China do. Still, like everywhere in the world there are likely individuals in China who are not tech savvy. This could make it harder for older generations in the country to access these exchanges, for example. It comes at no surprise that China is taking these measures to hinder cryptocurrencies. The decentralized nature of crypto is a huge threat to the republic that likes to keep tight control over its people and the services they use. China tends to censor technology that they cannot control directly. Online platforms such as Facebook and Instagram are banned and nota accessible. Censoring the Top Crypto exchanges is the logical next step, when keeping in mind that China is working on creating their own digital currency: the digital Yuan. With the creation of the digital Yuan, it shows that China does see the necessity of digital currencies. However, unlike cryptocurrencies, the digital Yuan is centralized and controlled directly by the Chinese government. This sets an example of how tech companies in the west could also censor crypto as easily. Donald Trump was deplatformed from all social media accounts last year after the U.S. Presidential election. And if they can come up for a reason to deplatform the President of the U.S., with all of the ransomware FUD going on in the U.S., could we see a censorship event for crypto? There is no news out to suggest this is happening, but it’s a bit eerie to think about.

The vast majority of lawmakers in the Central American country’s Congress voted in favor of the Bitcoin law. The country hopes this will boost its economy. The Bitcoin price rose 5% to $34,239.17 shortly after the vote. According to the youg president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, over 70% of his country’s population does not have a bank account. They see cryptocurrency as a way to increase financial inclusion. The option to pay with Bitcoin will facilitate access to credit, savings, investments and secure transactions, he said. In the process, it is expected to create jobs and boost the economy. This decision is historic, writes Nayib Bukele on Twitter. Bukele was able to push the law through Congress with the help of his allies. According to AFP, opposition parties, which had criticized the speed of the vote, did not want to support the law. Congress passed the “Bitcoin law” with 62 votes out of a total of 84. The #BitcoinLaw has been approved by a supermajority in the Salvadoran Congress.62 out of 84 votes!History! #Btc🇸🇻 El Salvador is a low-income country and uses U.S. dollars as its official currency. Many families rely on money from family members living abroad. The Bitcoin law approved today intends to facilitate these remittances as well. That’s because until now, a large portion of remittances were lost to intermediaries, Bukele recently explained. The law is expected to be implemented within the next 90 days. The introduction of the digital currency will be handled via the mobile payment app Strike, which was recently launched in El Salvador. "
2021-06-09 08:29:26+00:00,Highlights From Bitcoin Miami Conference,https://blockzeit.com/highlights-from-bitcoin-miami-conference/,"The Bitcoin Conference in Miami is the world’s largest Bitcoin event. It took place from 04 – 05 of June at the Mana Convention Center in Miami. Last year’s event had to be canceled – this year it was one of the first major in-person business conferences since the start of the corona pandemic. The conference was sold-out and welcomed 12,000 attendees who were eager to talk about crypto, NFTs, blockchain – and all sorts of other crypto space stuff. Here are the highlights of this years Bitcoin 2021. Max Keiser has been a long term investor in Bitcoin. He claimed he bought it while it was only $1. In an interview with Ran Neuner, Keiser was belligerently bragging about how soon Bitcoin would end fiat currency. He said: Bitcoin is eating away at fiat. It’s destroying central banks, it’s destroying Jamie Dimon. Bitcoins is becoming higher and higher and the world is becoming a peaceful loving place.” He then proceeded to tear up a 10 dollar bill on camera which is a federal crime in the United States. He then said: “With all the Bitcoin I have I can buy any congressman or senator I want.” You have to hand it to Keiser though, he does have enthusiasm for Bitcoin. One of the best comedians around is Tim Dillion who has appeared on the Joe Rogan Podcast multiple times. Tim brought a lot of light hearted comedy that was excellent to pick up everyone at a time where Bitcoin’s short term price looks bearish. Tim asked many great questions also. And the Winklevoss Twins, the owners of Gemini Exchange, gave great answers. Tyler Winklevoss explained how while he was a big fan of Bitcoin, he also likes many other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and doesn’t believe that there will be “one coin to rule them all” so to speak. Kevin O’Leary, co-host of the hit TV show Shark Tank, shared his views on the future of cryptocurrencies and it appears that he couldn’t be more bullish. Ran Neuner asked O’Leary, “What percent of your mind did you invest in crypto?” And O’Leary said, “It’s 80 percent of my time. I am doing so much due diligence on so many deals, and there are so many commitments I’m making. I don’t see a bigger opportunity than this. Every single currency is going to be digital eventually. And the digitization of this is going to be a really interesting business model. I want to be a part of the companies that provide the infrastructure for that digitalization.” The interview on stage brought up the issue with Bitcoin transaction fees while on stage with Dorsey. He said that because he predicts the global use of Bitcoin will go up massively in the next decade, that the transaction fees will go up. He then asked Dorsey how people in third world countries will have access to these networks with the expensive transaction fees. And Jack said: “My belief in Bitcoin is that it’s an amazing asset. But I believe the internet needs a native currency and everyone in the world needs to be able to transact with it. The only reason Square got into Bitcoin is to that end. It’s not just to be an exchange. And that’s why we don’t deal with any other currencies or coins. Because we’re so focused on making Bitcoin the native currency of the internet.” The Bitcoin Miami 2021conference was full of exciting moments and interviews with crypto experts and big time entrepreneurs. It is clear that the industry has matured in the past months and years and it will be interesting to see where it will be in a few years.

2021-06-08 06:04:36+00:00,Former President Donald Trump Says Bitcoin Is A Scam,https://blockzeit.com/former-president-donald-trump-says-bitcoin-is-a-scam/,"Former U.S President Donald Trump took a stance on Bitcoin on Fox News earlier this week. He believes it is a scam and wants the U.S dollar to stay the currency of the world. Here is what he had to say. Former President Donald Trump went on air early this week to discuss his thoughts on the stock market and crypto. When asked by the host of the show if he had invested in Bitcoin, President Trump said: Bitcoin, its just seems like a scam. And it seems like it’s competing against the dollar. I want the dollar to be the currency of the world.” Trump hasn’t changed his position from previous comments in the past. He even told the then U.S. secretary of treasury Steve Mnuchin, “Go after Bitcoin.” Although nothing came to fruition on the matter. TRUMP: Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam. I don't like it. I want the dollar to be the currency of the world. pic.twitter.com/CXjALsJmXx Hours after Trump made his comments, the price of Bitcoin took a big fall of more than 8%. There’s no certainty that his attack on the digital currency caused the dump. Some say so, however, it’s hard to imagine any investors taking Trump as an expert to be listened to. However, the fact that he was a former president means he carries influence whether it makes sense or not. If a person in his position calls crypto and Bitcoin a scam, it brings more FUD to the already uncertain market. The problems which Trump doesn’t address are the issues with money printing. Right now the fact of the matter is, the dollar’s future isn’t looking too bright. And no one wants to be in a sinking ship. Trump is not ahead of the curve here. He’s backing the currency which more people are losing faith in everyday. Right now, only a small portion of the world population own Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, much of the U.S. population is waking up to the reality that money in their bank accounts might not be as safe as they’re told. The new administration seems to have a similar stance on cryptocurrencies. They’re not very fond of crypto or Bitcoin either. In fact, the current U.S. President, Joe Biden, is set to make words about his thoughts on crypto and it’s relationship with ransomware attacks that have effected oil pipelines and supply chains. Some say the president will require a new form of regulation for crypto to battle the malicious attackers. It appears that Trump is keeping his patriotic stance of having a strong dollar. And it is true, a big part of the U.S. economy depends on a strong dollar. However, the amounts in which dollars are being printed is not sustainable and will sooner or later weaken the fiat currency. As the dollar weakens it will be interesting to see if the U.S can hold the position of having the world currency. For now, the U.S. nothing to worry about, but in the long run it is possible that a digital currency could threaten the position of the dollar. "

The plan is to use this money to acquire more Bitcoin. Michael Saylor posted the following message on his Twitter account: MicroStrategy Announces Proposed Private Offering of $400 Million of Senior Secured Notes to acquire additional #bitcoin. $MSTRhttps://t.co/ilhUt1M73j Michael Saylor has been a Bitcoin evangelist for quite some time now and is one of the most active Bitcoin bulls out there. His company, MicroStrategy, currently owns 91,579 Bitcoins and it appears that they will add $400 Million more. It is likely that Michael Saylor wants to make use of the recent price plunge of Bitcoin to add to his current stash of Bitcoins. The price of Bitcoin fell from around $60,000 to $31,000 in the past weeks as fear and uncertainty hit the market.

2021-06-07 13:21:56+00:00,Ransomware Attacks Could Lead To Crypto Regulations,https://blockzeit.com/ransomware-attacks-could-lead-to-crypto-regulations/,"Whith ransomware attacks increasing in the past months, it brings up the subject if crypto currencies need to be regulated or even banned. Some people believe that this will lead to the next wave of FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) in the crypto market. In a podcast from Coindesk Podcast Network, the host of the show discussed how ransomware will be the next type of FUD to shake many out of their positions in the crypto market: “Ransomware is setting up to be the next big FUD. What has changed is the profile of some of the attacks and the media’s coverage of this as a distinct thing.” Crypto influencer agrees on this statement and thinks that ransomware attacks will lead to FUD, just like the “misinformation” about Bitcoins energy use created fear before that. DID WE JUST HIT PEAK ESG FUD in #bitcoin today with @elonmusk's stunt w/ @michael_saylor? Misinformation about bitcoin's energy use is mind-boggling. Having lived thru waves of different FUD (eg, @nic__carter's infamous FUD dice), my prediction=ransomware is the next FUD wave.🤔 In early May, the colonial oil pipeline shut down after hackers breached the systems. When the company found out of the breach, it shut down other key parts of their system because it wasn’t sure how extensive the breach was. Really importantly, this had an actual significant impact on people’s lives. It later came out that they company payed $4.4 million in ransom to get their systems restored. This kicked off a national conversation when people and media started paying attention to it, they began to see ransom attacks everywhere. There are a number of different other companies also suffering from these ransomware attacks, including food supply companies. The host of the Coindesk podcast said: “Some believe that ransomware could be the straw that breaks the camels back to ban crypto for good.” So, what this has to do with crypto you ask? Well, because of the nature of cryptocurrencies the ransom is often demanded in the form of crypto. Because they are decentralized, cryptocurrencies are difficult to track. Some people even think that this is reason enough to ban crypto. An op-ed from The Wall Street Journal last week was titled: Ban Cryptocurrency To Fight Ransomware. The article says: “The solutions floated after the Colonial hack—improved cybersecurity in the private sector and public-private collaboration to protect critical infrastructure—are pro forma and inadequate. There is a simpler and more effective way to stop the ransomware pandemic: Ban cryptocurrency. Ransomware can’t succeed without cryptocurrency. We can live in a world without cryptocurrency or a world without ransomware. But we can’t have both. It’s time for the adults to tell the children that the party is over.” And The Bloomberg Editorial Board wrote: “This is one area where a laissez-faire attitude towards technology and innovation cannot apply.” But the host of the show believes the idea that banning crypto as a solution to ransomware attacks is absurd. He claims: “Ransomware is an exploit of security vulnerabilities. To address it, it is those security vulnerabilities that must be addressed. Second the discussion of crypto banning is particularly absurd in this context unless for some reason you expect that shadowy cabals of Russian hackers are going to respect a United States crypto ban.” So, if ransomware attacks really are a problem, then banning cryptocurrency isn’t going to stop them. And one final important detail to this story – Lee Reiners, the author of the Wall Street Journal op-ed in fact has a center with crypto addresses on their website for donations. So, it appears he’s not telling the truth about his real views on crypto. Ransomware attacks are a problem that has to be dealt with, but they aren’t legitimate reasons to ban crypto. It is unlikely that crypto will be banned for this reason. But in the event that it were, it still wouldn’t end ransomware attacks, so it wouldn’t fix the problem.

2021-06-06 17:53:28+00:00,Coach K: “Elon Didn’t Do It!”,https://blockzeit.com/coach-k-musk-cant-move-the-market/,"Everyone wants to know whether Bitcoin will break out soon. Coach K, a reknown influencer in the crypto space, recently aired a livestream in which he states that we could first see a lot of sideways trading before the bull run continues. And: He doesn’t think that Elon Musk’s tweets move the market. Coach K is one of the top influencers in the crypto space. He gets a lot of hate and a lot of love. However, one thing that makes Coach K stand out is that he is up front. He is a really smart investor who has minted crypto millionaires through his work and educational content. And, he expects that we could see a lot of sideways trading for Bitcoin before we continue the bull run. Coack K stated on his livestream that just aired: “Bitcoin hit four resistance levels and failed. When you see resistance daily, there’s a good chance it’s going to get rejected before it goes back up. But if it doesn’t break resistance then it goes back down.” Coach K said it’s good to be cautious about taking advice from influencers. “Ask about who’s teaching you – how much risk management have they found success at?” “This is very interesting – I’ve never seen this before – the hash ribbons posted capitulation – and generally when this happens it lasts a while and then we break out of capitulation and get a buy signal. It means we’re not ready to break out – but we’re building up. Miners are not selling.” Coach K does not believe though that Bitcoin will crash another 50% like some people are forecasting. “We’re not going to 20k right now. It could happen, I just don’t know if it’s going to happen. But the likelihood of this happening now is very low. Many people in the market are saying Elon Musk caused the recent dip through a tweet he published on June 05. #Bitcoin 💔 pic.twitter.com/lNnEfMdtJf However, Coach K is adamant that the failure to break these resistance levels that everyone was hoping for has nothing to do with Musk: “Elon Musk does not move the market – get it through your head.” Others claim Elon Musk’s tweets were a result of billboards that have been posted in Miami for the annual Bitcoin conference. These billboards are all over Miami’s Bitcoin Conference and @elonmusk's @SpaceX facility. 🤣Love it @RussellOkung! 👇 pic.twitter.com/NsnBPciIyO We can’t verify if this is true, but regardless it seems that Elon Musk is having a fun time hacking away at Bitcoin while still publishing tweets about Dogecoin Coach K is not either bearish or bullish at the moment. He expects a lot of sideways trading in the coming weeks, and said he wouldn’t be surprised if it ends up being a very quiet summer for crypto. Coach K believes that one of the reasons for this is that we lack the trading volume. We need to be back to a full bull market. He commented: “Volume needs to be there before we get bullish.” However, he expects volume to return soon which should give Bitcoin the boost it needs to break resistance.

2021-06-04 13:30:08+00:00,Can Bitcoin And Crypto Be Banned?,https://blockzeit.com/can-bitcoin-and-crypto-be-banned/,"People are wondering how governments will regulate the crypto space. Crypto taxes, licenses and laws are being discussed in many countries. But can Bitcoin be banned? Crypto YouTuber Andrei Jikh talked about this subject on Russel Brand’s show. Andrei Jikh believes that when fiat crashes, Bitcoin will take over: Jikh isn’t concerned about countries banning Bitcoin or crypto. In fact, he said: “What countries are actually doing when they ban things is they’re running an ad marketing campaign for the currency. Because when one country bans crypto, there are dozens of other countries in the world that will happily accept this form of payment.” One of Russel’s main questions is whether Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a viable alternative to the traditional finance system. “When the new financial system is going to be rebuilt if we ever get this collapse, Bitcoin will not need permission from governments to replace it. It just will.” However, not everyone believes that backing a currency which goes against a government is good. Popular Youtuber Techlead said: “When you bet against the government, that’s an unnatural move. And you better be sure of it when you do.” The reason why it is difficult to ban Bitcoin is because of the nature of Bitcoin itself. Being decentralized, it would not be too harmful for Bitcoin to be a banned by one country. It would have to be banned by an alliance of countries. Even then it is likely that Bitcoin would be traded underground. The other question is, how would they ban it? The easiest way to ban it is to tax it so ridiculously high, that it doesn’t make sense to trade it. We are curious to see how governments will handle this in the future when cryptocurrencies might be more of a threat. However, no one knows if crypto and Bitcoin actually can replace fiat. It’s all still very early and speculative. Furthermore, it’s good to cautiously view any press which warns against a possible crypto or Bitcoin ban. This is because news has been used a lot for pure manipulation. So, just because officials from the Chinese government, for example, warn against Bitcoin being banned doesn’t mean there is actually an initiative to do so. One other issue is not Bitcoin being banned but being manipulated. If powerful and wealthy groups of people decided they wanted to crash Bitcoin, this would be more of a threat than a nation threatening to ban it. And often news is deployed so institutions, retailers, and whales can buy up large amounts of Bitcoin. It will be difficult for countries to outright ban cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, it appears that banks and hedge funds and corporations are more and more involved with cryptocurrencies. Why would they get more involved with crypto if it will soon be made illegal? It doesn’t make sense. Possibly financial institutions see Bitcoin has something to be conquered instead of demolished. They might be thinking if they can’t get rid of Bitcoin, they might as well be trying to take it for themselves. And that’s what we’ve seen a lot of in the last month – small hands selling and large wallets buying. If you enjoyed this article, please check out Is Bitcoin Over? This Is What The Experts Say."
2021-06-03 09:41:14+00:00,Is Bitcoin Over? This Is What The Experts Say,https://blockzeit.com/is-bitcoin-over-this-is-what-the-experts-say/,"What will the month of June bring for Bitcoin? After the most bearish month we’ve seen in cryptoland at least since March of 2020, many people have differing opinions about what the near term future holds. There is no doubt though that many experts agree this is an important week for Bitcoin to break out of it’s consolidation zone.  Crypto_Ed_NL believes that there could be upwards movement in the coming days as volume is going up. #BTC bearish pennant updaterejected at the red box as expected but now it needs to show strength and make that 5th leg. Expecting that bounce any moment now. When it does, I think we break out to the upside in coming days. When no bounce in coming hours: 👎 pic.twitter.com/bPi0943ynQ But this isn’t without risks. If Bitcoin fails to break resistance, we are also in trouble for a lower price range. Cointelegraph.com has even coined Wednesday as D-day for Bitoin. Meaning, a lot is on the line here. Youtuber Lark Davis also believes that we could see some unexpected moves upwards in the coming days. #bitcoin forming up a tasty little triangle on the daily. Expect volatility by week's end. pic.twitter.com/Pw1rtDztbm Lark Davis only says we should expect to see volatility. So, no one knows where we’re headed for sure. Additionally, JP Morgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou has come out with a bearish prediction for Bitcoin for the coming month ahead. He notes that he believes institutional investors are reluctant to buy right now because of Bitcoin’s bearish movement. But this contradicts a lot about the traditional crypto narrative. First of all, institutions are long term HODLers. Meaning, they don’t care if they have to wait 5 years to sell their Bitcoin for profit. And at this range Bitcoin is a better buy than it’s been in months. Panigirtzoglou also said that he predicts Bitcoin will still reach levels close to $150,000 by the end of the bull run. So, his projection of institutions being fearful to buy now doesn’t make much sense. If institutions are bullish about Bitcoin in the coming year or two, they would be loading up as Bitcoin could very possibly 5x in this year alone. So, one has to ask: how much lower can we possibly go? According to an article from cointelegraph.com, May was one of the most bearish months for Bitcoin. A quote from the article reads: “2018 was an outlier with 19% losses, but even these pale in comparison to this year. May 2021 is currently on track to be the worst month since 2013 in terms of both Q1 and Q2 performance.” So, how much more bearish can things be? Of course, there can always be another dip and recession. But it is also likely that the fearful investors were washed out and the people remaining are the longterm hodlers. It feels like the bandaid has been ripped off. Since the middle of March there has been a lot of (FUD) and pullbacks nearly every week. Sure, we can see more dips, but if crypto is to keep going – it’s reasonable to assume that Bitcoin and many altcoins are going to see more upwards price action in the near term future.

2021-06-03 08:38:47+00:00,Ireland Calls For Strict Crypto Regulations,https://blockzeit.com/ireland-calls-for-strict-crypto-regulations/,"Crypto regulations are a popular subject in many governments right now. China and India are cracking down on crypto and now Ireland calls for crypto regulations as well. European Parliament member and Irish politician Chris MacManus believes that cryptocurrencies pose a risk to financial stability and is calling for government action.  #Crypto Assets a Great Concern, Says Ireland’s Central Bank Enforcer. European Regulators eye rules to manage trading ‘gamification. @business https://t.co/JpG64CXDS1 MacManus said: “In recent times we have seen the volatility of crypto-assets as their value see-saws in the markets. “Under my proposals, all new and existing crypto-assets will require authorisation by a ‘competent authority’ like the Central Bank.” MacManus said that regulations are needed mainly for environmental protection: “Crucially, in deciding whether to grant authorisation the competent authority has to take into account the environmental and energy impact of the proposal.” MacManus uses Bitcoin as as the example for this environmental issue as most due. He mentions that Bitcoin uses the energy of both Argentina and Sweeden combined. However, he fails to mention that 75% of Bitcoin’s energy is from renewable energy. So, calling regulation for environmental reasons is illegitimate considing how cypto is becoming more enviornmentally friendly with proof of stake networks which Ethereum is to become later this year. Furthermore, the issue isn’t necessarily cryptocurrency but the failures of governments and institutions to develop cleaner energy. The flaw is not in fact rooted in cryptocurrency at all. The issue with laws however, is that it leaves room for manipulation by governments. While MacManus claims that regulation is only to prevent harmful mining practices and environmental damage, the fact is that this is pro centralization. Having an authority granting permission for transactions is not the dream of most people in crypto. MacManus also calls for a regulation of stablecoins. He stated: “The EU has proposed regulation mainly in response to the planned emergence of so-called ‘stablecoins’- currencies run by Facebook or others that are linked to the value of the Euro or Dollar or other assets or currencies. These stablecoins are seen as having the potential to be significant enough to pose a threat to financial stability.”” MacManus says that, all crypto assets should require authorisation by “competent authorities like the Central Bank”. MacManus claims his issue with stablecoins is the lack of customer protection. According to Cointelegraph,”MacManus wants the EU’s crypto laws to mandate customer protection policies.” Customer protection is a fair concern to have. It’s one of the biggest issue crypto struggles with – and this could be an upside to regulation. Regulations come at a big cost. Right now, the reason crypto is so profitable is because it’s a new industry. New industries are profitable because they lack regulation. In other words: crypto is in its “wild west” period. This makes the cryptocurrency industry an exciting space to be in, but it also brings high risks, scams and price volatility. If crypto needs more regulation, it has to happen in a way that keeps it decentralized – if that’s at all possible. Decentralization comes with it’s costs like anything. Even though crypto isn’t perfect and has it’s downsides, regulation isn’t going to perfect crypto – it will just change it. And that’s not necessarily a good thing.

2024-04-22 14:24:17+00:00,"Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Forecasts Ethereum Mooning By 5,000%",https://blockzeit.com/ark-invest-ceo-forecasts-ethereum-to-moon-5000-by-2032/,"Previously, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood boldly forecasted Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential climb to $1.5 million per BTC by 2027. She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it.

For longterm investors there is nothing to worry about, says Sheldon Evens in a recent video. As long as you hold and don’t treat Bitcoin as a “get rich quick scheme” the crypto market still looks bullish. “I have some bags that I’ve had since 2015 that I haven’t touched at all. Not even during this market – not even swing trading. I have a hodl portfolio that I do not touch that is my long term store of value that fits the narrative of Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s essential narrative is a long term store of value. Not a short term get rich quick scheme.” Sheldon brings up a tweet from PlanB. It illustrates a really valid point: No one who has held Bitcoin longterm has ever lost money. Nobody who bought #bitcoin and Hodled for 4+ years (200 weeks) ever lost money, EVER. https://t.co/oDeJbCC9hW pic.twitter.com/BCK37uTsbF Sheldon says again: “When you see these sentiment changes, across Youtube, across Twitter – You’ll see it on the faces of Youtubers where they start getting sad when the market starts entering these stages and the expressions on their faces start fading. Because they are way too overexposed to the market and their emotions are getting a hold of them. When you don’t have everything to lose, then you can make objective decisions in the market. And right now – we’re in a stage of extreme fear.” This is one of the best points anyone can make. Why are all these experts so eager to make claims about the bear market? Sheldon couldn’t have answered this question any better. When we see waves of emotions it’s because people have too much to lose. Therefore, it’s important to try to view the situation as logically as possible. Sheldon mentions that at time when the market has made major downside movements is when hedge funds and institutions are ready to invest. He says many of these types of investors want to get in at a time where there is the lowest amount of downside risk. This statement concurs with a recent market intel report from Chainanalysis which states that “whale investors” and institutions have bought around $3 billion worth of Bitcoin in the past weeks. And bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor himself has announced on Twitter several times that his company bought more Bitcoin. Evans also brings up how Apple is currently hiring cryptocurrency experts and PayPal is allowing users to withdraw cryptocurrency from their platform. This shows you that large companies are implementing cryptocurrencies in their corporate strategy. Furthermore, this is a sign that more and more Fortune 500 companies companies believe that cryptocurrencies will play a role in their future. Lastly, Sheldon points out how the U.S. dollar’s inflation is on the rise. He believes this will lead many investors to look for alternatives to the US dollar. Will this lead people to buy Bitcoin? This is. to be seen, but it is likely as Bitcoin is considered to be a hedge to inflation."
2021-05-28 11:14:03+00:00,Raoul Pal Predicts 250k Bitcoin By End Of Year,https://blockzeit.com/raoul-pal-predicts-250k-bitcoin-by-end-of-year/,"Raoul Pal, the Founder and CEO of Real Vision Group, says that the current Bitcoin market reminds him of 2013. He believes that Bitcoin will go to $250,000 by the end of 2021.  Raoul Pal first invested in Bitcoin back in 2013 and experienced the winter of the last bear market as of 2017. Pal who was once a Bitcoin only investor has since become more of an Ethereum bull. Yes, there is a bitcoin revolution but there is a digital asset revolution going on that is beyond incredible. It is very early days, like BTC in 2013, but it's happening. Some will be on the BTC blockchain but the vast majority will not be. 1/ Raoul Pal is one of the most respected financial thinkers in the world. In the early 2000s when he experienced the debt bubble increase, he realized that people’s wealth and financial security was at great risk. He then saw governments try to mitigate the problem by simply printing more money. While Pal agrees the traditional financial and banking systems are very flawed, unlike most, he didn’t want to see the banks go under. This is because he knew older generations would see their life savings and investments be destroyed. He then set out to create his own bank in hopes others would follow in his footsteps. He said: “I was going to set up the world’s safest bank – A bank that only held U.S. treasuries. And that any money on deposit was entirely matched on treasuries that were held at the fed with no rehypothecation. It was kind of a bank outside of the banking system. But setting up a bank is really hard to do.” His acquaintance, Emil Woodsm then told him that Bitcoin could be his answer. Pal stated recently on a podcast: “Crypto comes from a different community. It came from cypherpunks and libertarians. But it started also to attract the attention of finance people, particularly macro investors like myself. Our job is to find assets that represent our views. And we are all without a doubt troubled by debt.” While Pal is not a libertarian himself, he identifies with their passion for crypto and Bitcoin because of the potential that it holds to bring people out of debt. All of this being said, Pal is one of the biggest crypto bulls out there. And recently, Pal talked on the popular Youtube show Crypto Banter and unveiled his shocking prediction for the price of Bitcoin this year. “The market is kind of just moving around in the range of important support levels so it works for me. It’s kind of a general mid market. For me, I love these corrections because they’re out of the way. My projection of Bitcoin by the end of the year is 250k so I think we still have a lot of ground to cover. It looks crazy now but the Bitcoin market is a crazy market.” Yes, you read that correctly! Pal believes we will see $250,000 Bitcoin by the end of the year which is only a few months away. To think that Bitcoin could do this isn’t absurd, but it might be ignoring what Bitcoin did in 2020 after a similar crash in March. When Covid hit and markets crashed, Bitcoin went down to levels around $6,000 all the way up to almost $30,000 in time for the new year. That’s a 5x in price. So, can Bitcoin pull a similar move this year? We have to consider now that the market cap for Bitcoin is much higher now which means that price movement will be harder. But as Pal said “The Bitcoin market is a crazy market.” There is not telling what can happen and he could indeed be correct.

2021-05-26 14:32:41+00:00,Lark Davis: Crypto Bull Market To Continue,https://blockzeit.com/lark-daviscrypto-bull-market-to-continue/,"It’s only half time for bull market. While we’re in a bit of a slump, Lark Davis believes this party is just getting started. In a video just released today, he stated that there are many indicators which show why the Bitcoin bear market is not here.   Lark Davis is worldwide famous YouTuber whith a lot of knowledge of the crypto industry. He recently stated: “I believe we’re in a bearish trend that is part of a wider bull market. What we’re seeing right now is a bull market correction much like what we saw in 2013.” Lark believes that we’re not in uncharted territory. He points to a tweet which Global Macro Investor CEO Raoul Pal made on the 24th. He said: “Makets move in cycles – sometimes they have bearish trends and sometimes they have bullish trends. It all depends on your time frame and what you’re looking at.” 2013 is calling and wants it's mid-cycle bear market back… pic.twitter.com/rFGjtscWsC Lark points out that many in the crypto community are afraid of a multi year bear market where prices continue to go down and crypto finds itself in a liquidity desert without any new investors coming in. During the last bear market crash of 2017, many cryptos saw a recession as high as 90%. However, Lark points out that this is a new market and the while history can rhyme, in markets, history never repeats itself. Lark also brought up the fact that blockchain entrepreneur and investor Michael Saylor organized a meeting with Bitcoin miners and Elon Musk to “accelerate sustainability initiatives worldwide. Yesterday I was pleased to host a meeting between @elonmusk & the leading Bitcoin miners in North America. The miners have agreed to form the Bitcoin Mining Council to promote energy usage transparency & accelerate sustainability initiatives worldwide. https://t.co/EHgLZ9zvDK He remarked interestingly that 75% of Bitcoin is sourced from clean and renewable energy even though Musk failed to mention this in his tweet from two weeks ago when he announced that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin as a payment. Lark said that he believes it’s a good initiative altough he criticized the centralized “mining guilds”. There have been rumors that Bitcoin miners have been selling off massive amounts of Bitcoin. This would be very bearish if the news were true. However, Lark pointed out that while there has been a small sell-off from miners in May, Chinese Bitcoin miners are still continuing to HODL and consolidate their Bitcoin positions. There has only been a slight increase in selling by miners, in spite of reports of Chinese miners panic selling. On chain reality is that miners ramped up selling from 100 BTC a day to 300 BTC a day, which is 600 shy of the total mined daily. #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/HaTe0bkWKu What some don’t understand about cryptocurrency mining is that miners have to sell-off a portion of their earnings to cover their cost of business. So, when we see miners selling their Bitcoin, this is just a part of doing business and has nothing to do with their thoughts on the bullish or bearish trends of Bitcoin. Lark Davis is one of the most reputable YouTubers in the game. His knowledge of technical analysis and the crypto market make him one of the most reliable influencers in the game. He believes that the bull market of 2021 is just taking a small break and that we will likely see continuing growth later on in the year.

2021-05-26 12:06:06+00:00,Hedge Fund Billionaire Ray Dalio Endorses Bitcoin,https://blockzeit.com/hedge-fund-billionaire-ray-dalio-endorses-bitcoin/,"After being critical of cryptocurrencies as a new asset class, hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio now endorses Bitcoin. Ray Dalio announced yesterday that he owns some Bitcoin and that he believes it is a better investment than bonds. This announcement comes after a series of non-stop FUD from institutions and celebrities. “Personally, I’d rather have #bitcoin than a bond"" said @RayDalio. Welcome to the team Ray. We agree.https://t.co/kxcSoAOSsp This is unexpected news considering how Dalio warned the public in May that he feared the US would ban Bitcoin. When Dalio spoke with Yahoo Finance back in March, he said: “Every country treasures its monopoly on controlling the supply and demand. They don’t want other currencies to be operating or competing, because things can get out of control. So I think that it would be very likely that you will have it under a certain set of circumstances outlawed the way gold was outlawed,” This was also a flip-flop so to speak from his statements in January this year. According to Cointelegraph.com, Dalio said: Bitcoin is one hell of an invention.” He made further statements that he was impressed about Bitcoin’s longevity and success being around for more than ten years. It appears the billionaire investor has mixed feelings about Bitcoin and crypto. It wouldn’t be surprising if he comes out later in the month revoking his statements from yesterday however. This could be just like how quickly Elon Musk goes back and forth between positive and negative statements about crypto on Twitter. Spoke with North American Bitcoin miners. They committed to publish current & planned renewable usage & to ask miners WW to do so. Potentially promising. Is it possible these billionaires and celebrities like Musk and Dalio are making these statements to manipulate the market? We can’t verify this for certain, but we can almost be certain they know that their remarks and public statements carry a lot of weight. For Musk and Dalio not to know that they can heavily influence and move markets would be unbelievable. Dalio has also made statements about how he believes the IRS will come heavily after crypto in light of the U.S. going into further debt. Dalio’s remarks seemed to give the whole market a nice nudge after a very turbulent month. Bitcoin found it’s way back up to $40,000 and Ethereum went all the way back up to $2,900. Many other larger caps were also able to get some nice traction yesterday. MATIC went up 100% in a single day getting close back to its all time high. The crypto market has become even more unpredictable in many ways than 2017. Sure, the industry was more volatile back then. However, there were not any influential public figures making statements about Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptos as they do now.

2021-05-23 19:19:11+00:00,Crypto Veterans Calling Possible Bear Market,https://blockzeit.com/crypto-veterans-calling-possible-bear-market/,"There’s no doubt about it. The cryptocurrency market is having a hard time getting it’s feet back. After the historic 50% pullback that Bitcoin did on Wednesday, there are many veteran traders and major influencers who are concerned about the temporary conditions of the market. Some are expecting a crypto bear market. #BTC I don't like what I seeI sold 25% of my $BTC around 38KRe-buying below 30K if the opportunity comesIf we have a market confirmation above 42K I will buy higher pic.twitter.com/0dNULlHfkB As of right now, it looks like Bitcoin might fail to close at crucial support levels that could see it drop back down to 30k. What is my prediction?We just saw a beartrap and that this weekend we actually will see a bullish relief rally for alts and majors.The Key level is 42K for #BTC we must close it or we will continue to slide imo Well 1 is off the table https://t.co/kwGiubiet2 The positive outlook to take from here is that Elliostrades pointed out that if Bitcoin takes another big dip, the best has yet to come. In other words, regardless of the short term conditions of the market, crypto’s future looks promising. The important thing to recognize is that if you zoom out, nearly everyone is bullish on the grand scheme of things. These short term cycles of “bull” and “bear” as we call them are only temporary. And you have to consider that the crypto market has grown explosively both this year and since Bitcoin was first on the market. It seems clear that there is only one direction which is up. In the meantime, we will see a lot of ups, downs, and sideways movements. There will be times where almost everyone in crypto is really shaky and everything is plain boring with no pumps. But this correction is a sign for a healthy market. As Elliostrades mentioned many times in his videos, healthy markets have to have recessions and pullbacks. It’s not a straight rocket to the top ever. If the pumps never ended eventually the whole market would crash to a point where it couldn’t recover. It will likely take time before things heat up again. The market needs to take a break and heal. Unfortunately, it seems like meme coins have done more harm than good. Meme coins created a environment in crypto that didn’t make sense. People were getting 100x gains in a day on coins with zero fundamentals. Markets like this can’t be stable. Hopefully, what will happen in the coming weeks while it might be bearish… is that the market “rinses” itself as Elliostrades says in the tweet above. The market needs to shake projects and tokens which have no value or value proposition. The general public does not understand crypto and the revolutionary technology behind blockchain and DeFi. But in the coming weeks we should see fundamentally strong projects hold up and recover from the crash. At the same time hopefully this rinse will weed out the meme coins which bring no value to the crypto space and the world in general. Even the crypto veterans cannot predict where the crypto market is going. It is likely though that this is another shake out or a healthy pullback as the market has run very hot in the past months and year. One needs to keep in mind that many institutions have purchased cryptocurrencies in this past year. The question is, are they selling, buying or holding during this dip? For one we know – Tesla has not sold its Bitcoin. At least according to Elon Musks tweets. And Michael Saylor has been using this dip to buy more Bitcoin. It will be interesting to see what the other institutions will do. If you enjoyed reading this article, you might also want to check out What Is A Supercycle And Can We See One?"
2021-05-22 09:52:28+00:00,Iran Pursues Illegal Bitcoin Miners Because Of High Energy Consumption,https://blockzeit.com/iran-pursues-illegal-bitcoin-miners-because-of-high-energy-consumption/,"Iranian Government pursues illegal Bitcoin miners due to high energy consumption. Iran is a leading spot in the world for crypto mining.  In fact, approximately 4.5% of all crypto mining globally takes place in Iran. And what is more interesting is that a significant percentage of this mining is illicit. Now, the Iranian government is reporting an excessive amount of energy consumption. And they are pointing towards Bitcoin and crypto mining as a major cause. According to an article from Bloomberg.com, The Iranian Students’ News Agency reported that the Ministry of Intelligence in Iran has begun organizing task forces to bring down “underground” crypto miners. An energy grid operator in Iran called Tavinir already cut power in parts of Iran in order to manually reduce the excessive energy consumption. Iran has become a hot spot in a way for crypto mining because of the affordable rates of energy use. People from China and other parts of the world come to Iran to set up business for this reason. According to an article from wsau.com, the energy consumption is quite excessive as we’ve mentioned. An excerpt from the report reads, “The electricity being used by miners in Iran would require the equivalent of around 10 million barrels of crude oil each year to generate, around 4% of total Iranian oil exports in 2020.” While there is a lot of illegal crypto miners, crypto mining in Iran is totally a legitimate industry. And crypto mining in Iran is a fine example of many unparalleled events happening in crypto right now. One might be familiar with the United States sanctions against Iran. These sanctions which were passed into law by the U.S. government in 1979, outlawed commerce of any kind with the nation of Iran. These sanctions also make it difficult for Iranians to send money into and out of the country. However, the catch here is that Iran’s crypto mining produces a significant amount of Bitcoin to the global supply. And there are American traders no doubt who are buying cryptocurrency. So, this is one example of how cryptocurrency is bypassing the laws of government regulations. Proof of stake networks can resolve this mining related energy crisis. They allow holders of tokens to run their own nodes and rewards them with financial incentives. With millions of people running their own nodes and working as validators this will remove many obstacles including government regulation and environmental impact. It will be interesting to see how the crypto industry changes as mining hopefully becomes a thing of the past and the crypto industry is allowed to continue to flourish.

2021-05-17 07:39:30+00:00,Bitcoin Price Plummets As Musk Threatens To Sell,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-price-plummets-as-musk-threatens-to-sell/,"Nerve-wrecking times for Bitcoin holders: The Bitcoin price fell sharply to $42,000 dollars as Elon Musk indicated on Twitter that he might sell Tesla’s Bitcoin. Just last week, Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla will not accept Bitcoin as a payment. Musk has been going back and forth on Bitcoin which has caused volatility in the Bitcoin price. Just last week Musk announced in a tweet that Tesla will no longer accept Bitcoin. His reasoning behind it lies on environmental concerns as he believes that mining Bitcoin would cost too much energy. Although he confirmed that he will not sell any Bitcoin that Tesla is currently holding, the backlash on twitter was huge as Bitcoin enthusiasts responded with hate and disappointment. Tesla & Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/YSswJmVZhP The backlash on Twitter was huge upon this tweet. For which reason some people took Musks side, saying that they would understand if Musk would now even sell Tesla’s Bitcoin. And look at this – Musk replied! This tweet on Sunday, May 16th sent Bitcoin prices tumbling to $42,000 a 3 month low. But this is not all yet, as Musk tweeted again 12 hours later, re-insuring that Tesla has not sold any Bitcoin. To clarify speculation, Tesla has not sold any Bitcoin Again this affected Bitcoin prices. Making it rise back to $45,000. At this point, Musk has been single handedly affecting the Bitcoin price just by sending out tweets. For Bitcoin maximalists this of course is frustrating and they do not hold back in their disappointment on Twitter. As Musk is distancing himself from Bitcoin, he is still holding his support for Dogecoin. He recently tweeted that he is working with Dogecoin developers on improving the system transaction efficiency of Dogecoin, thus making it more energy efficient. In another tweet Musk asked whether Tesla should accept Dogecoin. Dogecoin has been a big hype in recent months, however, it is difficult to understand why Musk is supporting this coin. Doge has an unlimited cap. Every day 14 million new Dogecoins are mined, unlike Bitcoin that has a cap at 21 million Bitcoins. It appears that Musk does enjoy the attention that he is receiving through his tweets. He has supported Dogecoin and Doge fans love him. He has been pro Bitcoin and the Bitcoin fans loved him. But there are two ends to a stick. Now that Musk announced that Tesla will not accept Bitcoin, many Bitcoin maximalists turned on him. It is to hope that this hate and disappointment from the crypto community will not sway Musk to turn his back completely on crypto as this would hurt the growth and adoption of crypto. Furthermore, it is important that Musk does not keep on tweeting every thought he has about crypto as it has proven to show that it affects prices. Musk has been accused for market manipulation before as he tweeted about Tesla stock. As the stock market is regulated, the SEC had the power to mute him. Unfortunately, this is different in the unregulated crypto world where prices are still heavily affected by social media, influencers and mass mentality."
2021-05-15 12:38:31+00:00,Tesla No Longer Accepts Bitcoin Payments,https://blockzeit.com/tesla-no-longer-accepts-bitcoin-payments/,"In a highly unexpected move, the CEO of Tesla has made public that Tesla no longer accepts Bitcoin as a form of payment for their services. Tesla & Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/YSswJmVZhP The crypto community was mostly caught with shock. As one can see in Musk’s letter to the Twitter community, Musk expressed his concern of Bitcoin’s environmental impact. It is true, Bitcoin mining’s CO2 emissions are heavy. However, it does seem a bit strange. Musk who is the CEO of the most profitable electric car company in the world just now realized this? This is highly unlikely because this is the most common known fact about Bitcoin. Almost everyone even those who know nothing about crypto have heard about Bitcoin’s environmental impact. So why would Musk just now be addressing this issue? Is it possible that shareholders in the company wanted Musk to pull out for the sake of Tesla’s image? Were the other outside influences that pressured Musk? These are all possibilities. At the end of the day nobody knows. But what we do know is that the crypto market took a sizeable dip. Bitcoin dropped all the way to $48,000 and Ethereum dropped below $3600 from it’s all time high above $4200 it made yesterday. Since their short dips, they’ve nicely recovered. Hopefully more bearish news isn’t released that could bring a further dip. However, many alts took a big dip and are still hovering at low support levels. One token which has been totally not effected by this dip is Kusama, the sister network to Polka dot. It’s up nearly 30% since yesterday. This goes to show projects with strong fundamentals that are major caps can survive and even continue to build even when the market is shaky. To learn more about Polkadot and Kusama check out this video from yesterday by Elliotrades: POLKADOT COULD MAKE YOU HUGE GAINS!!! CROWDLOANS EXPLAINED. So, hopefully we will see a nice recovery and some day soon alts will have their day. I just bought some more #bitcoin, thanks Elon! Many in the crypto community are very angry at Elon Musk for his recent announcement. However, some have taken a different approach. Lark Davis, a popular YouTuber and crypto influencer, believes that this is a great opportunity to by Bitcoin while it is at a discount price. Some are wondering if these recent bearish events are going to bring about the end of the bull cycle. However, as we’ve discussed before, whales aren’t selling their Bitcoin. And neither is Musk. We’re in a totally different ball game than the 2017 bull run. There was hardly any involvement from celebrity culture and institutions in the market. Now, these factors can bring either really bullish or really bearish news for crypto. When Ethereum becomes a proof of stake network later this year, maybe Elon Musk will allow Ethereum payments for Teslas? Musk Said that he will look into cryptocurrencies which produce less than 1% of Bitcoin’s CO2 emissions.  "

Elliot, the founder of EllioTrades is one of the most reputable influencers in the crypto community. He has been in the game for a long time and has an understanding about this market that few people do. He is battle proven and worked his way up through the last bear market while developing his own cryptocurrency project called SuperFarm. In a recent video, EllioTrades, explained why he believes that the bull cycle is not over and why there are many “parabolic gains yet to come”: One of the reasons Elliot firmly believes we are not in a bear market is because big whales holding Bitcoin are not selling. Elliot said that if big whales had the suspicion that this were the case – we would see them selling. Additionally, he mentions that this bearish pull back we are seeing right now, is actually the sign of a healthy market and that every bull cycle should see events like this. For those that saw the crash in the last bull cycle, some have carried scars along with them. They are so afraid of another crash that they will end up panic selling and abandoning crypto all together. However, many have predicted that this bear market will not be nearly as catastrophic as the last. This is especially true with major alts (altcoins) and Bitcoin. Sure, we’ll likely see a 20% or 30% recession, however something like 80% would be highly unlikely in investments like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major alts which now hold strong market positions. Furthermore, institutions are always trying to spread FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt). Therefore, you should be suspicious of any news you hear about crypto. This doesn’t mean that you should be unreasonable, but the fact is that banks want all holders to sell their Ethereum and Bitcoin during dips so they can buy them up. It’s a very dirty trick. The final point ElliosTrades makes in his new video is that huge dips in markets are the greatest opportunity for “parabolic gains” as he calls them. He says, “I believe these asstet prices will come roaring back. This is a game of wealth creation that is unavailable anywhere else other than here in cryptoland.” In short, the bull run for crypto is not over yet. When the market is boring it is when there is the most opportunity. This pattern has repeated time and time again in crypto. Just last September was one of the most brutal months in crypto since the last crash. However, many saw gains as high as 50x with investments they accumulating during this unexciting and unpleasant moment in the market. It is possible the market could still face another leg down before the next leg up. But the most important thing to understand is that many of these cryptocurrency projects have developed utilities that will revolutionize finance and technology. There is little doubt that blockchain and crypto will lay the foundations for the next era of the internet. Fluctuations in the highly volatile market of cryptocurrencies are expected. However, as more and more use cases for blockchain and crypto are developing, it is to expect that crypto assets will grow in the coming months and years.

2021-04-27 10:02:24+00:00,Has Bitcoin Proven Itself As a Means of Payment in Everyday Life in Switzerland?,https://blockzeit.com/bitcoin-as-a-means-of-payment-in-everyday-life-in-switzerland/,"Bitcoin is the first and most broadly known cryptocurrency in the world with over 10 years of existence. Being available for so long now we decided to look into how it is used as a payment method in everyday life in Switzerland. Our research shows: There are still very few companies in Switzerland that accept payment in cryptocurrency. However, adoption is accelerating rapidly.  In Switzerland there are several ways to acquire Bitcoin. They range from stock and cryptocurrency platforms such as eToro and Kriptomat to online banking platforms such as Revolut. One of the easiest ways to purchase Bitcoin, however, is through specific Bitcoin vending machines that you can find throughout Switzerland. Since 2018, the Swiss Federal Railway (short SBB) decided to offer Bitcoin purchasing at all of their ticket vending machines. All you need therefore, is a Bitcoin wallet and a Swiss phone number. You feed the machine with cash and scan the QR code with your Bitcoin wallet app and within a few minutes the Bitcoin balance will be available in your wallet. Although acquiring Bitcoin is made easy, the transaction fees are rather high. Buying cryptocurrencies in Switzerland is relatively  easy – so what to do with the newly purchased Bitcoin? Can they even be used in daily life?  My research shows: Even though cryptocurrencies are revolutionizing the digital world and gaining broader acceptance, there are very few places in Switzerland that allow you to pay with cryptocurrencies. And yet, the trend shows that more and more companies are willing to accept this new form of digital payment. Leading this trend is the city and Kanton of Zug. The city of Zug allowed payments in Bitcoin as early as 2016 and was the first city in Switzerland to accept Bitcoin for a number of state and city official services. As of 2021 the citizens of Zug are even allowed to pay their taxes in Bitcoin. Hence, Zug is the first Kanton in Switzerland to accept cryptocurrencies as tax payment. The openness of Zug towards cryptocurrencies has been the reason for a large migration of blockchain companies, such as Ethereum and Cardano,  to move to this area of Switzerland, giving it the name “Crypto Valley’. Digitec Galaxus, a large online retailer, jumped onto the crypto-train two years ago and allows customers to pay with cryptocurrencies as of March 2019. And just last week, the Swiss insurance giant Axa announced that they will accept payments in Bitcoin. The reason for the integration of this new payment method is the digital transformation which was strongly accelerated by the COVID crises and led to a boom in cryptocurrencies. Click here to find a list of shops that accept Bitcoin in Switzerland. In the past years people started to rethink the use of cryptocurrencies. The broader market no longer sees the use of Bitcoin as a currency, but more as a store of value, similar to gold. So why do more and more companies decide to accept Bitcoin as a payment method? On one end it surely is a part of their marketing and PR strategy. Being involved in the trend of cryptocurrencies makes them appear futuristic and aligned with current technology trends. On the other end accepting payments in Bitcoin has its advantages, such as attractive exchange rates with other currencies and low transaction fees for transfers into foreign countries. It will be interesting to see if people will actually use this new form of payment and if this will become the norm. We will certainly know more in the coming months. But one thing is clear: the cryptocurrency hype is growing here in Switzerland, and yet it is still a mystery to most people."

She anchored her projection to the growing institutional adoption of the digital asset via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the impending supply crunch following the halving due to the anticipated stronger investor demand for BTC. Should her prophecy come to fruition, it could mean over 2,100% increase in the price of Bitcoin from its present value at $66K. If that’s already mind-blowing, wait until you learn about her projection for Ethereum. More astonishing than Wood’s outlook for Bitcoin was her prediction for Ethereum. According to The Motley Fool, the Ark Invest supremo believes Ethereum has the potential to reach $166,000 per ETH by 2032. Crunching the numbers, it would translate to more than 5,000% gain after eight years from ETH’s current $3,200 valuation. This would also pump its market cap from the prevailing $384.86 billion to $20 trillion by the targeted year. In comparison, Gold, which reigns supreme among the top tradable assets in the world by market cap, has a total valuation of $15.82 trillion. In the same rankings, Bitcoin sits in the ninth place with the value of its circulating supply going around $1.30 trillion. Ethereum snags the 25th spot in the hierarchy with its abovementioned market capitalization. The very bullish view of Wood for Ethereum lay in its blockchain’s innate advantages. First off, she highlighted its network’s capability to provide developers with means to create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Bitcoin’s ecosystem only allows BTC mining, Ordinals, and Runes generation at the moment. Another leverage Ethereum holds is its shift to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the 2022 Merge as opposed to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining since its inception. The same upgrade is foreseen by developers as a catalyst for Ethereum’s continuous expansion, especially in the Web3 space. In addition to these, The Motley Fool reminded everyone of Ethereum’s widespread recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency. Right now, it is one of the cryptos greenlit by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The source said that its status could help the bid of several spot Ethereum ETF applications for regulatory approval in the US. But then again, it should be recalled that Ethereum is also under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of late for its possible reclassification as a security under US laws. This might crumble all hope for the approval of spot Ether ETFs this year. The scenario painted by Wood certainly offers an enticing long-term play for Ethereum. However, The Motley Fool warned of the CEO’s tendency to make the wrong calls recently. This is further demonstrated by her company’s inability to recover the prices its stock lost in the past couple of years despite the S&P 500’s 76% rally in the last five years. Ark Invest shares fell from a top of over $137 in 2021 to $42.25 at the start of the trading week on Monday."

2024-04-22 12:20:12+00:00,WEF Points Out “Pain Points” Wholesale CBDCs Aim To Address,https://blockzeit.com/wef-points-out-pain-points-of-wholesale-cbdcs/,"The World Economic Forum published a report, titled “Modernizing Financial Markets with Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC),” on April 16. The paper delved into the ongoing initiatives and use cases of these financial instruments. It also identified several “pain points” that needed to be addressed regarding the matter. According to the WEF, a huge majority of central banks worldwide have, in some way, already dipped their toes in wCBDCs. The effort aims to streamline the payment processes and the security of transactions among financial institutions. “Over 98% of the global economy’s central banks are researching, piloting or deploying central bank digital currency (CBDC),” the WEF pointed out. “There is an opportunity to harness this innovation in central bank money to enhance systemically important payments and securities transactions between financial institutions.” The non-governmental institution likewise advocated for the promotion of “financial inclusivity” between the players in the field for the purpose of paving the way for a more resilient global economy.” The document identified eight industry challenges plaguing the financial system. Four of them were deemed “key pain points” that were “ripe for modernization using wCBDCs.” The WEF opined these should be “considered as the near-term focus area” of wholesale CBDC programs. The first issue mentioned was the “disparate settlement cycles” in cross-border settlements due to the inadequate harmonization of settlement cycles globally. The WEF explained this was due to the limited operating hours of most real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS). A wCDBC could address this dilemma by establishing a global settlement window with almost 24/7 access. The second cause of concern lay in “operational risk and settlement failures.” The WEF said these could be due to market volatility, liquidity constraints, data quality problems, and too much focus on post-trade manual processes. Wholesale CBDCs would allow the automation of settlement procedures while mitigating the associated risks. Other pain points enumerated in the report where wCBDCs could play a crucial role were the growing foreign exchange (forex) settlement risk and the lack of a tokenized credit risk-free settlement medium. The WEF recommended efficient “payment versus payment” (PvP) mechanisms to go around such a predicament in forex. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants like Central Securities Depositories (CSD) and digital asset exchanges could help “deliver composable and programmable credit risk-free cash to eliminate counterparty risk.” “This report offers key findings to facilitate further exploration of wCBDC and hopes to serve as a foundational step towards a more efficient, responsible, and secure future for financial markets,” the WEF paper concluded."
2024-04-22 08:33:11+00:00,Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Potentially Coming Up,https://blockzeit.com/dogecoin-bullish-reversal-potentially-coming-up/,"We may be in for a major treat on April 20.Besides the #Bitcoin (#BTC) halving, it will be highlighted by the #Dogecoin (#DOGE) Day event and 420 festivities in the #CannabisIndustry.https://t.co/oLmt5UnMEv The much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving finally hit, bringing along with it a very bullish outlook from industry players and watchers. The same event also signaled an important event within the Dogecoin space as the dog-themed coin celebrated its annual DOGE Day or D-Day festivities. We are officially in the 4th epoch of #Bitcoin (#BTC).As expected, massive selling pressure ensued hours before the #bitcoinhalvingday, crashing prices to $59K.A major recovery above $65K followed as traders and investors capitalized on the dip.https://t.co/HQyUqRV9rU Following these milestones in the cryptocurrency market was a new pattern emerging on the charts, which painted a positive picture for DOGE in the near future. According to Ali Martinez (@ali_charts on X), the TD Sequentials just flashed a buy signal of DOGE’s 24-hour range during the weekend. The TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the #Dogecoin daily chart, indicating a potential upswing of one to four days for $DOGE! pic.twitter.com/GOmTCp0wCw For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the analytical tool, the TD Sequential helps spot the potential end of a trend. It roots out its likely exhaustion, which could indicate a possible reversal in prices. At prevailing market conditions, Dogecoin may finally be on its way to recovering the bullish momentum it lost between the last week of March and the first week of April. Martinez didn’t provide a price target for his prediction. However, the consensus is eyeing a possible top over the $0.20 territory, which the OG meme coin strayed away from nearly two weeks ago as bears took over. As of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC on Monday, Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 range, displaying more than a 1% loss on the 24-hour frame, a roughly 3% drop on the seven-day period, and a nearly 2% dip across a one-month span. Zooming out the chart on a one-year frame, however, reveals around a whopping 104% gain for the crypto asset. Within this bracket, DOGE made a major recovery from a $0.05 low to a $0.22 high. By far, the highest point that the crypto achieved was on May 8, 2021, wherein it peaked at $0.7376. That’s 78% higher than its value now. Amid the celebrations and renewed optimism on Dogecoin were reports proliferating on social media about DOGE airdrops. Unfortunately, these proved to be nothing but fake news circulated by bad actors on the market. Get ready for $Doge Airdrop!No, no, no, there is no #Dogecoin airdrop, there will never be any Airdrops for it. Its a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ pic.twitter.com/JaFvsvDgso A particular site identified by the DOGE community that has been actively spreading misinformation was dogechain.com. One member named Mishaboar on X claimed that the site has been spoofing dogechain.info for some time now. Dear #Dogecoin, remember also to stay away from the dogechain dot com domain – it was used in the past for spoofing the .info website, leading to people leaking their e-mails and passwords. The red flags raised by this copycat site and other related platforms have the potential to steal the personal and financial information of hapless victims through a well-orchestrated phishing scheme."
