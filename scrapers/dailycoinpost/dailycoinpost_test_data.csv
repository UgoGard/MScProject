2024-04-22 09:45:37+00:00,Swiss Advocates Push for Bitcoin Inclusion in Central Bank Reserves,https://dailycoinpost.com/swiss-advocates-push-for-bitcoin-inclusion-in-central-bank-reserves/,"A movement spearheaded by Swiss Bitcoin enthusiasts, led by Yves Bennaïm, is underway to introduce a referendum aimed at amending the Swiss constitution. Their proposal seeks to compel the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to incorporate Bitcoin into its currency reserves alongside gold, local media reports. The proposed constitutional amendment is concise yet carries significant implications. It intends to revise the clause mandating the SNB to “build up sufficient currency reserves from its earnings; part of these reserves shall be held in gold,” to include “and Bitcoin.” Despite its brevity, this alteration could precipitate a substantial transformation in the nation’s fiscal management. Yves Bennaïm, a prominent figure in the Swiss crypto community and a board member of the Bitcoin Association Switzerland, emphasized that the initiative transcends mere asset diversification. He views it as a strategic maneuver to “preserve our sovereignty and neutrality” amidst a volatile global economy. Bennaïm aims to spark a broader conversation about Switzerland’s future financial trajectory. Support for the initiative extends beyond grassroots activism. Luzius Meisser, President of the asset management division at Bitcoin Suisse, lends credence to the proposal. Meisser contends that Bitcoin offers long-term resilience compared to traditional investments in euros and dollars, which are vulnerable to inflationary pressures. He suggests that embracing Bitcoin could signify Switzerland’s financial autonomy from major central banks like the European Central Bank. The initiative has garnered attention from various quarters of the financial sector. Leon Curti, Head of Research at Digital Asset Solutions, observes Bitcoin’s evolving status in global markets, suggesting that its recent classification as a commodity by the US Securities and Exchange Commission could facilitate its inclusion in SNB reserves. Academic endorsement comes from Professor Gunther Schnabl, leading the Institute for Economic Policy at the University of Leipzig. Schnabl advocates for Bitcoin as a hedge against rising government debt and default risks in industrialized nations, proposing it as a valuable addition to SNB’s foreign currency reserves. Nevertheless, critics caution against Bitcoin’s historical volatility and lingering regulatory uncertainties. They argue that such characteristics may not align with the conservative strategies traditionally favored by national central banks. Two years prior, Thomas Jordan, the outgoing SNB Chairman, rebuffed a similar proposal, citing Bitcoin’s inability to meet currency reserve requirements. The SNB’s current stance remains unclear amidst evolving regulatory and economic dynamics. Luzius Meisser speculates on the potential windfall Switzerland could have reaped had it pursued an aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy earlier. He estimates that had the SNB commenced buying CHF 1 billion worth of Bitcoin monthly since 2022, Switzerland’s reserves could have been enriched by around 30 billion francs ($32.9 billion) today. In Switzerland, any citizen can initiate a national referendum to amend the constitution by gathering 100,000 valid signatures. The outcome of this referendum could not only shape Switzerland’s financial strategy but also set a precedent for other nations. As the SNB braces for its upcoming Annual General Meeting, all eyes are on how it will respond to this unprecedented proposal. Bitcoin Maximalist and Toxic to our banking and monetary system.

2024-04-18 16:45:31+00:00,$1.72 Billion Worth of Bitcoin Shifted to Accumulation Addresses Following Drop Below $63K: Data,https://dailycoinpost.com/1-72-billion-worth-of-bitcoin-shifted-to-accumulation-addresses-following-drop-below-63k-data/,"In a notable development, Bitcoin inflows to accumulation addresses have surged to a historic peak, totaling 27.7k BTC. Volatility has been a consistent feature around each Bitcoin halving event. As the next halving approaches, Bitcoin experienced a downturn of over 10% in the past week, dipping under $60k. However, despite these fluctuations, the trend of accumulation persists among Bitcoin holders. Recent analysis by renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlights a substantial movement of more than 27,700 BTC, valued at roughly $1.72 billion, into accumulation addresses following Bitcoin’s drop below the $63,000 threshold. Over 27,700 $BTC, worth around $1.72 billion, have flown into accumulation addresses as #Bitcoin dropped below $63,000! pic.twitter.com/ksrk0qNp41 — Ali (@ali_charts) April 18, 2024  This influx underscores a strong interest from investors in accumulating Bitcoin, potentially in anticipation of future price appreciation. This trend is further corroborated by CryptoQuant’s latest report, indicating that Bitcoin inflows to accumulation addresses have surged to a new record high, surpassing the previous peak of 25,100 BTC noted on March 22, 2024. Accumulation addresses are identified based on specific criteria, including the absence of outgoing transactions, a balance exceeding 10 BTC, exclusion of accounts linked to centralized exchanges or miners, reception of more than two incoming transactions, and only one outgoing transaction within the last seven years. These metrics suggest a notable increase in Bitcoin holdings within addresses associated with long-term holding strategies, reflecting a growing confidence among investors. An intriguing analysis by prominent trader ‘Rekt’ indicates that Bitcoin’s ongoing correction phase may be nearing its end. This suggests that the market could be entering a re-accumulation phase post-halving, during which Bitcoin is expected to establish a range low before trading sideways, both leading up to and following the event. Historical data indicates that this re-accumulation phase typically extends over several months, with Bitcoin maintaining a sideways trajectory. Drawing parallels to previous halving cycles, Bitcoin remained range-bound for approximately five months following both the 2016 and 2020 halving events. If historical patterns repeat, the market could stabilize around elevated levels, hovering in the high $50k range until around October.

2024-04-17 21:03:21+00:00,Hong Kong’s Spot Bitcoin ETFs Set to Attract $1 Billion in Assets: Bloomberg Analysis,https://dailycoinpost.com/hong-kongs-spot-bitcoin-etfs-set-to-attract-1-billion-in-assets-bloomberg-analysis/,"Hong Kong emerges as a front-runner with its new spot Bitcoin and Ether Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), poised to gather up to $1 billion in assets within the first two years, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. However, competition with US counterparts, which amassed over $28 billion in the initial quarter, poses a significant challenge. Mainland China investors probably won’t be eligible to buy Hong Kong-listed spot bitcoin and ether ETFs as they are barred from buying virtual assets. There are some other routes they could try but they less used channels and could be shut down, via note from @RebeccaSin_SK pic.twitter.com/OoHiZ6c9HJ — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 17, 2024  Despite the optimistic outlook, regulatory barriers, particularly concerning investors from Mainland China, cast a shadow over the forecast. Balchunas notes that Mainland China investors might be excluded from purchasing Hong Kong-listed spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs due to restrictions on virtual asset acquisition. Rebecca Sin of Bloomberg further elaborates on the challenges, highlighting the limited utilization of the $50,000 annual remittance quota for retail investors from Mainland China, primarily due to regulatory and practical complexities. Additionally, institutional investors face stringent conditions, with slim prospects of approval for the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) quota for virtual asset ETFs in the current regulatory landscape. Nevertheless, the introduction of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs signifies a significant milestone for Hong Kong’s financial sector. Sin emphasizes the potential, stating that these ETFs could amass up to $1 billion in assets under management, contingent upon infrastructure enhancements and ecosystem expansion supporting digital assets. Presently, the Asia-Pacific region hosts Bitcoin ETFs totaling $250 million across five funds in Hong Kong and Australia. CSOP’s Bitcoin Futures ETF (3066 HK) leads in Hong Kong, launched in late 2022 with $121 million in assets under management. The management fees for the new ETFs are estimated to range between 1-2%. Comparatively, CSOP’s existing Bitcoin and Ether Futures ETFs levy a 2% management fee alongside an additional estimated 2% in other expenses. In contrast, Samsung’s Bitcoin Futures ETF offers a more competitive fee structure at 0.95%, a factor crucial for investor consideration. Balchunas underscores the broader implications for Hong Kong’s position in the global ETF market, noting a projected $1 billion in assets within the initial two years. However, he cautions that infrastructure improvements are pivotal for achieving this target, affirming Hong Kong’s role as an ETF leader in the Asia region. Despite regulatory constraints in neighboring markets like Mainland China, Hong Kong emerges as a pivotal hub for cryptocurrency investments in Asia. With trading set to commence on April 30, all eyes are on Hong Kong as these ETFs debut. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $60,844.

2024-04-17 10:48:12+00:00,Bitcoin Faces Setback as Federal Reserve Holds Off on Rate Cuts,https://dailycoinpost.com/bitcoin-faces-setback-as-federal-reserve-holds-off-on-rate-cuts/,"The recent stance of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell during a panel discussion had significant repercussions on various financial fronts, with Bitcoin being one of the notable players affected. Powell reaffirmed the central bank’s dedication to a cautious monetary policy, despite positive economic indicators. His remarks emphasized the importance of maintaining current interest rates due to the limited progress in meeting the Fed’s inflation target, triggering reactions across financial markets, including the cryptocurrency arena. Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, experienced a notable drop of nearly 8% in its price over the week, settling around $63,941. This decline correlated with Powell’s indication regarding the future direction of interest rates. ⚠️SUMMARY OF POWELL’S SPEECH AT THE WASHINGTON FORUM: 1.

Powell is prepared to leave rates at… pic.twitter.com/AB4BypYWLl — Jesse Cohen (@JesseCohenInv) April 16, 2024  Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated sensitivity to movements in interest rates, with investors interpreting higher rates as signaling a less conducive environment for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Investors and analysts had anticipated potential rate cuts in response to strong economic indicators such as robust job growth and higher-than-expected retail sales. However, Powell’s suggestion that rates might remain elevated for a longer period than previously thought dashed hopes of immediate monetary easing, impacting market sentiments. The response from the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin, underscores its volatility and susceptibility to macroeconomic factors. While some investors perceive cryptocurrencies as a hedge against traditional financial instruments, the price movements in response to statements from central bankers underscore the interconnectedness between traditional and digital asset markets. Powell’s indication that rate cuts might be delayed until later in the year, if at all, has led to a reassessment of investment strategies. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which typically influences supply dynamics and investor sentiment, has been overshadowed by bearish sentiment stemming from the Fed’s policy outlook. As the Federal Reserve’s next meeting approaches on April 30 and May 1, investors are closely monitoring developments for insights into the central bank’s future actions. Analysts have adjusted their forecasts, pushing back expectations for rate cuts and reducing the likelihood of multiple cuts within the year. The absence of mention of rate cuts in recent statements by Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson further underscores the cautious approach taken by the central bank. Jefferson reiterated the importance of maintaining a tight monetary policy and emphasized the Fed’s commitment to data-dependent decision-making. Powell’s remarks on the central bank’s monetary policy stance have reverberated across financial markets, including the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin’s price response to Powell’s statements underscores its sensitivity to macroeconomic factors and highlights the ongoing uncertainty surrounding its future trajectory.

The alternative cryptocurrency market experienced even harsher blows, with numerous assets seeing double-digit declines. The primary catalyst for this downturn was escalating tensions between Iran and Israel. BTC’s Volatility Persists Just two days prior, Bitcoin maintained a relatively stable position above $70,000, briefly testing $71,000. However, the situation took a turn for the worse on Friday evening following statements from high-ranking officials of the US central bank, indicating no immediate plans for interest rate cuts. In a matter of minutes, Bitcoin’s price plunged by $5,000 to $6,000, settling at $65,000. Interestingly, this decline coincided with a broader downturn in financial markets, including a 4% drop in the price of gold.  Bitcoin managed a partial recovery on Saturday morning, reaching slightly above $67,000. However, renewed tensions between Iran and Israel swiftly reversed these gains, causing another drop in the cryptocurrency’s value. The asset hit a multi-week low of slightly under $60,000 on Bitstamp, resulting in over $700 million in liquidations. While it has since rebounded to around $65,000, the market remains volatile, particularly with limited trading opportunities. Bitcoin’s market capitalization has shrunk by approximately $130 billion since Friday, now standing at $1.270 trillion. Concurrently, its dominance over alternative coins has increased by roughly 2%. Altcoins Face Significant Declines As is often the case during sharp declines in Bitcoin’s value, most alternative coins also suffered losses, some even more severe over the past 48 hours. While some assets have experienced minor recoveries, many remain deeply in the red for a second consecutive day. Several cryptocurrencies, including SOL, XRP, DOGE, TON, ADA, AVAX, SHIB, DOT, and ETH, continue to show double-digit declines. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization dropped from nearly $2.8 trillion on Friday morning to approximately $2.330 trillion by Saturday evening. Although it has since recovered around $100 billion, the market remains down by 5% for the day. Bitcoin Maximalist and Toxic to our banking and monetary system.

2024-04-12 11:28:43+00:00,Bitcoin Weekly Outlook: BTC’s Trading Sideways Leaves Investors Puzzled,https://dailycoinpost.com/bitcoin-weekly-outlook-btcs-trading-sideways-leaves-investors-puzzled/,"Bitcoin’s price has been ensconced around the $70,000 mark for weeks, resulting in a period of lateral movement that’s left traders scratching their heads. This lack of definitive movement offers little insight into where BTC might be headed next. However, amidst this uncertainty, there are potential signals indicating a forthcoming shift, including a possible retracement below $60,000, which could serve as a strategic buying opportunity ahead of the fourth halving event. Over the past month, Bitcoin has exhibited a sideways trajectory, failing to break free from its consolidation phase. This scenario bears resemblance to a similar pattern observed between mid-December and mid-January. During that period, Bitcoin underwent a sweep of both range highs and lows, essentially gathering liquidity on both ends before embarking on a decisive upward trajectory. A notable parallel is the occurrence of a sweep of range lows on January 23, propelling Bitcoin’s price into a weekly imbalance zone extending from $38,435 to $39,996. Presently, a comparable imbalance is evident at the bottom, spanning from $53,120 to $59,111. If historical patterns repeat themselves, Bitcoin may dip into this range before clarifying its directional bias. The upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving event, scheduled for April 19, looms as a significant factor contributing to Bitcoin’s current consolidation phase. Historically, this event has precipitated considerable market movement, often characterized by rallies leading up to the halving followed by corrections shortly thereafter. Additionally, macroeconomic dynamics play a crucial role in shaping Bitcoin’s price trajectory. With prevailing high interest rates driving capital towards safer assets, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, alongside stablecoins, stand to benefit. The rise in Bitcoin dominance reflects this capital rotation trend.  Despite Bitcoin reclaiming its 2021 highs, metrics such as relative realized profit indicate a lower profit-taking intensity compared to previous years. The Short-term Holder (STH) Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Momentum Indicator offers insights into the unrealized profit or loss of recent market entrants, potentially indicating moments of capitulation or profit-taking.  Despite short-term uncertainties, the long-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin remains robust, supported by on-chain metrics and macroeconomic trends. However, traders must remain vigilant amidst the current consolidation phase. A breach of the $45,156 level could trigger a significant sell-off, potentially challenging the bullish narrative and leading to further downside.

2024-04-11 11:05:45+00:00,GBTC Records Lowest Daily Outflow Amid BTC Price Surge,https://dailycoinpost.com/gbtc-records-lowest-daily-outflow-amid-btc-price-surge/,"On April 10, GBTC observed a remarkable dip in outflows, marking a stark contrast to the average daily outflows witnessed over the past four months. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) documented its lowest net outflow at $17.5 million since its transition to a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), as reported by Farside Investors data on Wednesday. This development comes in the wake of a statement by Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein, indicating that the company’s fund is approaching a state of “equilibrium” regarding its outflows. Data from Farside reveals that GBTC experienced combined net outflows surpassing $450 million on Monday and Tuesday, contributing to over $16 billion in cumulative outflows in the last three months. However, these outflows decelerated to $17.5 million on Wednesday, a significant drop from the $154.9 million recorded on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETF registered net inflows of $76.3 million, BlackRock’s IBIT attracted $33.3 million, and Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF observed inflows amounting to $24.3 million. Additionally, Ark Invest’s ARKB saw $7.3 million of net inflows. Collectively, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including Grayscale, witnessed net inflows of $123.7 million, marking an improvement after experiencing cumulative net outflows amounting to $19.4 million on April 9. Sonnenshein noted that the anticipation of reaching a balance in outflows follows a phase of substantial capital flight driven by a mix of switch trades and settlements from bankruptcies like FTX. Benjamin Stani, director of business development at Matrixport, remarked that GBTC flows seem to have stabilized, with many forced sellers potentially exhausted. However, Stani cautioned that outflows could potentially surge again, considering the volatility observed in weekly flows of ETFs since their approval. He stressed the importance of exercising caution when interpreting this data point, noting past periods of slowdown. BlackRock’s IBIT fund reached $18.2 billion in assets under management (AUM) on Tuesday, trailing slightly behind Grayscale’s $23.2 billion. As BlackRock’s popularity surged, it gradually closed the gap between the two. Just two months prior, Grayscale’s fund boasted approximately $23.4 billion in AUM, while BlackRock’s stood at $4.4 billion. Grayscale’s ETF, initially launched with nearly $30 billion in AUM, has seen a declining trend in AUM, partially attributed to Genesis selling GBTC shares, according to Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg. In terms of trading volume, Grayscale’s fund has been relinquishing market share, dropping from around 50% at the inception of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 11 to 23.5% on Tuesday. Nope.

The US economic calendar is packed with crucial events, including key inflation data and the release of minutes from the March Federal Reserve meeting. Market participants are particularly focused on the upcoming Core Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures, as they serve as a leading indicator of inflation. Moreover, the start of the Q1 2024 earnings season on Friday, featuring reports from leading banks, adds to the anticipation surrounding market movements. Furthermore, the minutes of the March Fed FOMC meeting on Wednesday, along with scheduled speeches by central bank officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, will provide additional insights into inflation dynamics. Amidst an official inflation rate of 3.2%, with forecasts suggesting a rise to 3.4% for March, potential market volatility looms large. Crypto Market Assessment: Over the weekend, crypto markets remained relatively stable, with total capitalization standing at $2.71 trillion in Asia on Monday morning. Bitcoin experienced a brief surge surpassing $70,000 on Sunday then retraced to $69,500, maintaining tight trading conditions over the past 24 hours, but today, during Europe morning hours the price surged to $72.700 making a 4% gain according to tradingview.com.  Ethereum witnessed a 5% increase to $3,620 at the time of reporting, while altcoins starting to show strength while the bitcoin price slightly pulls back to $72.400 at the time of writing. In summary, the trajectory of crypto markets in the coming days may hinge significantly on the outcome of key economic reports from the United States, but the bullish start of the week is a good sign for the bulls showing the market strength with a potential big move to new highs.

Genesis, a prominent crypto-lending firm, has been grappling with financial difficulties and the specter of bankruptcy for over a year. In a bid to address these challenges, Genesis has opted to sell off its holdings in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and acquire more Bitcoin (BTC), likely in an effort to bolster its financial position. The recent move by Genesis to sell approximately 36 million GBTC shares to acquire BTC, as reported by Bloomberg, appears to be motivated by a desire to take advantage of Bitcoin’s recent price surge and to raise funds to settle outstanding debts. This significant shift has caused notable fluctuations in the price of GBTC, closely tied to the movements of Bitcoin. The decision by Genesis has not gone unnoticed in the crypto community. Notably, @CryptoPatel highlighted Genesis’s move in a recent social media post, emphasizing the conversion of GBTC shares into a substantial amount of BTC.

Whales in the market are reportedly accumulating BTC, signaling a bullish sentiment amidst supply dynamics. In light of recent optimism surrounding Bitcoin, QCP Capital, a respected crypto-analysis firm, has noted a rise in BTC spot ETF inflows, along with significant Bitcoin call buying. This, coupled with reduced leverage and a cautious trader approach, suggests a stabilizing market environment. Despite these positive indicators, Anthony Scaramucci remains cautiously optimistic about Bitcoin’s prospects post-halving. He predicts a potential surge of six to ten times in Bitcoin’s price, citing the event’s underpriced impact.

2024-04-05 10:09:37+00:00,Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Long-Term Holders Continue Accumulating,https://dailycoinpost.com/bitcoin-bullish-signal-long-term-holders-continue-accumulating/,"Recent on-chain data for Bitcoin indicates significant activity among “accumulation addresses,” which continue to acquire substantial amounts of the cryptocurrency. Analyst Ali highlights in a recent post on X that Bitcoin accumulation addresses have been experiencing notable inflows lately. These addresses typically belong to long-term holders of the cryptocurrency. There are specific criteria for an address to be categorized as an accumulation address. Notably, such addresses should not have recorded any outgoing transfers. This indicates that accumulation addresses have only received incoming transfers, never engaging in selling transactions. Additionally, an address qualifies as an accumulation address once it has received at least two inflow transactions and holds more than 10 BTC in its balance. It’s important to note that exchange and miner-associated wallets are not included in this category, as their holdings typically represent the sell-side of the market. The supply held by accumulation addresses is considered to be firmly in the hands of long-term holders, reducing the available supply when these investors make further purchases. Furthermore, addresses that have not received any inflows for more than seven years are excluded from this group, as they are often presumed lost or inactive. 21,400 $BTC, worth around $1.40 billion, were moved to accumulation addresses! pic.twitter.com/oYhMj481g8 — Ali (@ali_charts) April 4, 2024  Ali shared a CryptoQuant chart depicting the trend of Bitcoin inflows into accumulation addresses since the beginning of the year. The chart illustrates significant inflows to these addresses throughout the month, indicating continuous buying activity by these investors. The metric peaked at 21,400 BTC on the first day of the month, equivalent to over $1.4 billion at the current exchange rate. This amount is noteworthy and approaches the all-time high of 25,300 BTC achieved just a month and a half ago. The ongoing buying activity among accumulation addresses is viewed as a positive signal for Bitcoin. Correspondingly, Bitcoin’s price has shown signs of stability and recovery, with a recent increase of over 3%, pushing it above the $68,100 level.  In summary, the sustained accumulation of Bitcoin by long-term holders suggests confidence in the cryptocurrency’s future prospects and may contribute to its price resilience in the market.

Analysis indicates that a substantial portion, equivalent to 1.87 million Bitcoin, was acquired at levels surpassing the $60,000 threshold. This data, presented in Glassnode’s latest weekly report, offers a breakdown of Bitcoin supply distribution based on the price points at which investors made their purchases.  Glassnode delineates between short-term holders (STHs) and long-term holders (LTHs), representing the two primary segments of the Bitcoin market categorized by the duration of coin ownership. The division occurs at 155 days, with investors holding their coins for less than this duration classified as STHs, while those holding for longer periods fall under the LTHs category. Significantly, the chart illustrates that the majority of Bitcoin acquired above $60,000 belongs to STHs, although there are notable holdings by LTHs, reflecting investors who entered the market during the 2021 bull run. Remarkably, some investors who purchased at the peak of the 2021 bull market have demonstrated resilience by holding onto their investments, despite facing prolonged periods of market volatility. Their patience has now yielded positive results, as they approach breakeven or profitable positions amidst recent price movements. The surge in acquisitions at these high price levels can be attributed partly to Bitcoin’s recent sharp rally, which has captured considerable attention and spurred increased buying activity. Additionally, significant inflows into Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have contributed to the accumulation at these elevated prices.  Traditionally viewed as steadfast holders, LTHs have shown signs of reducing their holdings, as evidenced by a decline of 900,000 BTC since December. Glassnode highlights that a portion of this reduction, approximately 286,000 BTC, can be linked to outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). As of the current writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $66,300, marking a slight decrease of over 3% over the past week.  Bitcoin Maximalist and Toxic to our banking and monetary system.

In a strategic move signaling a progressive shift in Turkey’s regulatory landscape, Misyon has entered into a partnership with Swiss technology provider, Taurus. The aim? To delve into the realm of cryptocurrency custody and asset tokenization, potentially paving the way for broader market acceptance in Türkiye. Under the agreement, Misyon Bank will leverage Taurus’ cutting-edge technologies to securely custody digital assets, initially focusing on prominent cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, and Avalanche, with plans to include a broader spectrum of “essential cryptocurrencies” in the future. Moreover, Misyon is gearing up to establish a robust infrastructure for the tokenization of traditional securities such as bonds and stocks, catering not only to Turkish enterprises but also to those across the wider region. Önder Halisdemir, CEO of what he dubs “Turkey’s premier neobank,” envisions transforming Turkey into a regional financial hub akin to Switzerland. The collaboration with Taurus marks a pivotal stride towards this ambition, as Halisdemir emphasizes, “With this partnership, Turkish assets will be presented attractively to global investors,” positioning Turkey at the forefront of the tokenization trend. In Turkey, the regulatory groundwork for digital asset custody is gradually taking shape. Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek’s favorable disposition towards the industry, coupled with President Erdoğan’s apparent inclination towards crypto-friendly policies, underscores a potentially conducive environment for innovation. Misyon’s bold move to embrace Bitcoin and Ether custody hints at a more permissive stance from the government, a departure from its previously stringent approach. However, by aligning with Taurus, Misyon Bank adopts a prudent strategy, ensuring adaptability in the face of evolving regulations, even in scenarios where certain cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may face restrictions, and only regulated “digital assets” are permitted. Geneva-headquartered Taurus stands out for seamlessly integrating blockchain with traditional banking, offering a crypto platform that harmonizes with conventional banking systems. This interoperability has garnered Taurus a clientele comprising major financial institutions such as Banco Santander, Deutsche Bank, and Credit Suisse. Its platform’s ability to interface with both public and private blockchains facilitates transactions involving digital central bank currencies. With a substantial $65 million investment secured in February of the preceding year, Taurus is well-positioned to advance its technology and expand its client base, prioritizing innovation over immediate profitability. While Taurus may not epitomize the ethos of pure cryptocurrencies, its model offers a considerably more inclusive alternative compared to entities like R3, which lean towards digitalized fiat currencies and bonds, aligning closely with Europe’s banking establishment.

2024-03-29 10:42:56+00:00,Bitcoin’s Market Cycles: The Influence of Federal Reserve Rate Cuts,https://dailycoinpost.com/bitcoins-market-cycles-the-influence-of-federal-reserve-rate-cuts/,"The fluctuations in Bitcoin’s market have long been observed to follow cyclical patterns, often tied to halving events. However, one analyst proposes that this year, the actions of the US central bank might hold even more sway over Bitcoin’s trajectory. Benjamin Cowen, CEO of Into The Cryptoverse, recently speculated on whether the current Bitcoin market cycle is unfolding as expected or if it’s exhibiting what he terms a “left-translated” pattern, where the peak occurs earlier than usual. Despite being weeks away from the halving event, Bitcoin has already achieved a new all-time high. This has raised the prospect of the cycle peaking much sooner than in previous instances, typically occurring in the year following a halving event. Cowen suggests that the reaction of Bitcoin markets to any Federal Reserve rate adjustments could be pivotal in determining its trajectory. A pullback following rate cuts might align it with past cycles, possibly leading to a peak in 2025. Conversely, a lack of significant correction or consolidation could indicate a left-translated peak. I think the answer to whether this #BTC market cycle is a normal one or left-translated will depend on how the market reacts to rate cuts in a few months. Thread 👇 — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) March 28, 2024 
The recent meeting of the Fed on March 20 maintained rates at 5.5%, sparking immediate volatility. While the next policy meeting is scheduled for May, market expectations lean heavily towards no change, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Drawing parallels between the price movements in 2013 and 2021, with peaks in April followed by another peak in November, Cowen suggests that a similar pattern this cycle could signal a left-translated cycle. He indicates that if Bitcoin experiences a correction post-rate cuts extending into Q4, without a new mania phase, a standard cycle peak in the post-halving year could be anticipated. Comparing returns from the current cycle to post-halving years, Cowen suggests that if the peak occurs a year earlier, returns in 2023 might resemble those of post-halving years. Ultimately, Cowen asserts that Bitcoin’s reaction to rate cuts later this year will be critical in determining the trajectory of this bull market cycle. Glassnode, an on-chain analytics platform, also drew comparisons to previous market cycles. By both duration and distance from the April 2021 peak, the market is in a similar position to December 2020, relative to the 2018-21 cycle. If we index the #Bitcoin price performance (black) since the April 2021 ATH (where we argue bear market sentiment set in), we can see a remarkable similarity to the prior cycle (blue).

2024-03-25 10:55:06+00:00,"CryptoQuant: Bitcoin’s 15% Dip Driven by Profit-Taking, but Bullish Momentum Persists",https://dailycoinpost.com/cryptoquant-bitcoins-15-dip-driven-by-profit-taking-but-bullish-momentum-persists/,"Bitcoin’s recent dip, marking a 15% correction from its peak at $73,700, has stirred discussions about the state of the ongoing bull cycle. Observers attribute this correction to profit-taking activities by miners, whales, and major investors, who seized the opportunity to capitalize on the surge in Bitcoin’s value. Despite this correction, analysts at CryptoQuant remain optimistic about the longevity of the Bitcoin bull run. They point out that key valuation metrics suggest that Bitcoin has not yet reached the top of its current cycle. BTC Correction Dynamics The Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator signaled an overheated bull market last week, coinciding with BTC’s drop from its peak to $60,700. This downward movement was primarily driven by traders selling off their holdings to secure substantial profits. According to CryptoQuant’s findings, unrealized profit margins surged to 69%, the highest level since March 2021 when Bitcoin was trading at around $60,000. Although there has been significant selling pressure, the unrealized profit margins remain elevated at 47%. Analysts noted that short-term Bitcoin holders, including traders, recorded the highest profit margins since May 2019, indicating a trend of profit-taking among this group following Bitcoin’s recent all-time high. Moreover, significant BTC holders, possibly including miners, liquidated a substantial amount of their holdings as prices soared above $70,000. Approximately 567,000 BTC were moved when Bitcoin reached its peak on March 12, representing 35% of total transfers on the network. Bull Cycle Endurance Despite the recent correction, CryptoQuant’s analysis suggests that the Bitcoin bull cycle is far from over. Demand for BTC in the United States has eased, as indicated by the negative Coinbase Premium observed shortly after BTC surpassed $73,000. Should the correction persist, analysts anticipate Bitcoin’s price could retreat to the $58,000-$60,000 range, which corresponds to the cost basis of large short-term holders. However, from a broader perspective, the current bull cycle appears to have more room to grow. Only 48% of Bitcoin investments come from short-term holders, whereas historical data indicates that bull cycles typically conclude with 84%-92% of investments from this group. Furthermore, valuation metrics have not yet reached levels consistent with past market tops. The CryptoQuant P&L Index remains outside the market top zone, indicating a continuation of the bull cycle. In conclusion, while Bitcoin may be experiencing a temporary correction fueled by profit-taking, the underlying metrics suggest that the bull cycle is still in motion, with potential for further upward movement.

The mounting economic instability in Argentina has prompted citizens to increasingly turn to Bitcoin, as recent data reveals a substantial uptick in the acquisition of the digital currency. This trend coincides with Bitcoin’s remarkable ascent in recent months, surpassing historic highs and outpacing traditional inflation hedges like the U.S. dollar. Reported by Bloomberg, the first week of March witnessed a staggering 34,700 Bitcoin purchases in Argentina, marking the highest volume in the country over the past 20 months. This surge represents more than double the figures observed in early February, showcasing a burgeoning interest in and adoption of Bitcoin among Argentinians. The appeal of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation has grown significantly, especially as the cryptocurrency has experienced substantial gains, soaring by as much as 73% year-to-date and reaching unprecedented highs of over $73,000. Various factors contribute to this surge, including the launch of the U.S.’ first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and anticipation surrounding the impending halving event slated for April. With Argentina’s inflation rate at an alarming 276%, the value of the national currency, the peso, has been steadily eroding, prompting citizens to explore alternative stores of value. While the U.S. dollar has traditionally been the preferred option for stability amidst economic uncertainty, recent peso strengthening efforts by the government have somewhat diminished its appeal. President Javier Milei’s administration has undertaken measures to tackle economic challenges, including initiatives to stabilize the central bank’s balance sheet. Despite campaigning on a platform promising to dollarize Argentina’s economy, Milei’s focus since assuming office has primarily been on managing the peso’s valuation rather than immediate dollarization. He has also hinted that complete dollarization remains a distant prospect. The shift towards Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic instability has coincided with a decrease in demand for traditional assets, including digital tokens tethered to real-world currencies such as USDT and USDC. Argentina’s history of economic volatility, characterized by frequent currency devaluations, presents significant hurdles for its residents in terms of saving and financial management. This backdrop has fueled heightened interest in cryptocurrency within the country, driven by a desire to shield against the adverse effects of peso devaluation, rampant inflation, and restrictions on accessing foreign currencies.

2024-03-19 16:09:36+00:00,Quant Analyst Identifies Potential End to Bitcoin’s Bullish Phase,https://dailycoinpost.com/quant-analyst-identifies-potential-end-to-bitcoins-bullish-phase/,"A quantitative analyst has spotted a notable signal within a key Bitcoin on-chain metric that could signify the nearing conclusion of the current bullish phase for the leading cryptocurrency. The metric under scrutiny is the “Net Unrealized Profit/Loss” (NUPL) indicator, which serves as a gauge for the collective unrealized profit or loss held by Bitcoin investors. By meticulously analyzing the historical on-chain data of each Bitcoin transaction, this metric computes the difference between the current price and the price at which each Bitcoin was last transferred.  When this disparity leans towards the positive, it indicates that investors are currently holding positions in profit. Conversely, negative values suggest a prevalence of underwater positions within the market. Over the past few weeks, the Bitcoin NUPL has surged to elevated levels, reflecting the substantial gains the cryptocurrency has experienced during this period. Notably, the indicator has breached the 0.6 level, a threshold historically associated with infrequent sustainability. Instances of surpassing this level have often coincided with market peaks, as illustrated by the chart depicting the trend of Bitcoin NUPL over recent years. Exceptions to this trend occurred during the notable bull runs of 2017 and the first half of 2021, where the indicator persisted in its ascent beyond the established threshold. However, such occurrences were rare, and sustained periods above this level typically preceded significant corrections in Bitcoin’s price. Drawing insights from historical data, the analyst points out that previous corrections materialized approximately three to six weeks after entering the “overbought” zone, suggesting the potential for a similar correction in the near future. The inclination towards profit-taking tends to increase as investors witness their gains escalate, often prompting sell-offs when NUPL values are high. Given these observations, it’s conceivable that Bitcoin may be on the cusp of a notable correction, or one may already be underway, given the recent downtrend in prices. At the time of composing this analysis, Bitcoin is exchanging hands at approximately $63,000, indicating a 12% decrease over the course of the past week. While the cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile and subject to sudden shifts in sentiment, the NUPL indicator provides valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of investor behavior. As Bitcoin continues to assert its position as a mainstream asset class, understanding these on-chain metrics becomes increasingly vital for investors and analysts alike. In conclusion, the Bitcoin NUPL’s recent surge to elevated levels suggests a potential inflection point in the current bullish phase. Investors and analysts are advised to closely monitor market dynamics and remain vigilant amidst the possibility of a significant correction in the near future.

2024-03-19 12:51:07+00:00,Explaining the Power Law Model in Bitcoin Price Prediction,https://dailycoinpost.com/explaining-the-power-law-model-in-bitcoin-price-prediction/,"In the realm of Bitcoin price prediction, the “Power Law” model emerges as a compelling candidate, garnering significant attention for its potential to accurately reflect the trajectory of Bitcoin’s value. But does this universal law truly apply to Bitcoin, and what implications does it hold for the future of this digital currency? Could we witness seven-figure Bitcoin valuations in the 2030s? Delving into the intricacies of this model unveils a fascinating perspective on the dynamics of Bitcoin pricing and its future trajectory. At its core, the Power Law model encapsulates a class of formulas that intricately describe curves, employing three fundamental parameters: a, x, and b. These formulas, represented as a * x^b, elucidate how a particular value, y, changes in relation to the variable, x, raised to the power of b. This universal law finds manifestation across diverse domains, from geometric principles governing land area expansion to the gravitational pull in physics, and even societal phenomena such as population growth and economic disparities. Essentially, the Power Law emerges as a fundamental framework governing iterative processes and self-reinforcing systems, permeating through the fabric of nature and human interactions. In the realm of Bitcoin, understanding the intricacies of the Power Law entails unraveling the feedback loop between price dynamics, miners, and users. A model devised by Giovanni Santostasi delineates this intricate interplay, portraying Bitcoin’s evolution as a cascade of interactions amplifying its value proposition. As more users adopt Bitcoin, its value surges, driving increased mining activities and augmenting network security. This symbiotic relationship forms the cornerstone of Santostasi’s model, where the growth of users is endowed with exponential power, shaping the trajectory of Bitcoin adoption: Based on this framework, Santostasi and collaborators devised a series of curves culminating in a primary equation: P = $38,788 * (B/15)^5.41 This equation delineates Bitcoin’s price growth, intricately tied to block time fluctuations, with remarkable accuracy spanning over 13 years. The concept of a “fair price” emerges as a focal point in Santostasi’s analysis, providing insights into Bitcoin’s valuation vis-a-vis the Power Law model. According to this paradigm, the “fair price” stands at $62,835, indicating a slight overvaluation of Bitcoin at present. However, the model’s efficacy lies in its ability to capture Bitcoin’s fluctuating dynamics, punctuated by periods of bubbles and corrections. While the Power Law offers a robust framework for understanding Bitcoin’s price evolution, its applicability hinges on interpreting fluctuations within the broader context of market dynamics.  Peering into the future through the lens of the Power Law unveils a spectrum of potential trajectories for Bitcoin’s price. By extrapolating future scenarios, analysts speculate on the evolution of Bitcoin’s valuation over time: While these projections paint a tantalizing picture of Bitcoin’s future trajectory, it’s imperative to acknowledge the inherent limitations of any predictive model. The journey towards widespread adoption and market maturity unfolds amidst a complex interplay of technological advancements, regulatory developments, and investor sentiment, introducing variables that defy deterministic forecasting. Unraveling the Enigma: The Quest for Sustainable Growth As Bitcoin’s price trajectory unfolds, the concept of the S-curve emerges as a poignant reminder of the inherent ebb and flow in technological adoption. While the Power Law illuminates Bitcoin’s exponential growth phase, characterized by a factor of 3, it also foreshadows an eventual transition towards a more linear growth trajectory. Analogous to the diffusion of innovations, Bitcoin’s evolution may mirror the typical lifecycle of transformative technologies, marked by phases of rapid expansion followed by stabilization. In navigating the enigmatic terrain of Bitcoin price prediction, embracing uncertainty emerges as a prudent approach. While the Power Law offers invaluable insights into Bitcoin’s evolutionary dynamics, its predictive efficacy wanes amidst the myriad complexities shaping the digital currency landscape. As Bitcoin continues to chart its course amidst a sea of volatility and innovation, the journey towards sustainable growth and widespread adoption unfolds as a testament to the resilience of decentralized finance. In essence, while the Power Law offers a compelling framework for understanding Bitcoin’s price dynamics, its true potential lies in fostering a nuanced discourse around the future trajectory of this transformative technology. As we embark on this journey of exploration and discovery, let us embrace the uncertainty inherent in Bitcoin’s evolution, navigating the intricate interplay of market forces and technological innovation with steadfast resolve and unwavering curiosity.

This week marks a pivotal moment on the US economic front, with the Federal Reserve scheduled to announce its interest rate decision on March 20, setting the trajectory for the nation’s economic path ahead. Amidst this economic buzz, data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange suggests a high probability, around 99%, of the Fed maintaining current interest rates. Market expectations have shifted, with forecasts now projecting only three interest rate cuts in 2024, a significant reduction from previous estimates. Initially, markets speculated as many as seven rate cuts for the year, but with inflation data showing signs of resurgence, optimism for multiple cuts has tempered. The current interest rate in the US stands at 5.5%, a status maintained since July 2023 amid inflationary pressures. Beyond the US, countries including Australia, the United Kingdom, and Japan are also slated to reveal their interest rate decisions this week, promising a week of potential market volatility. In the realm of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, recent institutional interest fueled by spot ETF launches in the US has provided support. However, with daily ETF inflows tapering off and the halving event drawing nearer, this enthusiasm may be diminishing. Crypto analyst ‘Rekt Capital’ recently warned of Bitcoin entering a precarious “Danger Zone” this week, historically associated with retracements before halving events. These retracements, observed between two and four weeks prior to previous halvings, have seen significant declines. In 2020, Bitcoin experienced a retracement of -20%, while in 2016, it saw a retracement of -40%. #BTC In 3 days, Bitcoin will officially enter the “Danger Zone” (orange) where historical Pre-Halving Retraces have begun Historically, Bitcoin has performed Pre-Halving Retraces 14-28 days before the Halving In 2020, this retrace was -20% deep In 2016, this retrace was -40%… pic.twitter.com/t0EHA6bpWY — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) March 16, 2024  Already, Bitcoin has retreated 7.7% from its March 14 all-time high of $73,738, currently trading at $68,100 at the time of writing.

El Salvador, known for its pioneering move of adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, has remained steadfast in its HODL (Hold On for Dear Life) strategy, despite the market turbulence witnessed two years ago and the recent surge pushing towards new all-time highs. The nation commenced its Bitcoin acquisitions back in September 2021, when Bitcoin was valued at $51,769. President Nayib Bukele’s Bitcoin investment approach came under scrutiny when the value plummeted from $69,000 in November 2021 to $16,000 a year later. However, the investment regained profitability when Bitcoin surpassed the average purchase price of $42,600 in February. According to reports from its Bitcoin tracker, El Salvador holds 2,864 BTC, currently valued at $188 million, procured through 12 transactions at an average price of $42,630 each. With Bitcoin witnessing a 176% increase in value over the past year, El Salvador’s unrealized gains have soared to $66 million, resulting in a 54% profit from the initial investment. While these figures are based on publicly available data, they do not encompass all of the country’s Bitcoin holdings. In a recent announcement on X, President Nayib Bukele mentioned additional Bitcoin acquisitions through various revenue streams. These include proceeds from a unique citizenship passport scheme involving the conversion of Bitcoin into U.S. dollars to support local enterprises, earnings from Bitcoin mining operations, and revenue generated from government-provided services. Furthermore, in December, El Salvador introduced its “Freedom VISA” program, offering residency to up to 1,000 individuals annually who invest a minimum of $1 million in Bitcoin or Tether (USDT) stablecoins. President Bukele disclosed this week that the nation has established its inaugural Bitcoin “piggy bank,” securely stored within a vault on national territory. He shared an image revealing a wallet containing 5,689.68 BTC, valued at $406 million.

An initial transfer of 1,120 BTC, valued at $76.5 million, was conducted on March 13, requiring authorization from a 3/5 multi-signature setup, with approval from four signatories, as reported by Mempool. The largest transaction involved the transfer of 4,000 BTC, equivalent to $273 million, on March 14, approximately two hours after President Bukele’s announcement. For the first time, President Bukele has associated the country’s Bitcoin assets with a specific wallet address, a departure from his usual method of providing updates on the national Bitcoin stockpile via social media platforms.

Over the past 24 hours, the broader altcoin market has also turned bearish, leading to the liquidation of nearly 200,000 traders. Bitcoin’s recent surge propelled the asset from $61,000 to over $73,000 within a span of ten days. Just yesterday, Bitcoin nearly touched $74,000, marking a new milestone for the primary cryptocurrency. Altcoins followed suit, with several reaching multi-year highs. Ethereum surpassed $4,000, SOL peaked at $180, and BNB surged past $600. However, such rapid rallies often precede sharp retracements, as some investors choose to capitalize on profits.

This milestone not only signifies a remarkable 60% surge since the beginning of the year but also propels Bitcoin’s total market capitalization beyond $1.4 trillion, solidifying its position as the 8th largest financial asset globally. Rewind to March 11, 2023, and the narrative surrounding Bitcoin was vastly different. Priced at a modest $20,000 following a setback from the $30,000 mark, skeptics were quick to dismiss its role as a hedge against inflation or a reliable financial instrument in times of uncertainty. Yet, Bitcoin defied expectations, swiftly regaining momentum in the ensuing months.  June of the same year brought a pivotal moment with BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, announcing its intentions to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This announcement proved to be a game-changer, injecting renewed optimism into the market. Fast forward to January 2024, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved nearly a dozen Bitcoin ETFs, fueling unprecedented demand and driving Bitcoin’s price to new heights. Last week marked another historic milestone as Bitcoin shattered its 2021 all-time high just ahead of a scheduled halving, a momentous occasion that set the stage for further price appreciation. Today, Bitcoin’s ascent to nearly $72,000 underscores its unwavering momentum and solidifies its status as a formidable financial asset. As Bitcoin’s market capitalization eclipses $1.4 trillion, it now surpasses established giants such as Meta (formerly Facebook) and silver, the world’s second-largest commodity. However, the question remains: who’s next? With formidable contenders like Alphabet and Amazon looming on the horizon, Bitcoin faces an uphill battle to surpass these corporate behemoths. To overtake Google’s parent company, Bitcoin’s price would need to exceed $85,000, representing a 20% increase. Similarly, surpassing Jeff Bezos’ corporate empire would require Bitcoin to surge past $94,000, marking a 30% increase from its current levels. Yet, the ultimate prize remains gold, the quintessential store of value and a benchmark for financial stability. Surpassing gold would necessitate a monumental leap, with Bitcoin’s price soaring to an unprecedented $700,000. While such figures may seem ambitious, Bitcoin’s track record speaks volumes, having surged more than 60% since the start of 2024 and 40% in the past two weeks alone. As Bitcoin continues to redefine the financial landscape, its ascent underscores the transformative potential of decentralized digital assets. While challenges lie ahead, the journey towards widespread adoption and mainstream recognition is well underway, with Bitcoin leading the charge towards a more inclusive and resilient financial ecosystem.

Here’s the pitch that convinced them to buy: pic.twitter.com/nE7PuNF7Nw — Kole Lee (@kolelee_) March 4, 2024 
Originating in 1978 through the generosity of an anonymous donor in tribute to the renowned banker Charles Blyth, the fund oversees a substantial portion of Stanford University’s endowment. Its investment strategies span various assets, including stocks and bonds, aiming to support education by empowering students to invest while contributing 25% of returns to the university’s financial aid. Lee’s presentation in February emphasized crypto market cycles, the influx of funds into exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the potential of Bitcoin as a hedge against financial instability and conflict. Advocating for investment in the iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) issued by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, Lee’s proposal resulted in the purchase of BTC and the decision to allocate 7% of the portfolio to the leading digital asset. Notably, IBIT stands out as the most substantial and high-performing product among the ten spot Bitcoin ETFs, boasting over $11 billion in assets under management and a daily inflow of $420 million as of March 4. The Blyth Fund’s move into BTC signifies the increasing adoption of this relatively new digital asset. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States has propelled Bitcoin adoption to unprecedented heights, attracting billions of dollars from traditional financial sectors. Heightened ETF activity has also driven BTC prices to levels reminiscent of the previous bull cycle in November 2021. Bitcoin surpassed the $68,000 mark on a recent Tuesday before experiencing a significant correction. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at around $66,700, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, March 5 saw record-breaking trading volumes for the ten ETFs, reaching approximately $10 billion, with IBIT alone accounting for a significant portion of this activity.

2024-03-10 11:40:28+00:00,BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Champions Bitcoin as Modern-Day Digital Gold,https://dailycoinpost.com/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-champions-bitcoin-as-modern-day-digital-gold/,"In a recent interview on Fox Business, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, made a compelling case for Bitcoin as the digital equivalent of gold, emphasizing its capacity to shield investors against inflation and mitigate risks associated with government involvement. The narrative is changing. 
Fink’s endorsement of Bitcoin as a store of value echoes sentiments shared by many in the cryptocurrency community. He highlighted its potential to serve as a hedge against inflation, a concern that has been amplified by recent global economic uncertainties. During the interview, Fink emphasized the importance of Bitcoin’s ability to transcend national borders and operate independently of government control. This characteristic, he argued, reduces counterparty risk and provides individuals with a level of financial autonomy previously unattainable through traditional investment avenues. Drawing parallels between Bitcoin and gold, Fink pointed out that while the latter has practical uses in jewelry and electronics, Bitcoin’s value lies in its role as a tradable asset. He likened Bitcoin to digital gold, suggesting that both assets have the potential to retain value over time and serve as a reliable investment option. Fink’s remarks on Bitcoin underscore a growing recognition of the cryptocurrency’s legitimacy within mainstream finance. As the CEO of one of the world’s largest asset management firms, his endorsement carries significant weight and may influence investor sentiment towards Bitcoin. Despite ongoing debates about the future trajectory of Bitcoin and its place in the global financial ecosystem, Fink’s endorsement adds credibility to the narrative that Bitcoin is a viable alternative to traditional assets. Its decentralized nature, coupled with its ability to transcend geopolitical boundaries, positions Bitcoin as a promising store of value in an increasingly interconnected world. As Bitcoin continues to gain traction among institutional investors and financial leaders, Fink’s remarks serve as a reminder of the cryptocurrency’s potential to reshape the landscape of global finance. Whether Bitcoin will ultimately fulfill its promise as the digital gold of the future remains to be seen, but Fink’s endorsement signals a significant step towards broader acceptance within mainstream financial circles.

2024-03-10 11:11:53+00:00,Is the Bitcoin Rally Losing Steam in the Near Term? Altcoin Season Emerges (Analysis),https://dailycoinpost.com/is-the-bitcoin-rally-losing-steam-in-the-near-term-altcoin-season-emerges-analysis/,"Bitcoin soared to a fresh all-time high this week, but faced a swift rejection, hinting at potential exhaustion among traders. According to on-chain analytics provider Santiment, despite Bitcoin’s remarkable milestone, there’s a palpable sense of fatigue and diversion towards alternative coins within the trading community. On March 8, BTC briefly surged above $70,000 on Coinbase, establishing a new peak. However, it swiftly retracted from this pinnacle for the second time in a week, settling around $68,000 shortly after. The recent surge in crypto markets has largely been driven by institutional investors, evidenced by consecutive days of high trading volumes and inflows into newly launched spot Bitcoin ETFs. Santiment’s data also reveals that social activity, measured by the percentage of discussions focused on BTC versus other assets, stands at a healthy 27.5%. Nonetheless, it doesn’t reflect the exuberance witnessed when BTC surpassed $60,000 less than two weeks ago. 🥳 #Bitcoin has established yet another new #AllTimeHigh today, reaching a market value as high as $70,199 on #Coinbase. Despite the incredible milestone for #cryptocurrency, there is a combined sense of exhaustion and #altcoin distraction coming from the trading community right… pic.twitter.com/S4YqYkiOJ6 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 8, 2024  Moreover, previously inactive coins are resuming circulation at a rapid pace, a common phenomenon observed in most bull markets. Santiment suggests that until we see widespread euphoria and stagnant coin movement on the Bitcoin network, there’s potential for market capitalization to continue ascending. Crypto investor Scott Melker remains optimistic, expressing to his substantial following on March 8 that he anticipates the onset of a significant bull run for both Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. “I believe we’re witnessing the early stages of a major surge, where even coins lacking fundamental value may experience astronomical gains before an inevitable correction.” As of the time of writing, the crypto market capitalization stands at $2.72 trillion, its highest level since December 2021 and just 12% below its peak. In a related development, JPMorgan analysts have projected the potential size of the bitcoin ETF market to reach approximately $62 billion. While net inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs currently total around $9.2 billion, some capital may have been redirected from similar products like Grayscale’s GBTC, which has been experiencing daily outflows since its conversion. According to the bank’s analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, this target represents a realistic estimate for the eventual size of spot bitcoin ETFs, possibly within a timeframe of two to three years.

2024-03-08 22:37:45+00:00,JP Morgan report says Bitcoin ETF inflows could break $60 BILLION in 3 years,https://dailycoinpost.com/jp-morgan-report-says-bitcoin-etf-inflows-could-break-60-billion-in-3-years/,"Amidst the fervor surrounding the meteoric rise of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, discussions regarding its place in investment portfolios have been abundant. Recently, JPMorgan analysts have weighed in on this debate, offering insights that may temper some of the more optimistic projections. The crux of the matter lies in the comparison between Bitcoin and gold, both often touted as alternative stores of value. Some proponents of Bitcoin argue that it should eventually match gold in terms of its presence within investment portfolios. However, JPMorgan analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, challenge this notion, highlighting the crucial factor of risk that is often overlooked. In a recent report, the analysts assert that while there have been substantial inflows into newly-launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., expecting Bitcoin to match the notional amounts of gold within investors’ portfolios may be unrealistic. They emphasize that investors typically consider risk and volatility when allocating across asset classes. Given that Bitcoin exhibits approximately 3.7 times higher volatility than gold, the analysts argue that expecting Bitcoin to match gold in notional amounts within portfolios is likely impractical. To illustrate this point, the analysts propose a scenario where Bitcoin matches gold in terms of risk capital, resulting in an implied allocation that is significantly lower than the current levels. Based on their calculations, they suggest a potential Bitcoin price of $45,000, considerably lower than its current level of $66,000. This implies that the implied allocation to Bitcoin within investors’ portfolios has already surpassed that of gold in volatility-adjusted terms. Despite these reservations, the analysts also acknowledge the significant inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, projecting around $62 billion worth of inflows within the next 2-3 years. They base this projection on the premise that if gold is used as a benchmark and the same volatility ratio is applied, it suggests a potential size for Bitcoin ETFs. This, they argue, represents a realistic target for the potential size of spot Bitcoin ETFs over time. However, it’s crucial to note that much of this projected net inflow could result from a continued rotational shift from existing instruments to ETFs. In fact, spot Bitcoin ETFs outside of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust have already witnessed a cumulative inflow of $19 billion since their launch, nearing half of the projected rotational shift anticipated by JPMorgan throughout 2024. Yet, there remains skepticism regarding whether the entirety of this inflow represents new money entering the cryptocurrency space. The analysts suspect that a considerable portion of these funds may come from retail investors shifting from existing instruments and venues to new spot Bitcoin ETFs. In conclusion, while the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the potential influx of funds into the cryptocurrency market are significant developments, it’s essential to approach these projections with a level of caution. JPMorgan’s analysis underscores the importance of considering risk and volatility when evaluating the role of Bitcoin within investment portfolios, suggesting that expectations for Bitcoin to match gold in notional amounts may be overly optimistic.

2024-03-08 10:35:50+00:00,Bitcoin’s Black Swan: The Return of Satoshi and the $75 Billion Irony from Fortune.com,https://dailycoinpost.com/bitcoins-black-swan-the-return-of-satoshi-and-the-75-billion-irony-from-fortune-com/,"Bitcoin’s meteoric rise to fame, once again, captures the headlines as it breaks its all-time high, propelled by new ETFs backed by financial giants like BlackRock. This resurgence has painted a picture of Bitcoin as a mainstream investment vehicle, basking in the glow of newfound legitimacy. However, amidst the celebratory atmosphere, according to Fortune.com, a dark shadow looms—one that could potentially unleash chaos upon the crypto market: the return of Satoshi Nakamoto. The enigmatic figure behind Bitcoin’s inception, Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity remains shrouded in mystery, adding to the intrigue of the cryptocurrency world. Satoshi’s disappearance from the scene left behind a sizable fortune estimated at a staggering $75 billion in Bitcoin, a treasure trove that has become the subject of speculation and apprehension alike. Recent events, including a mysterious $1.2 million deposit into one of Satoshi’s wallets, have reignited fears of Satoshi’s potential comeback. While some view it as a tribute marking Bitcoin’s anniversary, others fear it may be a governmental ploy to lure Satoshi out of hiding, prompting speculations about tax entanglements and legal complications. But let’s entertain the absurdity of Satoshi’s return for a moment—a return likened to “an asteroid hitting the earth,” as aptly put by Bitcoin historian Pete Rizzo. Satoshi’s reemergence would not only defy ideological principles but also attract a swarm of unwanted attention, from criminals to tax inspectors, disrupting the delicate balance of the crypto world. The ongoing spectacle surrounding the trial of Craig Wright, a self-proclaimed Bitcoin inventor, adds another layer of irony to the saga. Despite Wright’s theatrical claims, evidence points elsewhere, hinting at figures like Nick Szabo and Hal Finney. The debate surrounding Satoshi’s true identity resembles a crypto-themed soap opera, complete with twists, turns, and improbable plotlines. The notion of Satoshi exercising control over Bitcoin’s core code upon their return is dismissed as a far-fetched scenario, given the decentralized nature of the currency’s maintenance. After all, if Satoshi harbored objections, they would have voiced them already—an argument that conveniently overlooks the allure of dramatic entrances and grand reveals. Yet, amidst the speculation and intrigue, one cannot overlook the ultimate irony—the fate of Satoshi’s fortune upon their demise. Seth Ginns, of CoinFund, speculates on the possibility of Satoshi quietly dispersing their wealth to loved ones, while contemplating the cataclysmic scenario of a mass sell-off—an event that could send shockwaves through the market. The concept of a “dead man’s switch” adds a macabre twist to the narrative, envisioning a scenario where Satoshi’s passing triggers a cascade of events, including the burning of wallet keys—an act that would send ripples of euphoria through the crypto community, signaling the end of an era. In the end, the saga of Satoshi Nakamoto serves as a cautionary tale—a reminder of the inherent risks and uncertainties that accompany the world of cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin’s ascent to mainstream acceptance is undoubtedly remarkable, its foundation remains built on a delicate balance of speculation, innovation, and irony. As investors navigate the treacherous waters of the crypto market, they must confront the possibility of Satoshi’s return—a specter that embodies both the allure and the peril of the digital frontier. In this unpredictable landscape, where fortunes rise and fall at the whim of anonymous creators, one thing remains certain: the only constant in the world of Bitcoin is irony itself.

2024-03-08 08:34:41+00:00,Will the $3 Billion Crypto Options Expiry Event Trigger a Market Surge?,https://dailycoinpost.com/will-the-3-billion-crypto-options-expiry-event-trigger-a-market-surge/,"Today marks the culmination of a significant event in the world of cryptocurrency as numerous Bitcoin and Ethereum options contracts are set to expire. Amidst Bitcoin’s recent surge to an all-time high of over $69,000, speculation abounds on whether this expiry event will further propel prices skyward or usher in a corrective phase. Approximately 29,000 Bitcoin options contracts, valued at around $2 billion, are slated to expire on March 8. While this week’s expiry is slightly smaller in scale compared to the previous week, anticipation is building for an even larger event at the end of March, with contracts worth more than $6 billion set to expire. The put/call ratio for today’s Bitcoin options expiry stands at 0.86, indicating a relatively balanced matchup between sellers of long and short contracts. The max pain point, the price at which most losses will occur upon expiry, is identified at $60,000. Notably, there is significant open interest at strike prices of $65,000 and $70,000, totaling $1.9 billion in notional value according to Deribit data. Market volatility has surged to its highest level in nearly a year, as reported by crypto derivatives tooling provider Greeks Live. All major term implied volatility (IV) is on an upward trajectory, with ultra-short-term IVs reaching as high as 100%. Implied volatility serves as a metric for forecasting the market’s expectations regarding future price movements of an option’s underlying asset. Furthermore, Ethereum options are also set to expire, totaling around 270,000 contracts with a put/call ratio of 0.55 and a notional value of $1.05 billion. The max pain point for Ethereum is identified at $2,950, with significant open interest observed at strike prices of $3,000 and $4,000, particularly the latter with $826 million in notional value. In terms of the broader crypto market outlook, the total market capitalization has increased by 2.2% to reach $2.67 trillion. Bitcoin is nearing $67,000, having experienced a daily increase of 1.8%, while Ethereum has seen a more significant uptick of 3.6%, surpassing $3,900 for the first time in over two years. Interestingly, Binance Coin (BNB) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have emerged as the top performers of the day, with BNB witnessing a 10% increase to reach $468, and SHIB surging by 11%, edging closer to a top ten position by market cap.

2024-03-08 07:30:27+00:00,BlackRock Looks to Acquire Bitcoin ETFs for Global Allocation Fund,https://dailycoinpost.com/blackrock-looks-to-acquire-bitcoin-etfs-for-global-allocation-fund/,"In a notable strategic move, BlackRock, the leading asset management firm globally, has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to incorporate Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) into its Global Allocation Fund. This maneuver marks a significant shift for BlackRock towards embracing Bitcoin and signals a broader acknowledgment of cryptocurrency’s role in mainstream investment portfolios. The filing outlines BlackRock’s intention to invest in Bitcoin ETFs that directly hold BTC, with the aim of tracking the cryptocurrency’s market performance closely. It specifies, “The Fund may acquire shares in exchange-traded products (‘ETPs’) that seek to reflect generally the performance of the price of Bitcoin by directly holding Bitcoin (‘Bitcoin ETPs’), including shares of a Bitcoin ETP sponsored by an affiliate of BlackRock.” Moreover, it emphasizes that any investments in Bitcoin ETPs will be limited to those listed and traded on recognized national securities exchanges. This strategic move is part of BlackRock’s broader investment strategy for its Global Allocation Fund, a mutual fund designed to offer investors global diversification through a wide range of assets, such as equities, bonds, and potentially Bitcoin ETPs now. With $17.8 billion in assets under management (AUM) and a year-to-date return of 4.61% as of March 7, the Fund aims to leverage global investment opportunities while managing risk and pursuing long-term capital growth and income. Analysts in the cryptocurrency space have remarked on the significance of BlackRock’s decision. MacroScope commented, “A new filing by BlackRock late this afternoon. As I’ve been saying, you’re going to see a lot of this in the coming months from Wall Street firms for their in-house investment funds.” This sentiment reflects a growing consensus that major institutional investors are poised to enter the cryptocurrency space, potentially driving increased demand and adoption.

Given the strength exhibited by the BTC market, BlackRock’s move into spot BTC ETFs could position its funds to benefit from the digital asset’s potential for high returns. However, despite the Strategic Income Opportunities Fund’s larger size, boasting an AUM of $36.7 billion, it has shown underperformance this year, with a modest year-to-date gain of 0.59%. The SEC’s decision on BlackRock’s filings is pending, awaiting approval from chairman Gary Gensler’s commission. Nonetheless, BlackRock’s initiative to include BTC in its funds represents an extremely bullish signal that could encourage other asset managers to explore Bitcoin as a viable component of diversified investment portfolios.

With Bitcoin now soaring to all-time highs, President Bukele’s optimism is palpable. In a recent tweet, he exclaimed, “If we sold now, we would make a profit of more than 40%,” indicating a significant turnaround in the country’s fortunes. As of February 28th, according to the Nayib Bukele tracker, El Salvador possesses 1,853 Bitcoins, valued at $187 million. This translates to a remarkable 54% profit, amounting to approximately $65 million – a substantial gain that Bukele intends to hold onto, affirming, “In the end, 1 BTC = 1 BTC.” While $65 million is no small sum for a country like El Salvador, it must be viewed in context. With tax revenues totaling around seven billion dollars, Bitcoin profits constitute less than one percent. Nevertheless, they offer a valuable asset that can serve as collateral for obtaining low-interest loans to finance various development projects.

Currently, the firm boasts a staggering 193,000 Bitcoins, valued at $12.76 billion. With an average purchase price exceeding $30,000, MicroStrategy has realized a remarkable profit of 108%, totaling $6.5 billion. This remarkable success underscores the efficacy of the Bitcoin strategy for MicroStrategy and its CEO, Michael Saylor.

Let’s delve into the factors propelling this surge in the cryptocurrency. After hovering around $62,000 for a brief period, Bitcoin has embarked on an upward trend, reclaiming its previous high of $64,000 and surpassing it to reach $65,000. Within a span of 24 hours, Bitcoin has showcased a remarkable gain of over 5%, positioning itself as one of the top performers in the market, trailing only behind Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) among the top 10 coins by market capitalization. This surge has propelled Bitcoin back to the peak observed in April 2021, leaving it merely 6% away from reaching the all-time high of $69,000 set in November 2021. With Bitcoin’s recent surge, investors are naturally curious about the driving forces behind this bullish momentum. While numerous factors contribute to such rallies, institutional buying pressure emerges as a significant catalyst. According to insights shared by Maartunn, the community manager of CryptoQuant Netherlands, the BTC Coinbase Premium Gap has exhibited positive trends recently. This metric tracks the variance between Bitcoin prices listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair), providing insights into the buying and selling behaviors across the two platforms. A positive premium indicates that Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase surpasses that on Binance. Given Coinbase’s popularity among US-based institutional entities and Binance’s global reach, a positive premium suggests heightened buying pressure from American investors, colloquially referred to as “whales.” The Coinbase bidder doesn’t care about weekends pic.twitter.com/1MubQZJlhe — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) March 2, 2024  Observing the chart depicting the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap, it’s evident that the gap turned positive towards the end of February and persisted into the early days of March. The surge in the premium coincided with Bitcoin’s initial rise above $60,000, indicating the participation of institutional investors in driving the price upwards. The weekend also witnessed significant values of the indicator, potentially fueling Bitcoin’s latest rally. Monitoring the Coinbase Premium Gap in the days ahead could offer valuable insights, as sustained buying activity from American traders may signal further upward movement for Bitcoin. In conclusion, institutional buying pressure, as indicated by the positive trends in the BTC Coinbase Premium Gap, appears to be a key factor driving Bitcoin’s recent surge beyond $65,000, setting the stage for potential future gains.

2024-03-04 08:27:48+00:00,Bitcoin’s Historic Surge: Is a ‘God Candle’ on the Horizon?,https://dailycoinpost.com/bitcoins-historic-surge-is-a-god-candle-on-the-horizon/,"Bitcoin has recently witnessed an unprecedented surge, marking its largest monthly gain and longest green candle in history. This surge has sparked speculation about the possibility of what traders colloquially refer to as a “God candle.”  A God candle is a monumental candlestick pattern indicating a significant surge in an asset’s value. It stands out as the largest candle on a trading chart and is often viewed with incredulity due to its seemingly miraculous nature. Analysts suggest that a God candle could potentially propel an asset to substantial new highs. While Bitcoin experienced notable surges in February, March, and October of 2021, none matched the magnitude of the recent rally. In February 2021, Bitcoin saw a $12,100 green candle, representing a monthly surge of 36%. The digital currency started the month trading at $33,128 and closed at $45,238 after reaching a peak of $58,372. The following month saw another significant candle, with a $13,500 gain and a 29% rally. In October of the same year, Bitcoin surged from $43,822 to $61,357, resulting in a $17,500 candle, the second largest in history until last month’s rally. In the most recent surge, Bitcoin climbed from $42,580 to $63,999, closing at $61,206 and printing a candle of approximately $20,000, the largest in its history. This surge was attributed to several factors, including a breakthrough of significant resistance levels and short-term price targets. High demand from large U.S. investors, particularly within the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, played a crucial role. The introduction of nine new spot products in this market fueled demand, outstripping supply from Bitcoin miners nearly tenfold and driving up the asset’s price. Analysts anticipate sustained demand as institutions and high-profile investors leverage these regulated products to gain exposure to Bitcoin. This suggests the possibility of Bitcoin surpassing its all-time high of $69,000 before the next halving event in April. With this trajectory, there is speculation that Bitcoin may print a God candle in the near future as it continues its ascent toward predicted peaks, potentially reaching $120,000.

2024-03-04 07:38:58+00:00,Spot Bitcoin Etfs Positively Impact Markets Amid Funding Rate Concerns,https://dailycoinpost.com/spot-bitcoin-etfs-positively-impact-markets-amid-funding-rate-concerns/,"QCP Capital highlights the role of spot Bitcoin ETFs in bolstering Bitcoin’s potential while cautioning against unsustainable funding rates. The ongoing surge in Bitcoin prices challenges earlier market predictions regarding the influence of spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, previously anticipated to drive the cryptocurrency to new all-time highs by March’s end. With Bitcoin surpassing the $59,000 mark on Wednesday, marking a notable 5% increase, signs point towards a potential new peak materializing sooner than initially expected. The current rally is primarily fueled by heightened demand, evident in spot ETF volumes surpassing $3.2 billion with net inflows totaling $520 million. This rapid price surge has prompted short liquidations and incited speculative buying, causing funding rates to spike on native exchanges and extending to longer-end futures trading, reaching over 16% above the spot price. QCP Capital’s recent analysis reveals that the initial response from the options market was unexpectedly restrained. Traders holding long calls were actively capitalizing on profits, and interest in downside gamma was evident. Consequently, risk reversals, reflecting the difference between call-implied volatility and put-implied volatility, remained around 3%, a deviation from the norm considering the magnitude of the spot price movement. Despite the continuous climb in spot prices, demand for volatility surged, although such spikes in fluctuation were promptly sold off. Despite significant price movements, the prevailing upward trajectory has maintained realized volatility close to 40%. The crypto asset trading firm identifies the $60k strike as a natural target for March’s expiry. Looking forward, QCP Capital acknowledges the potential dampening of speculative fervor due to unsustainable funding rates, possibly resulting in leverage washouts and a retreat to the $50,000 level. However, the ongoing influx of substantial spot ETF inflows acts as a counterbalance, likely sustaining the upward trend, particularly with the upcoming BTC halving on the horizon. The recent surge in Bitcoin’s price reignites interest among traders and speculators, as observed by Glassnode. Across various Bitcoin investor groups, including institutional buyers and short-term holders, risk appetite is increasing. Data from the on-chain intelligence platform indicates heightened trading and speculative activities, fueled by nearly record-breaking daily exchange volumes of $5.57 billion, primarily influenced by short-term holders.

2024-03-03 11:35:06+00:00,Indonesia’s Crypto Sector: Evolving Taxation Strategies and Regulatory Outlook,https://dailycoinpost.com/indonesias-crypto-sector-evolving-taxation-strategies-and-regulatory-outlook/,"Indonesia’s cryptocurrency market is undergoing a significant period of transition and evaluation, marked by dwindling tax revenues and proposed regulatory adjustments. Despite the surge in Bitcoin’s value in 2023, the country experienced a substantial decline of over 60% in crypto tax revenue compared to the previous year, prompting concerns regarding the efficacy of the existing tax framework. Introduced in May 2022, Indonesia’s dual taxation system for crypto transactions has faced criticism for its potential to impede market expansion. Initially established when digital currencies were categorized as commodities, this tax structure is currently under scrutiny by the Ministry of Finance, headed by Sri Mulyani. Stakeholders, including the Commodity Futures Trading Supervisory Agency (Bappebti) and local exchanges, have advocated for a reevaluation of the current tax framework. Tirta Karma Senjaya, the Head of CoFTRA’s Market Development and Development Bureau, emphasized the necessity of periodic tax assessments, recognizing the evolving nature of cryptocurrencies and their prospective contribution to future revenue streams. Local exchanges have voiced concerns that the prevailing high tax rates discourage user engagement and steer individuals towards unregulated platforms. They propose a streamlined tax system, potentially incorporating a single income tax, to cultivate a more conducive and competitive environment for legitimate crypto enterprises.  The impending transfer of regulatory oversight from Bappebti to the Financial Services Authority (OJK) in January 2025 is anticipated to shape the future landscape of crypto taxation in Indonesia. This transition could facilitate the establishment of a more comprehensive regulatory framework and potentially lead to adjustments in the current tax regime. While recognizing the sector’s potential, the government remains vigilant regarding associated risks. The recent identification of over 300 illegal crypto exchanges operating within the country underscores the challenges of effectively regulating and taxing the digital currency market. These unauthorized platforms pose a significant threat to tax system integrity, operating beyond the regulatory purview. The Indonesian government is committed to fostering responsible growth in the Bitcoin sector while prioritizing financial stability and safeguarding the integrity of the national currency, the Rupiah. The recent prohibition of crypto payments for tourists in Bali exemplifies this cautious stance. Though the specifics of forthcoming regulatory and tax changes are yet to be fully delineated, Indonesia is actively navigating the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrencies. The ensuing months are expected to witness further developments as the government endeavors to strike a balance between promoting innovation and preserving the resilience of its financial system.

2024-03-02 11:53:50+00:00,"Novogratz from Galaxy Warns of a Potential Bitcoin Drop to $55,000 – Here’s Why",https://dailycoinpost.com/novogratz-from-galaxy-warns-of-a-potential-bitcoin-drop-to-55000-heres-why/,"In the world of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains a magnet for investors, recently surpassing the $64,000 mark, showcasing its enduring appeal. However, amidst this bullish surge, Michael Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings, has sounded a note of caution, suggesting a looming short-term correction that could see Bitcoin’s value dip back to the mid-$50,000 range. Novogratz’s foresight was unveiled during a candid interview on Bloomberg TV, where he dissected the current cryptocurrency landscape. He described the recent market frenzy as a phase of “price discovery,” attributing it partly to the introduction of Bitcoin spot ETFs, which have injected fresh capital into the sector. Despite the overall optimism, Novogratz expressed reservations regarding the market’s reliance on leverage, particularly among younger investors whom he labeled as “millennials and Gen Z” enticed by the allure of quick profits. He cautioned: You’ve got a lot of millennials and Gen Z YOLOing it, and they all will get some of that money and a lot of ’em will get wiped out. This demographic’s penchant for high-risk trading strategies could potentially trigger substantial market corrections, underscoring the inherent dangers of speculative investing. The recent pullback from Bitcoin’s peak of $64,000 has already resulted in nearly $300 million in liquidations within a 24-hour period, impacting nearly 100,000 traders, according to Coinglass data. This serves as a stark reminder of the high-stakes nature of cryptocurrency trading, where swift price movements can wreak havoc on investors’ portfolios. Novogratz also noted a shift in leverage dynamics between the 2021 bull market and the current landscape. While institutional players have tempered their reliance on leverage, retail traders, particularly those operating through offshore platforms, continue to embrace high-risk trading practices. Despite the short-term turbulence, Novogratz maintains a bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. He underscored the cyclical nature of the market, suggesting that while short-term “boom-bust” cycles are inevitable, the overall trend for Bitcoin remains positive. This sentiment is echoed by the increasing interest from both individual and institutional investors in incorporating Bitcoin into their portfolios, recognizing its intrinsic value as a digital asset. Furthermore, on-chain data highlights an intriguing trend among “newbie whales,” or Bitcoin holders who have entered the market within the past 155 days. According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, this group of investors currently holds an all-time high amount of unrealized profit following the recent rally. #Bitcoin newbie whales reached an all-time high of $7.3 billion in unrealized profits, marking unprecedented gains. pic.twitter.com/lCwfoK15ng — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) February 28, 2024  Bitcoin Maximalist and Toxic to our banking and monetary system.

Recently, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlit bitcoin exchange-traded funds, prompting Bank of America’s Merrill and Wells Fargo to grant select wealth management clients access to them, as reported by Bloomberg. Major asset managers in the US, including Fidelity and BlackRock, have emerged as issuers of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Initially, traditional banks and wirehouses were hesitant to offer this product to clients. Vanguard, Citi Bank, and UBS abstained from embracing the Bitcoin-backed investment vehicle upon its launch, according to earlier reports. The acceptance of bitcoin ETFs by mainstream brokerage platforms underscores the shifting perspective of large corporations towards cryptocurrencies, viewing them as viable investment avenues rather than purely speculative assets. Retail investors now have the opportunity to track bitcoin price fluctuations through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) without the necessity of purchasing the cryptocurrency directly from less regulated exchanges.

In a statement sent via email on Thursday, Wells Fargo disclosed that spot bitcoin ETFs are available for “unsolicited purchases” through advisors with Wells Fargo Advisors or via their online WellsTrade platform. With the rising prices of Bitcoin, spot Bitcoin ETF providers have amassed over $20 billion in assets under management (AUM). As the ETF wrapper attracts investments from retail investors, hedge funds, and other capital allocators, the token has seen a 50% increase in value so far this year. Moreover, these investment vehicles have witnessed record-breaking trading volumes in the weeks following the approval of 11 spot bitcoin ETFs by US regulators in January. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart reported that trading activity for 10 ETFs surpassed $7.7 billion this week. The new record for #Bitcoin ETF trading volume is officially $7.69 billion. Previous record was $4.66 billion from launch day. https://t.co/rZsOSUqk35 pic.twitter.com/QaOKe2LuVU — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) February 28, 2024  Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley, a prominent Wall Street institution, is reportedly contemplating offering spot BTC ETF trading to its clients. Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s chief investment officer, suggests that additional trading giants are likely to enter the market, potentially channeling billions of dollars in untapped capital into Bitcoin via ETFs. Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at Bernstein, expressed confidence earlier this week, asserting that bitcoin is on an “18-month road to $150,000” driven by unprecedented institutional adoption. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $61,200, marking a 1.5% increase daily and a 19.2% increase weekly, according to data from Coingecko.

2024-03-01 08:14:02+00:00,How Will Crypto Markets Respond to the $2 Billion Bitcoin Options Expiry?,https://dailycoinpost.com/how-will-crypto-markets-respond-to-the-2-billion-bitcoin-options-expiry/,"As Bitcoin’s price hovers around the $64,000 mark, the cryptocurrency market braces for a significant event: the expiry of $1.96 billion worth of Bitcoin options contracts on March 1. This event, representing approximately 32,200 contracts, is the second-largest expiry of the month, with another substantial expiry of over $6 billion scheduled for the end of March. Traders are closely watching the dynamics of this options expiry, particularly given the prevailing sentiment in the derivatives market. The put/call ratio stands at 1.49, indicating a higher number of sellers of short contracts (puts) compared to longs (calls). This suggests a prevailing inclination among derivatives traders towards a market correction. The “max pain point,” the price level at which most losses are expected upon expiry, is identified at $55,000, further indicating the bearish sentiment among traders. Noteworthy strike prices in the options market include $60,000 and $65,000. At the $60,000 strike price, there are 15,329 calls with a notional value of $934 million, indicating significant bullish sentiment. Conversely, at the $65,000 strike price, there are 14,137 calls with a notional value of $861 million.  Deribit, a leading crypto derivatives provider, reports an all-time high in open interest, which surpassed $29 billion on February 29. Additionally, the platform witnessed a record 24-hour trading volume of $12.4 billion, underscoring the heightened activity in the derivatives market. Beyond Bitcoin, the expiry of 235,000 Ethereum contracts, with a notional value of $793 million, is also noteworthy. The put/call ratio for Ethereum contracts stands at 0.88, indicating a more balanced distribution between long and short positions. In terms of market outlook, the broader cryptocurrency market has experienced a slight retreat, with total capitalization currently at $2.37 trillion. Bitcoin has retraced to $60,878, while Ethereum follows suit, dipping to $3,372. This correction comes after a period of significant rallying in the markets. While the options expiry event looms large, its direct impact on spot markets may be limited. The prevailing sentiment suggests that a correction is due, irrespective of the expiry event. As such, market participants are anticipating further downward pressure in the near term. In conclusion, the $2 billion Bitcoin options expiry event presents a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. Traders are closely monitoring the dynamics of the derivatives market, with prevailing sentiment pointing towards a correction. However, the broader market outlook suggests that the expiry event may not significantly alter the trajectory of the ongoing correction.

2024-02-29 08:07:33+00:00,"Bitcoin surges to $60,000 as Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) Demand Propels Towards a Record High",https://dailycoinpost.com/bitcoin-surges-to-60000-as-exchange-traded-fund-etf-demand-propels-towards-a-record-high/,"At the core of the upward momentum propelling Bitcoin towards an all-time high lies a fundamental economic principle: the interplay of supply and demand. The surge in demand for Bitcoin, spurred by the introduction of new exchange-traded funds, significantly surpasses the rate of new tokens entering circulation through the mining process, as well as the quantity of Bitcoin available for sale by long-term holders. This fundamental disequilibrium has ignited the cryptocurrency market, with traders amplifying the momentum by increasingly engaging in leveraged positions, betting on the continuation of the upward trajectory. On Wednesday, Bitcoin breached the $60,000 threshold for the first time in over two years, marking a staggering 40 percent surge since the beginning of the year. This surge has been largely catalyzed by the successful launch of U.S. exchange-traded funds, which commenced trading on January 11th and have garnered over $6 billion in investments. Notably, Bitcoin last attained the $60,000 mark in November 2021, following an all-time high of nearly $69,000 earlier that same month. Moreover, an imminent reduction in Bitcoin’s supply growth, known as the halving, has contributed to the prevailing optimism among investors. This sentiment has sustained a prolonged rally, concurrently fostering speculative interest in alternative tokens such as Ether and Dogecoin. Zaheer Ebtikar, founder of crypto fund Split Capital, observed, “We are witnessing a clear ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) rally. A growing number of individuals are increasingly convinced to invest.” It is pertinent to acknowledge that halvings previously exerted a considerable influence on Bitcoin prices, given that miners wielded substantial control over the issuance of new tokens. However, their influence has diminished significantly as the majority of tokens have already been mined and are actively traded in the market. On Wednesday, Bitcoin surged by as much as 13 percent to reach $63,968.23 before retracing gains and briefly dipping below the $60,000 mark. Concurrently, Coinbase Global Inc. reported instances of users encountering difficulties in executing transactions, albeit reassuring customers that their assets remain secure.  The relentless rally positions Bitcoin for its most substantial monthly gain since December 2020, when the digital asset surged by 50 percent to approximately $9,600. Since the onset of last year, Bitcoin’s value has more than tripled, rebounding from a 64 percent downturn in 2022. This remarkable resurgence follows a series of scandals and bankruptcies within the crypto industry, which had previously cast doubt on the viability of digital assets. Remarkably, digital tokens are experiencing notable appreciation despite investors moderating their expectations for looser monetary policies, as evidenced by the uptick in U.S. Treasury yields. In 2024, Bitcoin has outpaced traditional assets like stocks and gold. Michael Safai, co-founder at quantitative trading firm Dexterity Capital, remarked, “This reversal is particularly impressive given central banks’ indications of maintaining high-interest rates for the foreseeable future, challenging the notion that the next crypto bull run would hinge on declining interest rates.” The substantial influx of capital into Bitcoin ETFs has prompted industry observers to caution against an impending supply crunch, as the pace of new coin issuance fails to match the escalating demand. Approximately 80 percent of Bitcoin’s supply has remained dormant for the past six months, potentially exacerbating the supply shortage and exerting upward pressure on prices, analysts contend. The introduction of nine new spot ETFs has resulted in an accumulation of over 300,000 Bitcoin, equivalent to seven times the volume of new coins mined since January 11th. Following the halving, anticipated in late April, the daily issuance of new coins will decline from 900 to 450. Should demand persist at current levels amidst a halved supply, proponents anticipate further upward momentum in prices. Dan Slavin, founder of Chainview Capital, a crypto hedge fund, remarked, “The confluence of these factors creates a significant imbalance between supply and demand. With demand outstripping supply, price appreciation ensues. Given Bitcoin’s volatility, price appreciation transcends modest gains, leading to substantial increases.” However, the rapid pace of the rally has prompted some observers to caution against the susceptibility of investors to the boom-and-bust cycles synonymous with the cryptocurrency market. Jaime Baeza, founder at crypto hedge fund AnB Investments, cautioned, “This rally has been swift, accompanied by elevated leverage, as evidenced by derivatives metrics and funding rates. Therefore, a substantial correction of 20 percent or more would not be surprising. Nonetheless, I would refrain from shorting into this rally while it maintains its current pace.”   Bitcoin Maximalist and Toxic to our banking and monetary system.

2024-02-28 09:24:52+00:00,The imminent Correction of Bitcoin – A Matter of Timing,https://dailycoinpost.com/the-imminent-correction-of-bitcoin-a-matter-of-timing/,"While Bitcoin is surging toward $60k the looming correction of Bitcoin (BTC) is a topic that starts garnering attention, sparking debates among market participants. The central question revolves around when this correction will occur, with conflicting forecasts adding to the uncertainty. One of the key points of contention is whether the correction will precede or follow the upcoming halving event. Views on this matter are divergent, with some predicting a pre-halving correction while others anticipate a surge in prices before any downturn. On one side of the debate, CryptoOnchain, an anonymous analyst on CryptoQuant, has suggested that Bitcoin could see a downturn to $48,000 in the near future. This analysis is primarily based on the Short Term Holder (STH) Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which tracks the behavior of short-term investors. An STH-SOPR value exceeding 1 indicates profit-taking by investors, while a value below 1 suggests losses. Currently, the STH-SOPR has surpassed 1, indicating a potential correction in line with previous patterns.  Supporting this view, technical analysis also suggests that Bitcoin is nearing a selling zone for short-term investors, with resistance levels on the technical chart reinforcing the likelihood of a correction. However, on the other side of the spectrum, analyst Michaël van de Poppe offers a contrasting perspective. He believes that while a correction is inevitable, Bitcoin could first surge to $54,000 or $58,000 before any significant downturn. Van de Poppe also warns that the correction post-halving could be more severe, possibly dropping Bitcoin’s price to as low as $40,000. I’m unaware whether we will get this correction on #Bitcoin in the short term. I think that this rally is going to peak between $54-58K and provide a substantial correction to $40-42K after the halving has taken place. pic.twitter.com/vW2t7sklPh — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) February 25, 2024  Examining historical trends, it’s evident that Bitcoin often experiences price appreciation leading up to halving events, followed by significant declines thereafter. For instance, prior to the second halving in July 2016, Bitcoin surged to $617 before witnessing a notable drop. A similar pattern was observed during the third halving, with Bitcoin reaching $9,619 before experiencing a considerable decline in the weeks following the event. In conclusion, while opinions differ on the timing and extent of Bitcoin’s correction, the historical context and current indicators suggest that a correction is on the horizon, with the only uncertainty being exactly when it will occur.

2024-02-27 08:21:52+00:00,Bitcoin’s Sudden Surge to $57000: A Bull Trap or Organic Demand?,https://dailycoinpost.com/bitcoins-sudden-surge-to-57000-a-bull-trap-or-organic-demand/,"In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, few events catch the attention of traders and enthusiasts like a sudden surge in the price of Bitcoin (BTC). Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has defied expectations, catapulting from $50,000 to $57,000, leaving many scratching their heads in bewilderment. However, amidst this seemingly bullish momentum, a curious trend emerges – altcoins, typically known to follow Bitcoin’s lead, have remained relatively stagnant. This raises significant questions about the sustainability and underlying motives of Bitcoin’s rapid ascent. Unraveling the Puzzle: The Bull Trap Hypothesis Against this backdrop, the concept of a bull trap emerges as a compelling narrative. A bull trap refers to a deceptive upward movement in price, enticing traders to enter bullish positions before swiftly reversing course. The confluence of factors – a surge in price amidst weakening indicators, lack of significant news, and altcoins’ reluctance to rally – aligns eerily with the characteristics of a classic bull trap. As Bitcoin’s price continues its meteoric rise, caution flags fly high. While the surge may appear enticing at first glance, a deeper examination reveals cracks in the facade. The market’s reluctance to fully embrace Bitcoin’s rally, coupled with weakening indicators and absence of significant catalysts, paints a picture of uncertainty and skepticism. As traders navigate these treacherous waters, one thing remains clear – in the world of cryptocurrencies, not everything is as it seems, and what begins as a bull’s triumph may end as a bear’s trap.

Recent data released by CoinShares indicates that these investment products have garnered approximately $598 million in investments solely over the past week. This considerable influx of capital contributes to a year-to-date total of $5.7 billion, underscoring a persistent interest in digital assets among both institutional and retail investors. It is pertinent to highlight that the surge in investments has predominantly been propelled by the introduction of new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. These ETFs have swiftly gained traction, attracting substantial net flows. James Butterfill, CoinShares’ Head of Research, underscored the significance of these inflows, noting their contribution to 55% of the record inflows observed throughout 2021. The data also unveils intriguing regional patterns in cryptocurrency investments. Funds based in the US led the way with the most significant inflows, totaling approximately $610 million. However, despite this favorable momentum, Grayscale, an established issuer, experienced outflows amounting to $436 million. Meanwhile, Brazil and Switzerland recorded modest inflows of $8.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Conversely, Canada witnessed substantial outflows, nearing $20 million from digital asset investment products.  Source: Coinshares In terms of asset preference, Bitcoin-based funds dominated the inflows, amassing $570 million in investments. This surge primarily emanates from spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, which have accumulated over $5.5 billion in net flows since their inception earlier this year. Ethereum products also witnessed notable inflows, totaling $17 million. Additionally, funds based on Chainlink and XRP saw significant inflows of $1.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively.  Bitcoin’s price surged to $57,000 stealing the show, while other cryptocurrencies are following.  However, certain assets encountered challenges. Solana investment products, for instance, witnessed outflows for the second consecutive week, totaling $3 million. It is worth to mention that in similar situations when bitcoins makes this 10% legs up it only a matter of time when bitcoin starts to cool of and Altcoins start their big moves.   Bitcoin Maximalist and Toxic to our banking and monetary system.

2024-02-26 09:36:34+00:00,This $30 Billion Investment Powerhouse Expands Client Portfolios with Bitcoin Exposure,https://dailycoinpost.com/this-30-billion-investment-powerhouse-expands-client-portfolios-with-bitcoin-exposure/,"Carson Group, a registered investment advisory firm managing assets totaling $30 billion, has recently announced a strategic decision to integrate exposure to spot Bitcoin into its portfolio offerings, marking its initial foray into facilitating investments in this digital asset. The emergence of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have garnered substantial attention even prior to regulatory approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January, underscores this move. These ETFs present investors with a means to access Bitcoin’s market without direct ownership of the cryptocurrency. Among the array of ETF options available in the United States, Carson Group has opted for four distinct offerings, focusing notably on their substantial asset base and cost-efficiency. Bloomberg disclosures reveal Carson Group’s embrace of Bitcoin as a significant milestone, aligning the firm with a growing cohort of traditional investment entities embracing this digital asset. The selected ETFs include the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), and Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC). Grant Engelbart, Vice President and Investment Strategist at Carson Group, elucidated the rationale behind the firm’s selection process, citing the prioritization of assets under management and trading volume. IBIT and FBTC were favored for their demonstrated prowess in these domains, boasting leading positions in daily inflows and trading activity. Engelbart emphasized the significance of offering products from major asset management entities, citing this as a driving factor in Carson Group’s decision-making process. Additionally, the firm’s considerations extended to cost-effective features, resulting in the inclusion of Bitwise Bitcoin ETF and Franklin Bitcoin ETF despite their comparatively lower inflows. Both BITB and EZBC are characterized by competitive fee structures, charging 0.2% and 0.19% respectively, representing the lowest fees within the industry. Carson Group’s integration of Bitcoin ETFs underscores a broader trend of mainstream adoption among traditional investors, further solidifying Bitcoin’s position within investment portfolios. This development contrasts with the stance taken by certain investment firms, such as Vanguard, which have opted against offering Bitcoin ETFs or similar cryptocurrency-related products to their clientele. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to witness substantial trading activity and asset growth, with cumulative trading volume reaching $50 billion and net inflows amounting to $232.3 million as of last week. Notable ETFs, such as IBIT, FBTC, and BITB, boast significant asset bases ranging from $1.1 billion to over $6.64 billion, further indicating heightened investor interest and confidence in Bitcoin as a viable investment avenue.

2024-02-25 14:57:34+00:00,Retail Traders’ Presence Still Lacking: Expectations for Bitcoin to Reach New ATH Soon,https://dailycoinpost.com/retail-traders-presence-still-lacking-expectations-for-bitcoin-to-reach-new-ath-soon/,"It’s evident from Google search data that retail investors have yet to significantly engage in the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin’s price has experienced a substantial uptrend in recent months, skyrocketing from below $20,000 to over $50,000 since June 2023. Although this surge was primarily fueled by the anticipation and subsequent approval of nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, retail traders have notably remained on the sidelines. This prompts the question of whether their participation could drive another surge in the asset’s price in the coming months. The Journey So Far Data derived from Google Trends illustrates the typical behavior of retail investors, who often exhibit heightened interest in investment opportunities during periods of significant market activity. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as FOMO (fear of missing out), typically results in increased market participation from retail investors. The cryptocurrency market is particularly susceptible to such sentiment shifts, often experiencing rapid overheating when demand from retail investors surges. This typically leads to inflated prices followed by corrective phases as the market cools off. The most recent cycle occurred in 2021, characterized by soaring prices and widespread retail investor involvement. However, the anticipated price milestones were not met, leading to a decline in Bitcoin’s value and a subsequent retreat of retail investors from the market. Bitcoin began its recovery in June 2023 following BlackRock’s filing to launch its own spot BTC ETF. With BlackRock’s track record of success with ETFs, institutional interest in Bitcoin heightened, shifting the prevailing sentiment from skepticism about SEC approval to a more optimistic outlook. This shift sparked increased hype and, consequently, a surge in prices, propelling BTC from under $20,000 in June 2023 to over $40,000 by early January. Subsequently, the approval of 11 spot BTC ETFs led to a “sell-the-news” moment, followed by renewed demand for cryptocurrency and a surge past $50,000 for the first time in over two years. Retail Participation Despite significant institutional interest and large-scale investments in Bitcoin, reports suggest that smaller retail investors have been offloading their BTC holdings. Google Trends data corroborates this trend, indicating that global searches for Bitcoin are well below the levels observed during the 2017 boom, the 2021 bull run, and even the 2022 market crashes.  Apart from a brief uptick in searches surrounding the ETF approvals in mid-January, search volumes have barely surpassed those observed during the 2019 bear market and the 2020 Covid-induced correction. This indicates a notable absence of retail investors, despite Bitcoin’s price more than doubling since June last year. However, the upcoming halving event could potentially alter this dynamic, considering Bitcoin’s historical price performance following previous halvings. Therefore, it will be intriguing to monitor whether retail investors will drive another rally, potentially propelling Bitcoin to achieve a new all-time high in the coming months.

While expressing his continued preference for the US dollar, he acknowledged the growing acceptance of Bitcoin among the general public. He pointed out the escalating demand for Bitcoin transactions, signaling a notable shift in financial preferences. In a surprising move, Trump indicated a willingness to accommodate Bitcoin, stating, “You’re seeing something that’s interesting, I can live with it.” This statement marks a departure from his earlier stance and suggests a newfound acceptance of Bitcoin’s role in the contemporary financial landscape. Despite this newfound openness, Trump reiterated his allegiance to the US dollar, emphasizing its strength and stability. This underscores his continued support for traditional fiat currencies while acknowledging the emergence of alternatives such as Bitcoin. Trump’s remarks come at a time of ongoing debate surrounding cryptocurrency regulation. While some advocate for minimal intervention to foster innovation, others argue for tighter oversight to mitigate potential risks. Trump’s call for “some regulation” appears to align with the latter viewpoint, indicating a pragmatic approach to managing the cryptocurrency sector. Reactions to Trump’s apparent shift towards Bitcoin have been mixed. While some view it as a significant endorsement that could bolster Bitcoin’s credibility, others remain cautious, questioning whether Trump’s words will translate into tangible actions. Trump’s evolving stance adds a layer of complexity to discussions regarding the future of finance. As digital currencies continue to disrupt traditional systems, influential figures like Trump wield considerable influence in shaping perceptions and regulatory frameworks surrounding cryptocurrencies.

2024-02-24 09:40:43+00:00,New Insights from Unseen Satoshi Nakamoto Emails Illuminate Bitcoin’s Origin Story,https://dailycoinpost.com/new-insights-from-unseen-satoshi-nakamoto-emails-illuminate-bitcoins-origin-story/,"Newly discovered emails between Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, and Martii Malmi, an early contributor to the project, provide more information about how Bitcoin started and what Nakamoto was thinking at the time. These emails were shared by Malmi during a trial involving the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) and Craig Wright, who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto. The trial aims to determine if Wright’s claims are true. The emails reveal conversations between Nakamoto and Malmi from the early days of Bitcoin, giving us a glimpse into Nakamoto’s ideas about Bitcoin’s future. Nakamoto was cautious about how Bitcoin would be viewed legally and didn’t want it to be seen as an investment. In one of the emails, he wrote: “There are a lot of things you can say on the sourceforge site that I can’t say on my own site … Even so, I’m uncomfortable with explicitly saying ‘consider it an investment’. That’s a dangerous thing to say and you should delete that bullet point. It’s OK if [Bitcoin users] come to that conclusion on their own, but we can’t pitch it as that.” One interesting email discusses the creation of one of the first Bitcoin exchanges. Nakamoto suggested the idea, and Malmi implemented it. Nakamoto even helped by donating money to support the exchange. Nakamoto also talked about the importance of not relying too much on Bitcoin being anonymous, as transactions could be traced. He foresaw concerns about Bitcoin’s energy use but believed it was justified compared to traditional banking activities. Satoshi wrote at the time: “I think we should de-emphasize the anonymous angle … we can’t give the impression [Bitcoin is] automatically anonymous. It’s possible to be pseudonymous, but … If someone digs through the transaction history and starts exposing information people thought was anonymous, the backlash will be much worse if we haven’t prepared expectations …” He also mentioned that the cost of mining Bitcoin would be affected by electricity prices and that adjustable transaction fees wouldn’t be necessary for a long time, though this prediction didn’t turn out entirely accurate. He further stated: “The cost would be an order of magnitude less than the billions in banking fees that pay for all those brick and mortar buildings, skyscrapers and junk mail credit card offers.” Addressing environmental apprehensions, Nakamoto acknowledges the energy-intensive nature of Bitcoin mining but contends that it pales in comparison to the resources consumed by traditional banking infrastructure. His reflections on the trade-offs between economic liberty and conservation offer insight into his pragmatic approach to Bitcoin’s sustainability. “The value of bitcoins would be relative to the electricity consumed to produce them … If you run a computational task 24/7, not letting it idle, it uses significantly more power … The extra wattage consumed goes straight to your power bill, and the value of the bitcoins you produce would be something less than that.” Despite Nakamoto’s astute observations, some aspects of his predictions have evolved differently over time. For instance, his initial skepticism towards customizable transaction fees contrasts with the reality of rising transaction costs in recent years. Nonetheless, these unearthed emails provide invaluable historical context, offering a deeper understanding of Bitcoin’s origins and the challenges it has navigated over the years.

2024-02-22 20:48:31+00:00,Euro Collapsed Against BTC by More Than 99%: Balaji on ECB’s Bitcoin Critique,https://dailycoinpost.com/euro-collapsed-against-btc-by-more-than-99-balaji-on-ecbs-bitcoin-critique/,"The recent critique of Bitcoin by representatives of the European Central Bank (ECB) has garnered attention across social media platforms within the cryptocurrency community. Notably, high-ranking officials from the ECB likened Bitcoin to a “naked emperor” amidst the surge in interest surrounding Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States. Esteemed figures within the realm of venture capitalism, such as former Coinbase Chief Technology Officer Balaji Srinivasan, have responded to this persistent hostility from prominent EU financial overseers. The Euro has collapsed against Bitcoin. https://t.co/5gBWrDXJNz pic.twitter.com/xC2dtA8p1h — Balaji (@balajis) February 22, 2024  Balaji, in a demonstration utilizing historical data on the BTC/EUR pairing, underscored a significant trend suggesting Bitcoin’s perceived superiority as a store of value compared to the Euro. Employing a tone that blended irony with substance, he drew attention to yet another vociferous critique of Bitcoin shared by the ECB. Since the inception of Bitcoin, the Euro has experienced a remarkable depreciation, surpassing a staggering 99% against the leading cryptocurrency. This phenomenon led Balaji to assert that the Euro has effectively “collapsed” in its valuation when juxtaposed with Bitcoin. Gabor Gurbacs, a seasoned cryptocurrency advisor affiliated with VanEck and Tether Limited, echoed these sentiments, emphasizing the significance of Bitcoin ETF approvals, particularly in the United States, and cautioning against dismissing their implications. He warned European regulators that opposition to Bitcoin could potentially result in falling behind in the rapidly evolving financial landscape. Moreover, Gurbacs highlighted the fallacious nature of certain assertions made by the ECB regarding Bitcoin. The ECB’s periodic issuance of reports critical of Bitcoin’s viability as an investment, medium of exchange, and store of value has become a familiar occurrence. Drawing upon conventional arguments concerning the risks associated with Proof of Work (PoW) mining, concerns over illicit financing, and allegations of market manipulation, these reports strive to delegitimize Bitcoin’s role within the financial ecosystem. For instance, in a report released in November 2023, ECB experts projected a trajectory for Bitcoin’s obsolescence, citing concerns over its purported association with criminal activities. In a recent publication authored by Ulrich Bindseil and Jürgen Schaaf, both holding prominent positions within the ECB, familiar narratives were reiterated, characterizing Bitcoin as a facilitator of illicit transactions and highlighting its perceived inefficiencies, particularly in terms of transaction speed and cost. Additionally, the report reiterated concerns over the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, drawing parallels between its energy consumption and that of entire nations.

2024-02-22 09:03:32+00:00,Bitcoin as Payment? UK Prime Minister Dismisses Allegations of Bitcoin or $1 Million Payment for Interview,https://dailycoinpost.com/bitcoin-as-payment-uk-prime-minister-dismisses-allegations-of-bitcoin-or-1-million-payment-for-interview/,"In a recent development, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has become embroiled in a media controversy involving former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. The contention centers around an alleged request by Johnson for Bitcoin or a million-dollar fee in exchange for an interview, a claim vehemently refuted by the Prime Minister’s team. Carlson, known for his influence in Right-wing US media circles, accused Johnson of stipulating the payment for a discussion concerning Ukraine. During a recent interview with Blaze TV, Tucker Carlson claimed that Johnson’s team had indicated the possibility of an interview but attached a substantial price tag. According to Carlson, the Prime Minister insisted on a million US dollars, gold, or Bitcoin. JUST IN: Tucker Carlson says former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson asked for $1 million in US dollars, gold, or #Bitcoin for an interview. pic.twitter.com/HY1USCudKJ — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) February 20, 2024  Speaking to Blaze TV, a right-wing news outlet, Carlson stated: “After some time, one of his advisors communicated to me, ‘He will engage in discussion with you, but it will require a payment of one million dollars.'” The Telegraph reported Carlson as saying: “He demands one million dollars, payable in US dollars, gold, or bitcoin – this transpired just yesterday or the day before. Subsequently, he will engage in discussions regarding Ukraine and elucidate his stance on the matter.” Johnson’s team promptly rebuffed these allegations, asserting that it was Carlson who initiated the offer, and Johnson had initially agreed, contingent upon the funds being directed to charitable causes supporting Ukrainian veterans. However, the interview never materialized, with Johnson citing the tragic passing of Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny as a contributing factor. In an unforeseen twist, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin has become entangled in this media dispute. Carlson, while recounting the purported interview proposal, specified that Johnson had expressed a preference for a million dollars in BTC. The rationale behind this preference remains obscure, but the inclusion of Bitcoin adds an intriguing dimension to the unfolding narrative. Johnson’s team has refrained from commenting on this specific detail, leaving room for conjecture regarding the role and significance of the cryptocurrency in the proposed interview. Bitcoin, a leading digital asset that has witnessed substantial price appreciation over the past decade, has garnered attention within financial circles globally. Johnson, cognizant of Bitcoin’s remarkable performance, is purported to have faith in its sustained success. This belief is grounded in Bitcoin’s history of significant value escalation, from a nominal value of $0.003 in 2010 to approximately $69,000 in 2021. The recent approval of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) further underscores the cryptocurrency’s status as a premier asset. The convergence of politics and cryptocurrency in this narrative introduces a layer of complexity to the already contentious exchange between Johnson and Carlson. The proposition of Bitcoin as a payment method raises inquiries about the expanding influence and acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream transactions. As political discourse intersects with the financial realm, the narrative highlights the evolving landscape of media, politics, and the role of emergent technologies like Bitcoin in shaping these dynamics.

2024-02-21 17:17:40+00:00,Robust Demand for Bitcoin ETFs Evident Amidst Record Performance,https://dailycoinpost.com/robust-demand-for-bitcoin-etfs-evident-amidst-record-performance/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has surged significantly, reaching a new year-to-date pinnacle of $52,900 this week, propelled by substantial inflows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Analysts attribute this notable upswing to various pivotal factors, including escalating investor interest in these ETFs, their favorable impact on BTC price dynamics, and an overarching shift in market sentiment. This surge in BTC’s value has led to the highest weekly inflow ever recorded for Bitcoin ETFs, surpassing any other exchange-traded product among the 3,400 currently trading in the United States. Analysts contend that these inflows are playing a pivotal role in the recent recuperation of the digital asset’s price. Following a transient decline subsequent to the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, BTC has demonstrated a steady ascent, reaching its zenith since December 2021. This upward trajectory aligns with the surge in ETF inflows, suggesting a plausible correlation between the two phenomena. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which directly mirror the price of the cryptocurrency, have observed noteworthy inflows in recent weeks. As per a report by Bitfinex Alpha, these ETFs garnered net inflows surpassing $2.2 billion for the second consecutive week between February 12th and 16th. Among the myriad Spot Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has emerged as the frontrunner, attracting an astonishing $1.6 billion in inflows last week. This elevates IBIT’s year-to-date inflows to an impressive $5.2 billion, constituting nearly half of BlackRock’s total net inflows across all their ETFs. GBTC has $7bil outflows in past 5 weeks… What a chart. Outflows clearly slowing. Interested to see what happens moving forward. Play for Grayscale IMO is to launch “mini-GBTC” (spot bitcoin ETF at significantly lower fee). SPDR did this w/ GLD & GLDM. via @biancoresearch pic.twitter.com/NrZnqzUiAi — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) February 19, 2024  Other commendable performers encompass Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC) with $648.5 million, Ark Invest/21Shares’ ARKB with $405 million, and Bitwise BTC Fund (BITB) with $232.1 million in inflows. However, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) continues to grapple with outflows, with investors withdrawing $624 million last week. This downward trend has persisted since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) endorsed GBTC’s conversion from an over-the-counter product to an ETP in January, resulting in a depletion of over $7 billion in capital. Concomitant with the surge in BTC’s price, the percentage of its supply held at a profit is also on the rise. Presently, only 11% of the total BTC supply, procured above $50,000, is held at a loss. This indicates that a majority of Bitcoin holders are now in profit, conceivably contributing to a more bullish market sentiment. The Nine had biggest volume day since Day One with about $2b in combined trading thx to big contributions from $HODL, $BTCW and $BITB which all broke their personal records. For context $2b in trading would put them in Top 10ish among ETFs and Top 20ish among stocks. It’s a lot. pic.twitter.com/547pIl5grI — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) February 20, 2024 
Furthermore, the burgeoning interest in Spot Bitcoin ETFs is underscored by the trading volume, which approached nearly $2 billion last week, as reported by Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. This represents the highest total since the inaugural trading day on January 11th, underscoring significant activity within this market segment.

2024-02-21 08:13:23+00:00,Federal Reserve Official Asserts Cryptocurrency Bolsters Dollar’s Position,https://dailycoinpost.com/federal-reserve-official-asserts-cryptocurrency-bolsters-dollars-position/,"US Federal Reserve Governor Christopher J. Waller delivered remarks on the topic of de-dollarization, cryptocurrencies, and the potential advent of a digital dollar during the “Climate in Central Banking” conference held at the University of the Bahamas. The significance of the US dollar as the predominant global currency, serving as both a store of value and a standard for assessing goods, is widely acknowledged. However, concerns have been raised over its enduring position due to various factors including the emergence of the BRICS nations, developments in China, sanctions imposed on Russia, accommodative monetary policies, and the advent of cryptocurrencies. Waller addressed the notion that cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, might supplant the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Despite this speculation, Waller remains unperturbed, pointing out that the majority of decentralized currency trading occurs within pairs that include stablecoins, the vast majority of which are pegged to the dollar. Hence, cryptocurrencies are effectively transacted in dollar terms. In fact, the prevalence of stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, reinforces the dollar’s global standing, serving as modern iterations of traditional greenbacks without requiring intervention from the Federal Reserve. Much like how Amazon revolutionized commerce, digital dollars streamline currency transactions. Presently, in 2024, the dollar’s dominance remains steadfast, with approximately 60% of global reserves held in dollars or US government bonds, solidifying its status as the preferred choice in the face of inflationary pressures. Despite calls for de-dollarization and the proliferation of alternative currencies, the dollar continues to reign supreme in international transactions, accounting for 60% of all international bank loans and deposits. Waller expressed confidence that the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency is unlikely to wane in the foreseeable future, noting that recent developments have only bolstered its standing rather than diminishing it. During the subsequent question and answer session, Waller addressed inquiries regarding the Federal Reserve’s potential development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). He questioned the necessity of a CBDC, highlighting the absence of a compelling market failure in the current payment system that could only be addressed by such a digital currency. With private issuers already offering trusted digital dollar equivalents in the form of stablecoins, Waller sees limited justification for a CBDC. Regarding cryptocurrencies, Waller likened them to baseball trading cards, asserting their lack of intrinsic value. While he expressed indifference towards individuals trading cryptocurrencies through ETFs, he voiced concerns about financial institutions holding significant crypto assets in their portfolios, citing risks related to security and stability.

One such strategy gaining attention is the pre-halving correction, a phenomenon observed in the lead-up to Bitcoin’s halving events. Analysts, including those advocating the “pre-halving correction idea,” suggest that Bitcoin may experience a significant downturn in the months preceding a halving event. #BTC has one final Pre Halving Retrace left Historically, it tends to occur only a few weeks before the Halving$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/fM2l54D1w9 — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) February 15, 2024  In April, one analyst predicted a potential correction of up to 35% before the halving. While such predictions are speculative, they often influence market sentiment and trading behavior. However, amidst this anticipation of a Bitcoin correction, another intriguing idea emerges – the notion of capitalizing on the “insane alt pumps” that typically occur in the same timeframe. The pre-halving correction idea in April-35%
But we have still 15-30 days of insane alt pumps.
So an idea to manage risk here, would be to short Bitcoin here and long Alts. #bitcoin #Altcoins pic.twitter.com/U3eye4aMT0 — Adi Mugri (@adimugri) February 20, 2024  According to this analyst, despite the expected correction in Bitcoin, there could still be a window of opportunity ranging from 15 to 30 days during which alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) experience substantial price surges. To manage risk effectively in this scenario, the proposed strategy involves a combination of shorting Bitcoin while simultaneously longing altcoins. Shorting Bitcoin essentially means betting on a decline in its price. This can be achieved through derivative instruments such as futures contracts or by borrowing Bitcoin and selling it at the current market price, with the intention of buying it back at a lower price in the future. On the other hand, longing altcoins involves taking bullish positions on selected alternative cryptocurrencies, anticipating that their prices will rise. The rationale behind this strategy lies in the historical behavior of the cryptocurrency market, particularly around halving events. While Bitcoin, as the market leader, may experience temporary setbacks, altcoins often thrive during these periods of heightened market activity. This could be attributed to various factors, including speculative trading, increased attention from investors seeking alternative assets, or specific developments within individual projects. By shorting Bitcoin and longing altcoins simultaneously, investors aim to hedge their exposure to market volatility while potentially capitalizing on the upward momentum of altcoin prices. However, it’s crucial to note that this strategy comes with its own set of risks and challenges. Firstly, accurately timing the market and predicting price movements can be inherently difficult, if not impossible. While historical trends may offer insights, they do not guarantee future outcomes. Additionally, leveraged trading, which is often involved in shorting and longing positions, amplifies both potential gains and losses, adding another layer of complexity to the strategy. Another thing to support the surge in altoin prices is that the Bitcoin dominance is droppoing as it shown in the chart below.  In conclusion, the pre-halving correction presents both challenges and opportunities for crypto investors. While the prospect of a Bitcoin downturn may be unsettling, the potential for significant altcoin pumps offers a compelling alternative. By implementing a hedge trading strategy that involves shorting Bitcoin and longing altcoins, investors can navigate the volatility of the cryptocurrency market more effectively, albeit with careful consideration of the associated risks.

2024-02-19 10:33:07+00:00,"Bitcoin’s Bull Run: History Doesn’t Repeat Itself, But Often Rhymes",https://dailycoinpost.com/bitcoins-bull-run-history-doesnt-repeat-itself-but-often-rhymes/,"In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, history often serves as a guidepost, illuminating patterns and tendencies that can inform our understanding of current events. Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, has experienced several bull runs throughout its existence, each marked by surges in price and fervent investor interest. As we witness the start of another potential bull run, it’s crucial to examine the parallels with past movements and consider how the present context may shape Bitcoin’s trajectory. Bitcoin’s journey has been characterized by volatility, innovation, and widespread speculation. Since its inception in 2009, it has undergone numerous price fluctuations, attracting both fervent supporters and skeptical critics. The first major bull run occurred in 2013 when Bitcoin’s price skyrocketed from a few dollars to over $1,000, driven by increased mainstream awareness and adoption. Similarly, the 2017 bull run captured global attention as Bitcoin’s price surged to nearly $20,000, fueled by a combination of media hype, institutional interest, and speculative frenzy. However, the euphoria was short-lived, and Bitcoin subsequently experienced a prolonged bear market, with prices plummeting to around $3,000 in 2018. As we enter 2024, Bitcoin is once again making headlines with its remarkable ascent. In recent months, its price has surged past previous all-time highs, reaching a peak of $52,000 per coin at the time of writing. This resurgence has reignited interest from both retail investors and institutions, with many speculating on the factors driving this latest bull run. One key catalyst for Bitcoin’s current surge is the growing institutional adoption and acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. Major companies, financial institutions, and even governments have begun to integrate Bitcoin into their investment strategies and payment systems, lending credibility and stability to the market. Moreover, the recent approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2024 has provided a significant boost to investor confidence. ETFs offer a convenient and regulated way for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning the underlying asset, opening the floodgates for greater participation in the market. Additionally, macroeconomic factors such as inflationary pressures, geopolitical uncertainty, and the debasement of fiat currencies have prompted investors to seek alternative stores of value, with Bitcoin emerging as a viable hedge against economic instability. Another significant factor contributing to Bitcoin’s bull run is the proliferation of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which have expanded the utility and appeal of blockchain technology beyond simple peer-to-peer transactions. These innovative applications have captured the imagination of investors and entrepreneurs, driving demand for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Rhymes with the Past: While each bull run has its unique characteristics, there are striking similarities between the current market environment and previous cycles. The convergence of technological advancements, institutional adoption, and macroeconomic trends echoes the dynamics that fueled past surges in Bitcoin’s price. Conclusion: As Bitcoin embarks on another exhilarating bull run, it’s crucial to recognize the significance of past market corrections while acknowledging the unique dynamics shaping the current environment. While history can provide valuable insights, it’s important to remember that each bull run carries its own characteristics and challenges. Investors and enthusiasts should remain proactive, diversify their portfolios, and adopt sound risk management strategies to navigate the volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets. By doing so, they can capitalize on the opportunities for potential gains while mitigating the risks associated with market fluctuations. However something is sure; The only thing that we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history. Bitcoin Maximalist and Toxic to our banking and monetary system.

2024-02-16 07:39:18+00:00,The Rise of Bitcoin ETFs: A Shift in Investor Preference from Gold to Digital Assets,https://dailycoinpost.com/the-rise-of-bitcoin-etfs-a-shift-in-investor-preference-from-gold-to-digital-assets/,"In recent times, the investment landscape has undergone a notable transformation, marked by a surge in Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) dedicated to Bitcoin, while witnessing substantial outflows from gold ETFs. This trend reflects a burgeoning interest among investors in digital assets as opposed to traditional safe-haven options, signaling a significant evolution in investment strategies. Data from Farside reveals a substantial influx of $4.115 billion into Bitcoin ETFs since the approval of 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 11. This surge has been accompanied by record-breaking trading volumes, with notable instances of over 12,000 BTC net inflows across all ETFs, including a significant 10,000 BTC inflow into BlackRock alone. Impressively, spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen three consecutive days with over 10,000 BTC net inflows. In stark contrast, leading gold ETFs have experienced considerable outflows totaling $2.4 billion in 2024. Analysts, such as Eric Balchunas from Bloomberg Intelligence, highlight significant outflows from BlackRock’s iShares Gold Trust Micro and iShares Gold Trust, amounting to $230.4 million and $423.6 million, respectively. James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, provides insight into this shifting dynamic, suggesting that despite positive price action, gold ETP flows have been dwindling, with some of these outflows finding their way into Bitcoin ETPs. This observation underscores a clear correlation between the decline in gold investments and the rising appeal of BTC among ETF investors. Portfolio manager Bitcoin Munger emphasizes the magnitude of this asset transfer, stating that not only is Bitcoin attracting funds, but gold is experiencing significant outflows across many ETFs. This shift has prompted Munger to predict a rapid decline in gold’s dominance in favor of Bitcoin.  BTC has demonstrated remarkable performance, with a 22% increase since the beginning of the year, reaching a two-year high of $52,519 (on Binance) at present. Conversely, gold has seen a 3.3% decrease during the same period, hitting a two-month low of $1,988 per ounce. However, Eric Balchunas suggests that the movement away from gold ETFs might not solely be towards Bitcoin but could also be driven by a fear of missing out on US equities. The evolving investment landscape has sparked a debate between traditional and digital asset investors. Bitcoin pioneer Jameson Lopp humorously queries about the well-being of gold investor Peter Schiff, indicating the growing divide between the two camps. Mike Alfred points out the stark performance contrast between Bitcoin and gold, anticipating further skepticism from Schiff, who remains critical of Bitcoin’s rally. Indeed, Schiff continues to express skepticism about the BTC rally, attributing it to a “pump-and-dump” scheme. Despite this, BTC continues to trade at a robust $52,000, showcasing its resilience and growing appeal among investors. In summary, the surge in Bitcoin ETFs and the corresponding outflows from gold ETFs signify a notable shift in investor preference towards digital assets. While this trend is indicative of changing investment strategies, it also underscores the ongoing debate between traditional and digital asset proponents.

Buckle up because we might be on the brink of witnessing a monumental event – the Bitcoin “God Candle”! With exchanges rapidly running out of Bitcoin and only 2 million coins available on the free market, the stage is set for an exhilarating surge in value. But what exactly is a “God Candle,” and why should you be excited about it? A “God Candle” is a term used by cryptocurrency enthusiasts to describe an incredibly bullish price movement, typically characterized by a large, single-day spike in value. Imagine a candlestick chart where the price of Bitcoin skyrockets in a single, awe-inspiring leap – that’s the essence of a God Candle. And with the current supply of Bitcoin dwindling and the upcoming halving event poised to further reduce new supply, the conditions for such a spectacular move are more favorable than ever before. With only 2 million Bitcoins available on the free market, exchanges are scrambling to keep up with the surging demand for Bitcoin. This scarcity is driving up prices and creating a sense of urgency among investors to secure their coins before they become even scarcer. The upcoming halving event, which occurs approximately every four years, further adds fuel to the fire. During a halving, the reward given to Bitcoin miners for validating transactions is cut in half, effectively reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are introduced into circulation. This scarcity mechanism is built into Bitcoin’s protocol and serves to maintain its deflationary nature, making each coin more valuable over time. A sudden surge in Bitcoin’s price can lead to substantial returns for investors who have positioned themselves wisely. Moreover, it signifies a broader recognition of Bitcoin’s value proposition as a store of value and a hedge against traditional financial systems. Despite facing skepticism and regulatory challenges, Bitcoin continues to defy expectations and capture the imagination of millions around the world. Its decentralized nature and limited supply make it a compelling alternative to traditional forms of currency and a beacon of hope for those seeking financial sovereignty. The stage is set for a Bitcoin “God Candle” – a momentous event that could reshape the financial landscape for years to come. With exchanges running out of Bitcoin and the upcoming halving event poised to further tighten supply, now is the time to secure your coins and prepare for what could be an exhilarating ride. Don’t miss this chance to be part of history – get ready for the Bitcoin “God Candle” and let the excitement begin! Bitcoin Maximalist and Toxic to our banking and monetary system.

Bitcoin, the pioneer cryptocurrency, has sustained its upward trajectory, breaching the $52,000 threshold within the past 24 hours. Concurrently, various alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, have also demonstrated positive movement, with XRP reaching $0.55 and ADA approaching $0.6. BTC’s recent performance has been notably robust, culminating in a 13% gain for the week, marking its most substantial weekly increase since October of the previous year. Although Monday saw a minor retracement from $48,800 to $48,000, this setback was short-lived. Subsequently, Bitcoin surged beyond $50,000, marking its first foray into this territory since late 2021. Despite a brief downturn to $48,400 following the release of the latest US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on Tuesday, BTC quickly regained momentum. Its ascent continued, propelling it past $52,000 earlier today, establishing a new multi-year peak. Reclaiming the $1 trillion market cap milestone, Bitcoin’s market capitalization surged to $1.025 trillion, with its dominance exceeding 54%. Meanwhile, Ethereum has also showcased notable resilience, with a 2% increase in the past 24 hours propelling the second-largest cryptocurrency to $2,800, a level not seen since May 2022.  Other major altcoins, including Binance Coin, Ripple, Cardano, Avalanche, and Dogecoin, have witnessed even more significant daily gains, ranging from 3% to 4%. However, Bitcoin Cash and ICP have experienced retracements among the larger-cap altcoins. Additionally, smaller and mid-cap altcoins have also experienced notable gains over consecutive days, contributing to the collective market cap reclaiming the $2 trillion threshold on CoinGecko, and nearing that milestone on CoinMarketCap. Notably, tokens such as APT and IMX have seen increases of around 5%. Overall, the recent performance of the cryptocurrency market underscores its resilience and ongoing bullish sentiment, as evidenced by the sustained upward trajectory of leading cryptocurrencies and the broader market.

Witnessing its price surge from $38,000 to over $50,000 has left many in awe and anticipation. But what’s truly fascinating is the seemingly exponential relationship between new investments and market capitalization. For every fresh dollar injected into Bitcoin, its market cap appears to be ballooning by an astonishing $70. This revelation has sparked a frenzy among investors, fueling a recent influx of capital that has propelled Bitcoin’s market cap by $105 billion over the last three trading days alone. Such rapid growth suggests that a mere $15 billion influx could potentially double Bitcoin’s market cap to a staggering $2 trillion. It’s looking like for every new $1 invested into Bitcoin its market cap is rising by $70. The last three trading days the net inflow have equalled to $1.5B with market cap increasing by $105B.

Such projections are not merely speculative; they are grounded in the observable dynamics of the market. This surge is not merely a blip on the radar; it represents a fundamental shift in perception and adoption. Yet, amidst the fervor surrounding Bitcoin, there lies another cryptocurrency that could potentially see even greater gains: Litecoin. Given its considerably smaller market cap compared to Bitcoin, Litecoin presents an intriguing opportunity for investors seeking exponential growth. In fact, it’s speculated that Litecoin could experience a staggering 100x increase for every new dollar invested, thanks to its relatively modest market size. Consider this: a mere $10 billion influx into Litecoin could theoretically push its price to a mind-boggling $1 trillion. Such a scenario might seem improbable to some, but in the unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies, anything is possible. What’s driving this surge in investment? Several factors could be at play. Institutional interest in Bitcoin continues to grow, with major companies and financial institutions allocating significant resources to cryptocurrency. Additionally, the broader economic landscape, characterized by inflationary concerns and low interest rates, has led many investors to seek alternative stores of value, with Bitcoin emerging as a prominent candidate. Moreover, the recent regulatory clarity surrounding cryptocurrencies such as the green light to ETF-s has provided a level of reassurance to investors, further bolstering confidence in the market. As governments and regulatory bodies around the world develop clearer frameworks for digital assets, cryptocurrencies are increasingly being viewed as legitimate investment vehicles rather than mere speculative instruments. Of course, with great potential comes inherent risks. The volatile nature of cryptocurrencies means that prices can fluctuate wildly in a short period, and investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before diving in. Additionally, regulatory uncertainties and geopolitical factors could introduce unforeseen challenges to the market. Nevertheless, for those who believe in the transformative power of blockchain technology and the decentralization of finance, these developments represent a validation of their convictions. Whether Bitcoin reaches $100,000 in the next 30 days remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the journey is far from over, and the possibilities are endless.

2024-02-13 10:21:44+00:00,"Wall Street’s Growing Appetite for Bitcoin: Acquisition Outpacing Production by 12 folds , Says Financial Expert",https://dailycoinpost.com/wall-streets-growing-appetite-for-bitcoin-acquisition-outpacing-production-by-12-folds-says-financial-expert/,"Wall Street is significantly increasing its acquisition of Bitcoin, obtaining the digital asset at a rate approximately 12.5 times faster than its daily production, according to industry analyst Anthony Pompliano. This trend suggests a notable surge in confidence among major financial players regarding the future prospects of cryptocurrency, driven in part by the approaching “halving” event and recent developments allowing for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The “halving” event, scheduled for April 2024, involves a deliberate reduction in the reward for mining new Bitcoins, occurring every four years. This gradual reduction in supply, with a predetermined cap of 21 million Bitcoins, creates a scarcity that appeals to institutional investors, who anticipate a corresponding increase in value as demand exceeds available supply. Anthony Pompliano emphasized Wall Street’s enthusiasm for Bitcoin during a recent appearance on CNBC’s Squawk Box, noting that financial institutions are acquiring the cryptocurrency at a pace significantly exceeding its production rate. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $49,906, with a 3.7% increase over the past 24 hours and a 16.5% increase over the past seven days, according to data from Coingecko. The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 marked a significant milestone, providing traditional investors with a regulated avenue to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly purchasing it. Notable players in this space include Grayscale, the largest crypto asset manager, which holds over 475,000 Bitcoins, along with other major investment firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. In addition to ETFs, investment firms such as ARK Invest and VanEck are also increasing their Bitcoin holdings, collectively accumulating over 174,000 BTC units. These acquisitions represent nearly 1% of the total Bitcoin supply, underscoring the growing interest from institutional investors. Industry analysts like Pompliano believe that Bitcoin has the potential to reach new highs, surpassing its current valuation of $50,000. This optimism is grounded in economic principles, as the tightening supply resulting from the halving event, combined with escalating institutional demand, could drive prices upward. Wall Street LOVES bitcoin. They are buying up 12.5x more bitcoin per day than the network can produce. The march to a new all-time high is underway if this continues. I explain this on my segment with @SquawkCNBC this morning. pic.twitter.com/0zRc3RQ4hY — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) February 12, 2024  Despite this bullish sentiment, it’s important to acknowledge the inherent volatility of Bitcoin and the uncertainties surrounding regulatory frameworks. Governments and central banks are still grappling with how to regulate and integrate cryptocurrencies into existing financial systems. Additionally, the long-term implications of widespread cryptocurrency adoption remain uncertain. In conclusion, while Wall Street’s increasing involvement in Bitcoin signifies growing confidence in its potential, investors should approach this asset class with caution and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. Whether Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory or experiences market fluctuations, the landscape of digital assets is evolving, with Wall Street playing a significant role in shaping its future.

2024-02-12 09:07:49+00:00,Bitcoin Price Predicted to Hit $10 Million in 10-20 Years by Expert,https://dailycoinpost.com/bitcoin-price-predicted-to-hit-10-million-in-10-20-years-by-expert/,"In a recent analysis shared on the social media platform X, Fred Krueger, a renowned crypto analyst and former founder and chairman of Traffic Marketplace, made a bold prediction regarding the future of Bitcoin. Krueger suggests that within the next 10-20 years, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) could surpass the staggering $10 million mark. Krueger’s forecast is rooted in a comprehensive examination of adoption trends, technological advancements, and a comparative analysis with the growth patterns of major technological innovations and social media platforms. He begins by revisiting a question posed by Tom Lee in 2019 regarding the number of crypto owners, which was estimated to be around 500,000 at the time. Drawing parallels with mainstream social media platforms, Krueger highlights the relatively modest scale of Bitcoin’s current adoption, as evidenced by the follower counts on “crypto Twitter” compared to platforms like Instagram. He predicts a significant increase in Bitcoin adoption in the years ahead. Krueger’s analysis also delves into adoption percentages and the potential trajectory for Bitcoin’s growth. He anticipates a substantial rise in the number of Bitcoin users, likening it to the exponential growth of social media users over the past decade. Central to Krueger’s argument is the fixed supply of Bitcoin and its impact on price as adoption expands. He argues that with a fixed supply and increasing demand, the price of Bitcoin could skyrocket as more individuals adopt it. Addressing skepticism and competition from other cryptocurrencies, Krueger maintains confidence in Bitcoin’s superiority, emphasizing its unique features such as fixed supply and store of value properties. Krueger also discusses potential catalysts for Bitcoin’s adoption, including the introduction of financial instruments like spot ETFs, which could make Bitcoin more accessible to mainstream investors. He underscores the importance of technological advancements in enhancing Bitcoin’s scalability and usability. Fred Krueger’s analysis presents a compelling case for Bitcoin’s future trajectory, blending historical analogies, economic principles, and technological innovations. While his prediction of Bitcoin reaching $10 million in value within the next two decades may seem ambitious, it is grounded in a deep understanding of market dynamics and potential growth drivers. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $48,127, indicating ongoing volatility and the potential for significant price movements in the future.

This notable recovery signifies a reversal from recent challenges that led to a drop in its value below $40,000 subsequent to the approval of spot ETF trading in the United States. Recent insights gleaned from on-chain data shed light on the underlying dynamics precipitating Bitcoin’s ascent to its recent highs. Whale Accumulation: Acquisition of 140,000 BTC within Three Weeks A disclosure made on the X platform by renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez unveils a trend of accumulation among a specific segment of Bitcoin investors in recent weeks. Notably, this pertains to whales, defined as entities holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC. #Bitcoin whales have been on a buying spree, acquiring 140,000 $BTC over the past three weeks, amounting to $6.16 billion! pic.twitter.com/ViRnYiJHmp — Ali (@ali_charts) February 10, 2024  Per data furnished by on-chain analytics firm Santiment, whales in possession of 1,000 to 10,000 BTC have augmented their holdings by over 140,000 coins over the preceding three weeks, an equivalent of approximately $6.16 billion. This substantial acquisition brings the aggregate Bitcoin holdings of this particular cohort to 4.84 million BTC. Such significant acquisitions often signify a robust conviction and confidence in the premier cryptocurrency. The timing of this surge in whale activity is particularly intriguing as it aligns with heightened interest from institutional stakeholders. Recent reports from Bitcoinist indicate that issuers of new Bitcoin spot ETFs have collectively amassed over 200,000 BTC in assets under management. This pronounced uptick in whale activity augurs well for Bitcoin’s outlook, particularly amid investor optimism regarding the cryptocurrency’s potential to breach the $50,000 threshold. Elevated Trading Volume: Bitcoin Hits 4-Week High At present, Bitcoin is valued at $47,715, reflecting a marginal 0.8% increase in price over the past day. According to figures sourced from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency has registered a noteworthy surge of more than 12% in value over the past seven days. In a recent communication on X, Santiment disclosed that Bitcoin has reached a four-week peak in terms of trading volume in the preceding week. The on-chain analytics platform attributes the single-day trading volume of $39.31 billion to the recent uptick in Bitcoin’s price. #Bitcoin whales have been on a buying spree, acquiring 140,000 $BTC over the past three weeks, amounting to $6.16 billion! pic.twitter.com/ViRnYiJHmp — Ali (@ali_charts) February 10, 2024  Conversely, trading volumes for other high-cap assets have remained relatively subdued, as reported by Santiment.

2024-02-10 18:24:46+00:00,Bitcoin Miner Selling Pressure Declines as BTC Price Surpasses $47K,https://dailycoinpost.com/bitcoin-miner-selling-pressure-declines-as-btc-price-surpasses-47k/,"A recent on-chain analysis conducted by the market intelligence platform CryptoQuant reveals a notable alleviation in the selling pressure exerted by Bitcoin miners, despite a significant decrease in transaction fees. In its most recent weekly report, CryptoQuant notes that the daily volume of Bitcoin sold by miners currently stands at approximately 300 BTC, a considerable decrease from the 800 BTC daily sales recorded by these entities in November and December of 2023. Throughout 2024, the selling pressure exerted by Bitcoin miners has remained subdued, coinciding with efforts by the largest publicly traded mining firms to replenish their Bitcoin holdings. This augmentation in the holdings of these companies occurs concomitantly with a reduction in miner profitability, marking the most substantial decline observed in at least a year. Analysts at CryptoQuant indicate that metrics assessing miner profit/loss sustainability demonstrate that these entities have predominantly experienced substantial underpayment in 2024, primarily due to decreased transaction volumes on the Bitcoin network. The daily transaction count for Bitcoin has descended to a three-month nadir of 278,000 transactions, a notable decline from the all-time peak of 731,000 daily transactions registered in December. The decrease in Bitcoin transactions can be ascribed to diminished activity pertaining to Ordinals inscriptions and BRC20 tokens. This trend is further corroborated by the considerable reduction in transactions utilizing taproot addresses, which have plummeted by 76% since December. Analysts expound that the diminished transaction activity, particularly the decreased usage of taproot addresses for inscriptions and BRC20 tokens, exerts a downward pressure on Bitcoin transaction fees. Indeed, the total daily Bitcoin fees have contracted from 560 on December 15 to 53 on February 5, marking a precipitous 90% decline during this period, coinciding with the reduction in taproot transactions. In addition to the mitigation of miner selling pressure, the downward pressure on BTC’s price has moderated as the asset gravitates toward the cost basis of short-term holders and traders. Moreover, the BTC price premium observed on the crypto exchange Coinbase indicates a partial recovery in demand from Bitcoin investors in the United States. Nevertheless, participants in derivative markets have yet to regain sufficient control to sustain a substantial price rally. Sell orders continue to predominate, as evidenced by the buy-sell ratio remaining below zero. Nonetheless, BTC’s price has witnessed a notable increase in recent days, nearly touching the $48,000 mark on Friday. It is noteworthy to highlight that CryptoQuant’s analysis diverges from a recent report by Bitfinex, which attributed the recent decline in BTC’s price to a selling spree among Bitcoin miners. Bitfinex suggested that miners are divesting their BTC reserves to secure capital and upgrade infrastructure in anticipation of the forthcoming Bitcoin halving event.

2024-02-10 11:42:18+00:00,Bitcoin Open Interest Surges to Highest Level Since 2022: Implications for Price Ahead,https://dailycoinpost.com/bitcoin-open-interest-surges-to-highest-level-since-2022-implications-for-price-ahead/,"The recent resurgence of Bitcoin’s price to levels reminiscent of the beginning of the year has been accompanied by notable growth in the coin’s open interest. This metric, which reflects the amount of capital invested in Bitcoin derivatives, often serves as a harbinger for the future trajectory of Bitcoin’s price. As per the latest on-chain data, Bitcoin’s open interest has experienced a rapid ascent across various exchanges in tandem with the recent price surge. Data from CryptoQuant indicates that the open interest has surpassed $11.68 billion as of February 9th, representing its highest level since May 2022, coinciding with the collapse of the Terra Luna ecosystem. A pseudonymous analyst, in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, provided insights into this surge in open interest and its potential implications for Bitcoin’s price. While acknowledging that the uptick in open interest could indicate a short-term overheating, the analyst countered this notion by highlighting the current funding rate. The funding rate, a periodic payment between long and short traders to maintain the perpetual contract price close to the spot price of Bitcoin, plays a crucial role in assessing market sentiment. Despite the positive funding rate indicating long traders paying shorts, the analyst argued that it does not suggest significant overheating. This sentiment echoes a balanced market scenario akin to the steady rally observed in October-November 2023. Nevertheless, the analyst cautioned against a sudden spike in the Bitcoin funding rate, particularly to levels as high as 0.05, as it could trigger a long squeeze. This phenomenon, characterized by long traders liquidating their positions to mitigate losses, typically leads to a rapid decline in the asset’s price. In essence, the surge in open interest represents a favorable development for Bitcoin’s price, especially considering historical trends indicating a correlation between Bitcoin’s value and its open interest. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price hovers slightly above $47,200, reflecting a 4% increase over the past day.  Bitcoin Maximalist and Toxic to our banking and monetary system.

This upward momentum can be attributed to a consistent influx of cash into US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold the digital currency. In the past nine consecutive trading sessions, these ETFs have seen steady inflows, outpacing outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. On Friday, Bitcoin rose by as much as 3%, reaching $46,7000. The resurgence in interest comes after a period of initial hesitation fueled by outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, this shift in sentiment has been evident since the inception of ETF trading on January 12. JUST IN: #Bitcoin ETF inflows have been bigger than Grayscale’s outflows for 9 days in a row. pic.twitter.com/CinWkhXoA2 — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) February 9, 2024  Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets, a digital-asset derivatives liquidity provider, commented on the situation, noting that Bitcoin’s upward trajectory is likely to continue as Grayscale outflows stabilize. Mauron also pointed out the increasing significance of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, scheduled for April. This event, which occurs every four years, involves a reduction in the rewards given to miners for validating transactions, effectively halving the rate of Bitcoin production. This process is instrumental in maintaining the predetermined limit of 21 million tokens in circulation, with rewards decreasing from 6.25 to 3.125 coins per block. The anticipation surrounding the Bitcoin halving, combined with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 10, has fueled significant interest in digital assets. This enthusiasm has been reflected in Bitcoin’s impressive performance, with the cryptocurrency recording a remarkable 160% increase in value throughout 2023, outperforming traditional assets like gold and stocks. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC has paved the way for various issuers to introduce these investment vehicles, offering investors new avenues to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market. As Bitcoin continues to gain traction and investor confidence, it is poised to surpass the psychologically significant $50,000 mark in the near future.

PlanB’s Analysis,https://dailycoinpost.com/bitcoin-btc-price-will-never-drop-below-40k-again-planbs-analysis/,"Can Bitcoin (BTC) really maintain its sky-high prices, or are we being led into a speculative frenzy? PlanB, notorious for his Stock-to-Flow model, is stirring the pot with his latest claim that the asset will never dip below $40,000 again due to its realized price. But can we trust this bold assertion? Never Again Below $40K? Bitcoin’s ride since the year’s inception has been nothing short of a rollercoaster, thanks to the much-hyped ETF approvals in the United States. The launch of these products, touted as a game-changer, turned out to be nothing more than a sell-the-news event, causing BTC’s value to plummet by a whopping ten grand within weeks of hitting the US markets. Realized prices are all increasing, and bitcoin is above them all = bullish. Also, 5M realized price (currently $40k) acts like a floor for the dips in bull markets (red arrows). So .. never below $40k again?More info here: https://t.co/r5jEOGC3QS pic.twitter.com/aemAq8Q3C8 — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) February 8, 2024   However, just when despair seemed to loom, the asset miraculously rebounded, erasing almost all losses and soaring to nearly $45,000 today. But hold your horses, says PlanB. According to him, the recent retreat to sub-$40,000 levels caught many off guard and might not repeat itself. This optimistic outlook is based on Bitcoin’s realized prices across various timeframes. PlanB points out that while the overall BTC realized price sits comfortably at $23,000, the 2-year and 5-month realized prices stand at $32,000 and $40,000, respectively. With BTC’s current market price hovering around $45,000, PlanB interprets this as an extremely bullish sign, boldly speculating that Bitcoin may never dip below $40,000 again. Controversial Price Predictions Amidst the fervor surrounding ETF approvals and the looming fourth halving, predictions about BTC’s future price trajectory are running wild. A recent study by Bitget boldly forecasts a staggering $150,000 price tag for Bitcoin in the near future, more than doubling its previous all-time high of $69,000. Joining the chorus of optimistic voices is none other than Robert Kiyosaki, author of the Rich Dad Poor Dad bestseller, who echoes a similar sentiment. But wait, there’s more. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee throws his hat into the ring, predicting BTC’s price to surge anywhere between $100,000 and $150,000 this year alone, with an eye-watering leap to $500,000 by the decade’s end. As the debate rages on, one thing is for certain: the cryptocurrency world is as volatile as ever, and bold assertions like PlanB’s are sure to stoke controversy among both skeptics and believers alike.

2024-02-08 09:57:47+00:00,Cryptocurrency Analyst Forecasts Impending Bitcoin “Supply Shocks” Post-April,https://dailycoinpost.com/cryptocurrency-analyst-forecasts-impending-bitcoin-supply-shocks-post-april/,"In a technical analysis of Bitcoin (BTC) trends, an expert in the field expresses optimism regarding the cryptocurrency, asserting the imminent occurrence of what he terms a “supply shock of all supply shocks” following the forthcoming reduction of miner rewards on the network, expected to take effect in approximately two months. The upcoming event, known as the Bitcoin halving, commands attention as it is hard-coded into the protocol to occur roughly every four years or after the completion of 240,000 blocks. This eventuality will entail a substantial decrease in the issuance of new coins, consequently rendering Bitcoin increasingly deflationary and potentially exerting upward pressure on its market valuation. Notably, this projection takes into account the anticipated surge in demand for Bitcoin throughout the year 2024. Presently, the Bitcoin network facilitates the release of 6.25 BTC approximately every 10 minutes, resulting in a daily mining output of 900 BTC. Following the halving, this issuance rate will diminish by half to 450 BTC per day. The abrupt contraction in available supply, particularly in light of recent developments such as the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in mid-January 2024, underscores the potential magnitude of the impending supply shock. Spot Bitcoin ETFs represent a financial instrument enabling investors to access Bitcoin’s value directly, bypassing the complexities associated with storing private keys, as custody responsibilities are assumed by regulated entities like Coinbase Custody. Since their introduction in January, these spot Bitcoin ETFs have collectively acquired over 160,000 BTC. Of particular significance is the pace at which these ETFs continue to accumulate Bitcoin, with the current daily inflow estimated at 5,800 BTC. Maintaining this influx post-halving could feasibly surpass the rate of newly minted coins, thereby precipitating what the analyst characterizes as an unparalleled supply shock, where demand significantly outstrips available supply, consequently propelling prices upwards. Additionally, attention is drawn to the increasing Bitcoin reserves held by spot Bitcoin ETF issuers, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, which are rapidly approaching the holdings of MicroStrategy, a prominent business intelligence firm known for its significant Bitcoin treasury holdings. Data from Bitcoin Treasuries indicates that MicroStrategy presently controls 190,000 BTC, having recently augmented its holdings by 850 BTC on February 6. In contrast, spot Bitcoin ETF issuers collectively acquired 4,189 BTC on the same day, while Grayscale, a prominent cryptocurrency investment firm, divested 3,427 BTC. As of February 6, BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise, and other issuers command a combined Bitcoin reserve totaling 659,401 BTC, a figure that continues to rise and now exceeds MicroStrategy’s holdings, albeit inclusive of assets held by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which is undergoing gradual liquidation.

The seizure, involving 50,000 bitcoins, was the culmination of an international collaboration between German authorities, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Reuters reports. The joint effort highlighted the effectiveness of global cooperation in combating cybercrime. The bitcoins, linked to a suspect, were successfully transferred to a wallet under the control of German law enforcement. This operation was initiated as part of an investigation into a German counterfeiting portal that operated until May 2013. The focus was on two individuals, a 40-year-old German and a 37-year-old Pole, both suspected of acquiring the bitcoins through illicit activities, including money laundering.

Well, let’s delve into the intricacies and provide a perspective backed by data, with a focus on the dynamics of weak hands versus strong hands. A significant contributor to the ongoing dip is the activity of Grayscale, the world’s largest Bitcoin fund, which is strategically offloading a portion of its BTC holdings to meet redemption requests from its investors. Now, before you hastily decide to part ways with your BTC holdings, let’s dissect why this is happening and why, in the grand scheme, it’s not a cause for alarm. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has been a stalwart fund since 2013, accumulating an impressive 600,000 BTC, securing its position as the second-largest Bitcoin holder globally, just after the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto. However, GBTC has encountered challenges lately, primarily due to the emergence of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US market. These ETFs closely track Bitcoin’s price and levy lower fees than GBTC, prompting a significant capital shift away from GBTC. To meet investor redemption requests, GBTC, guided by weak hands, is compelled to sell a portion of its Bitcoin holdings and transfer the proceeds to investors. Data from CryptoQuant reveals that since January 12, 2024, Grayscale, exhibiting weaker hands, has moved over 41,000 BTC, equivalent to more than $1.7 billion, to Coinbase Prime. This selling activity has contributed to the recent dip in Bitcoin’s price, which now hovers below $43,000 as of January 18, 2024. The outflows from GBTC, driven by weak hands, may persist for several more weeks as investors reallocate their portfolios in search of more favorable alternatives. Throughout this period, Bitcoin’s price may experience heightened volatility and downward pressure. However, once the dust settles, those with strong hands, who weathered the storm, may seize the opportunity to accumulate Bitcoin at discounted prices. In conclusion, exercise patience and avoid succumbing to panic during this transitional phase. Bitcoin remains a valuable asset with substantial potential for growth and innovation. Always keep in mind, this is a game played for the long term, where strong hands prevail! What is your opinion on the current situation, feel free you write your comments below?

With several key events on the horizon, the question everyone’s asking is: where will the price go? Buckle up, because we’re about to take a wild ride through the Bitcoin landscape of 2024, analyzing the major events and daring to make a prediction (or two) about its price trajectory. The biggest event of 2024 for Bitcoin is undoubtedly the halving, which is estimated to occur in April. This event happens roughly every four years and cuts the reward miners receive for processing transactions in half. Historically, halvings have led to significant price increases due to reduced supply and increased demand. With the next halving approaching, many analysts believe it could propel Bitcoin’s price to new heights. Some, like PlanB, a popular Bitcoin analyst, predict a staggering $524,000 by year’s end. Others, like Blockware Solutions, are more conservative, estimating a peak of $400,000. Beyond the halving, another bullish factor is the growing adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Morgan Stanley are now dipping their toes into the Bitcoin waters, seeing it as a potential hedge against inflation and a valuable addition to their portfolios. This influx of institutional capital could significantly boost demand and push the price upwards. Despite the positive catalysts, some potential storm clouds could disrupt Bitcoin’s smooth sailing in 2024. Predicting the future of Bitcoin is notoriously difficult, and 2024 will be no different. While the halving and institutional adoption offer enticing possibilities for significant price increases, potential headwinds like economic uncertainty and regulatory hurdles add a layer of complexity. Therefore, instead of a single, definitive prediction, here’s a range of possibilities for Bitcoin’s price in 2024: No matter which scenario unfolds, one thing is certain: 2024 will be a volatile year for Bitcoin. Buckle up, do your research, and most importantly, remember that Bitcoin is a high-risk asset. Invest only what you can afford to lose, and diversify your portfolio to weather the inevitable storms. The future of Bitcoin remains unwritten, but 2024 promises to be a pivotal chapter in its ongoing story. Bitcoin Maximalist and Toxic to our banking and monetary system.

The reported outflows, estimated at close to $1 billion, are believed to have triggered a notable downturn in the price of Bitcoin (BTC). According to a CoinDesk report, FTX’s involvement in the GBTC sell-off becomes apparent following the fund’s transition into a Bitcoin spot ETF, gaining approval from federal regulators. Privately reviewed data, coupled with insights from individuals familiar with the matter, suggests that FTX’s estate has divested itself of a staggering 22 million GBTC shares. An early November filing indicated that as of October 25, FTX held 22.3 million GBTC shares valued at $597 million. At present market prices, these shares would command a value of $798 million. Two factors have contributed to the surge in share value. Firstly, the rise in Bitcoin’s price from approximately $34,500 on October 25 to the current level of $40,000, reaching a peak of $49,000 earlier this month. Secondly, the approval and subsequent conversion of GBTC into a Bitcoin spot ETF have eliminated a longstanding discount between GBTC share values and the underlying Bitcoin holdings. In early 2023, GBTC faced a discount of over 40% against the BTC price. With this discount erased, major GBTC holders like FTX have been incentivized to capitalize on profits. On the first day of GBTC trading as a spot ETF, FTX’s share ownership value soared to $900 million. However, it’s important to note that FTX’s stake wasn’t necessarily sold for that entire amount. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart indicates that FTX’s selloff was less than $1 billion. Notably, Alameda Research, FTX’s sister trading firm, had previously filed a lawsuit against Grayscale, alleging exploitative management fees. Following the share sell-off, the lawsuit was dismissed. The decline of both FTX and Alameda in November 2022 marked Bitcoin’s lowest price in over three years, at $15,500. Subsequent positive developments, including ETF approvals and Grayscale’s legal victories, contributed to Bitcoin’s resurgence over the following year. Despite these initial successes, Grayscale has witnessed significant outflows, totaling almost $3 billion, with $590.4 million recorded on a recent Friday. On-chain data reveals Grayscale’s Bitcoin selloff, with thousands of BTC being transferred from the firm’s blockchain addresses to Coinbase daily.

2024-01-20 11:24:01+00:00,Understanding the Bitcoin Price Drop Post-ETF Approval,https://dailycoinpost.com/understanding-the-bitcoin-price-drop-post-etf-approval/,"The recent approval of Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) initially sparked widespread excitement, but the subsequent substantial collapse in Bitcoin prices left many puzzled. While the notion that the ETF approval was already factored into the market is a partial explanation, there are additional dynamics at play. The approval of several Bitcoin ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was hailed as a breakthrough, symbolizing the integration of crypto into traditional finance. Anticipation was high, with expectations that institutional capital flooding into the market would propel Bitcoin prices to new heights. Initially, this optimism seemed justified as Bitcoin’s value surged to approximately 49,000 dollars. However, the celebration was short-lived as the price plummeted dramatically to 41,369dollars within a 24-hour period, leaving the market in a state of indecision. Was the ETF launch a failure, or had potential investors already incorporated Bitcoin into their portfolios? The success of the ETFs, particularly the BlackRock-managed iBIT, indicated a positive response, with a record-breaking turnover of $4.6 billion on the first day of trading. Despite this success, skepticism from other asset managers, such as Vanguard, muddied the waters, highlighting concerns about cryptocurrency’s investment thesis and volatile nature. So, why did the Bitcoin price decline despite the evident demand for ETFs? The answer may lie in the adage “Buy the rumor, sell the news.” Traders who had purchased Bitcoin in anticipation of ETF approval may have closed their positions once the news became official. This led to a cascading effect of selling, eroding the price gains made during the rumor-fueled rally. However, another significant factor often overlooked is the “Grayscale effect.” The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), with the highest trading volume, differed from other ETFs. GBTC shares were essentially a recycled product, backed by real Bitcoins but tradable only on the secondary market. The approval of ETFs allowed Grayscale to convert its fund into an ETF, facilitating primary market trading. On the first day of ETF approval, nearly $2.3 billion worth of GBTC shares changed hands. Importantly, these were existing shares rather than new securities based on recently purchased Bitcoins. This “Grayscale effect” introduced a flood of 600,000 Bitcoin-backed ETF shares onto the primary market, often traded profitably below market value. Unlike the “Buy the rumor, sell the news” scenario, the Grayscale effect relies on tangible economic mechanisms and could dominate the ETF landscape for some time. However, its influence is expected to diminish over the coming months as the market adjusts to this new dynamic. In essence, while anticipation played a role in the price drop, the Grayscale effect brought a more concrete element to the decline, contributing to a complex interplay of factors in the post-ETF approval Bitcoin market.

2024-01-04 12:05:29+00:00,Why Daily Coin Post Asserts the SEC’s Rejection of Bitcoin Spot ETFs,https://dailycoinpost.com/why-daily-coin-post-asserts-the-secs-rejection-of-bitcoin-spot-etfs/,"Executive Summary Daily Coin Post, renowned for its prescient forecasts, defied consensus expectations throughout 2023 by boldly predicting that Bitcoin would surge to $45,000 by Christmas. Anticipating a potential rally to $50,000 by the end of January 2024 if all SEC requirements for Bitcoin Spot ETFs were met, Daily Coin Post closely monitored the frequent meetings between ETF applicants and SEC staff. Despite applicants refiling their submissions, Daily Coin Post maintains that a crucial requirement remains unfulfilled, predicting the SEC’s rejection in January 2024, with potential fulfillment by Q2 2024. The pivotal leadership of the SEC’s five-person voting Commissioners, currently dominated by Democrats, plays a decisive role in ETF approval. SEC Chair Gensler, displaying a cautious stance towards crypto, casts doubt on the likelihood of approving Bitcoin Spot ETFs. Despite the potential for an ETF to catalyze crypto’s ascent, Gensler’s reservations, expressed in December 2023, suggest a preference for more stringent compliance and reluctance to legitimize Bitcoin as an alternative store of value. Since traders began anticipating an ETF approval in September 2023, an influx of at least $14 billion in fiat and leverage has flowed into crypto, with $10 billion attributed to ETF approval expectations. The prospect of SEC denial could trigger cascading liquidations, unwinding the $5.1 billion in additional perpetual long Bitcoin futures and potentially causing a rapid -20% decline, reverting to the $36,000/$38,000 range. In such a scenario, envisioning a 20% red candle on the Bitcoin price chart becomes a plausible outcome. The ensuing panic among traders and investors attempting to mitigate potential losses could result in a significant market downturn. In the absence of any approvals by Friday, January 5, 2024, Daily Coin Post recommends that traders hedge their long exposure by acquiring $40,000 strike puts for the end of January or consider outright short positions in Bitcoin through options. Even if the SEC denies the ETF, Daily Coin Post maintains its expectation of higher Bitcoin prices by the end of 2024 compared to the year’s beginning ($42,000). Citing the positive trends during US election years and Bitcoin mining cycles, Daily Coin Post remains optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s long-term trajectory.

2023-12-09 11:55:18+00:00,What Would Happen if 10 Billionaires Put $1 Billion in Bitcoin Each,https://dailycoinpost.com/what-would-happen-if-10-billionaires-put-1-billion-in-bitcoin-each/,"In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, where fortunes can be made and lost in the blink of an eye, the impact of influential players on the market is a topic of perpetual fascination. Recently, a curious scenario has been pondered: What if a mere ten billionaires decided to invest a staggering $1 billion each in Bitcoin? Could such a move truly wield enough power to send shockwaves through the entire market? According to reports from the Bank of America, the cost of shifting Bitcoin’s price by a modest 1% is a relatively modest $93 million. Armed with this intriguing tidbit, let’s explore the potential repercussions of 10 billionaires entering the Bitcoin arena with a billion-dollar investment each. To set the stage, it’s crucial to grasp the current landscape. The total market capitalization of Bitcoin, the kingpin of cryptocurrencies, stands at an impressive $857 billion. Now, envision a scenario where these ten high-profile individuals inject their colossal wealth into the market. Firstly, multiplying the number of Bitcoins in circulation, which is approximately 19.56 million, by the cost to move the price by 1% ($93 million) yields a staggering total of $1.18 trillion. This figure represents the potential market cap increase resulting from the billionaire cohort’s investments. Against this backdrop, the current market cap of $857 billion seems almost modest. Combining this existing figure with the prospective market cap growth triggered by the billionaires’ influx, we arrive at a grand total of $2.04 trillion. This hypothetical sum reflects the new valuation of the entire Bitcoin market. In a world where numbers often speak louder than words, the next logical step is to calculate the impact on the price per Bitcoin. Dividing the newly minted total market cap ($2.04 trillion) by the total number of Bitcoins in circulation (19.56 million) provides a fascinating insight: $104,000 per Bitcoin. What happens if only 10 billionaires buys #bitcoin for $1B each? 118x$10B = $1.18T.
Current market cap is $857B. ($1.18T + $857B) / 19.56M coins
= $104k per BTC. — Bitcoin for Freedom (@BTC_for_Freedom) December 8, 2023  Such a revelation prompts contemplation on the sheer potential for market disruption held by a handful of individuals. It underscores the delicate balance between the colossal influence of major players and the intricate dynamics of the cryptocurrency realm. The mere prospect of a few billionaires steering the market toward a six-figure valuation per Bitcoin adds yet another layer of intrigue to the evolving narrative of digital currencies. Nevertheless, it is essential to approach such predictions with caution. The cryptocurrency landscape is notorious for its volatility, with a myriad of factors influencing market movements. While the $104,000 per Bitcoin scenario paints a compelling picture, the reality may unfold in ways that elude even the most astute observers. In the end, the tantalizing prospect of 10 billionaires reshaping the fate of Bitcoin serves as a testament to the fluidity and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market. As the digital financial frontier continues to evolve, only time will reveal the true impact of such influential maneuvers on the ever-shifting canvas of cryptocurrencies.

2023-12-01 09:03:42+00:00,Bitcoin Transaction Fees Surpass Ethereum Transaction Fees,https://dailycoinpost.com/bitcoin-transaction-fees-surpass-ethereum-transaction-fees/,"Bitcoin’s transaction fees have surpassed those of Ethereum for the first time in years, marking a significant shift in the ongoing competition between the two cryptocurrencies. Historically, Ethereum’s block producers had consistently outpaced Bitcoin miners in collecting transaction fees, owing to Ethereum’s broader range of applications beyond simple transactions. However, recent data from  Blockchain.com reveals that in the last seven days, Bitcoin transaction fees have exceeded Ethereum’s. This comes as a notable departure from the trend observed since around 2020, where Ethereum consistently outperformed Bitcoin in fee collection.  Source: Blockchain.com Throughout November, Bitcoin’s transaction fees have seen a substantial increase, with miners accumulating between two and twelve million dollars in fees daily. This surge contrasts sharply with the previous months, where fees ranged from 300,000 to 1.2 million dollars. The growth in Bitcoin transactions is remarkable, with fee income rising from 16-50 Bitcoin between July and November to 30-317 Bitcoin. The upcoming fourth halving, expected to reduce the reward to 3,125 Bitcoins, poses a challenge to miners. However, the record-setting days in November contribute significantly to mitigating potential security losses during the halving. For Bitcoin users, the noticeable increase in transaction fees poses challenges. While fees were around two dollars in the fall, they have now exceeded five dollars on most days in November, reaching over 20 dollars on peak days. This development benefits miners and network security but presents a less favorable scenario for regular users. In contrast, Ethereum’s fee landscape has evolved differently. Following a substantial spike in fees from 2020 to spring 2022, Ethereum fees have steadily decreased to a minimum of 300, a maximum of 1000, and typically 500-600 Ether in November. This translates to $1-1.2 million on normal days. The November anomaly, where Bitcoin surpassed Ethereum in fee income, is notable. Ethereum’s activity has expanded into various Layer 2s over the years, with only 15-30 percent of daily transactions occurring on the main chain. The surge in Bitcoin fees can be attributed to the Ordinals protocol, which facilitates the inclusion of NFTs and fungible tokens on the blockchain. Despite the initial hype calming in early summer, Ordinals fees skyrocketed in November, contributing more than 20 Bitcoin in fees on most days and even reaching 122 to 133 on outliers. The Ordinals’ strong demand has become a key driver of Bitcoin fees, with notable increases observed on November 16th and 18th. The reasons behind the Ordinals resurgence are not entirely clear, but the dominance of “text” ordinals and the explosion of fees generated by BRC-20 tokens suggest a built-up ecosystem around these tokens, influencing miners to charge high fees and driving up transaction costs for all users.

2023-11-28 09:40:43+00:00,Terra’s Remarkable Rally: USTC Soars 370% as BTC Dips to $37K (Market Recap),https://dailycoinpost.com/terras-remarkable-rally-ustc-soars-370-as-btc-dips-to-37k-market-recap/,"In a surprising turn of events, Terra’s troubled stablecoin has witnessed a remarkable surge in triple digits today, outshining the broader crypto market. Bitcoin, which had its sights set on $38,000 just a day ago, faced a sudden setback, leading to a decline to $37,000 after encountering resistance. While most alternative coins are currently in the red, tokens associated with the Terra ecosystem are defying the trend with some experiencing nearly a 300% increase in their prices. BTC Facing Challenges at $37K Following a tumultuous business week marked by Bitcoin’s drop below $36,000 amid the Binance-DOJ settlement, the cryptocurrency rebounded, reaching an 18-month peak at $38,500. However, the bullish momentum was short-lived as bearish pressure emerged, pushing Bitcoin below the $38,000 threshold. The weekend saw Bitcoin stabilizing around $37,500, but it experienced a reversal, dipping to a 4-day low below $37,000. Despite the volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, currently maintaining a position a few hundred dollars above the $37,000 mark. Its dominance has slightly increased to 51.5%, though its market cap has experienced a dip, settling at $730 billion. While many major altcoins, including Ethereum, Binance Coin, Ripple, Cardano, Tron, Toncoin, Avalanche, and Polkadot, have retraced by up to 2%, Solana, Chainlink, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu have experienced declines ranging from 3-5%, with only minor increases for the latter two. Notably, the standout performers today hail from the Terra ecosystem. The previously beleaguered stablecoin, which faced a significant value loss a year and a half ago, has witnessed an astonishing 275% surge in the past day and a staggering 370% increase over the last week, now trading at $0.06. Terra Classic (LUNC) and Terra (LUNA) have also demonstrated impressive gains of 50% and 32%, respectively. The notable surge in Terra assets can be attributed to strategic investments aimed at stabilizing the ecosystem. Terra Classic Labs, for instance, injected $500,000 into USTC to stabilize its value and enhance liquidity, resulting in an impressive 76.6% increase in price. Furthermore, the collaboration between Terra and Binance, marked by initiatives such as token burn programs, seeks to restore stability to the Terra ecosystem. This collaborative effort has played a crucial role in the remarkable resurgence of Terra-related assets. Despite these positive developments, the overall cryptocurrency market has experienced an overnight setback, losing around $20 billion and settling at a total market cap of $1.420 trillion.

2023-11-27 21:22:09+00:00,F2Pool Controversy: Censorship Concerns Threaten Bitcoin’s Core Principles,https://dailycoinpost.com/f2pool-controversy-censorship-concerns-threaten-bitcoins-core-principles/,"The third-largest Bitcoin mining pool, F2Pool, has come under scrutiny for allegedly censoring transactions originating from an address sanctioned by the US Treasury Department. This marks a significant development, as it brings censorship concerns to the foundational layer of Bitcoin, challenging its core principle of resistance to censorship. The accusation surfaced when a Bitcoin developer known as 0xB10C, running the website “Miningpool.Observer,” detected missing transactions in F2Pool’s blocks. This developer utilized a method involving a list of “missing transactions” to simulate the next block using Bitcoin Core’s standard algorithm. By comparing simulated and actual blocks, any absent transactions could be identified. In September and October, 0xB10C observed instances where ViaBTC and Foundry ignored transactions from addresses listed on the US OFAC sanctions. While plausible explanations existed for these omissions, the situation with F2Pool raised more concerns. F2Pool allegedly omitted transactions attempting to spend Bitcoins from an address associated with a Chinese drug smuggler in multiple blocks, leading to the conclusion that the pool was filtering transactions. The F2Pool founder, Wang Chun, initially acknowledged the transaction filtering through a tweet but later deleted it. He then shifted blame from the pool to the system, advocating for the development of a censorship-resistant protocol. This incident raises questions about the potential transition from a censorship-resistant network to a censored one, particularly as major pools like Antpool and Foundry already verify the identity of their miners. The ethical dilemma arises as pools exercise their right to confirm or reject transactions. While some argue that refusing transactions from criminals is an ethical decision, others contend that Bitcoin’s resistance to censorship should take precedence as a greater good. As long as individual miners make these decisions, the impact is limited. However, a scenario of “hard” censorship, where pools actively reject blocks containing output from sanctioned addresses, is conceivable in the long term. In conclusion, the F2Pool incident has sparked concerns about the potential erosion of Bitcoin’s resistance to censorship at its foundational layer, emphasizing the need for ongoing vigilance within the crypto community.

2023-11-26 09:13:15+00:00,Bitcoin ETFs: Navigating the Impact on Price Amid Regulatory Waves,https://dailycoinpost.com/bitcoin-etfs-navigating-the-impact-on-price-amid-regulatory-waves/,"The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with speculation surrounding the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). As investors eagerly anticipate this development, the market finds itself at a crucial juncture, echoing the Wall Street adage, “Buy the rumor, sell the news.” This article delves into the historical context of similar market dynamics, the evolving landscape of Bitcoin acquisitions, the significance of Exchange Traded Funds, and the potential impact on Bitcoin prices. In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, historical patterns often provide valuable insights. The adage “Buy the rumor, sell the news” resonates strongly, as exemplified by two significant events in recent crypto history – the launch of CME futures and Coinbase’s public listing. In this article, Panteracapital, highlights the stark market shifts that followed these highly anticipated events, emphasizing the potential bear markets triggered on the very days of their realization.   Source: panteracapital.com The article contextualizes the evolution of Bitcoin acquisition methods over the past decade, ranging from the early days of Bitcoin faucets to the proliferation of diverse cryptocurrency exchanges. It then addresses the role of futures in Bitcoin trading, noting their limited impact compared to the inherent strengths of Bitcoin’s spot trading. Contrary to futures, ETFs are presented as a potential game-changer. The author predicts that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs could mark a significant step in the adoption of digital assets. The comparison to the launch of gold ETFs serves as a precedent, suggesting that the ease of access, low cost, and credibility associated with reputable sponsors could attract a wave of new investors to the Bitcoin market. Anticipating the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the article explores the potential positive impact on Bitcoin demand. Drawing parallels with historical gold ETF launches, the author suggests that these investment vehicles could permanently alter the demand function for Bitcoin. The expectation is that the entry of respected brands into the Bitcoin ETF space will not only legitimize Bitcoin as an investment but also attract a broader investor base. The article argues that the Bitcoin ETF landscape will likely be dominated by a few key players, drawing a parallel with the concentration observed in the gold ETF market. This concentration is seen as a positive factor, as larger ETFs tend to price more efficiently, creating a virtuous cycle that enhances their marketability. The article delves into the four-year cyclicality observed in Bitcoin’s price, driven by its supply and distribution rules. Past performance is analyzed to predict a potential rally until November 1, 2025. The symmetry of these cycles is presented as a remarkable phenomenon, leaving room for future anthropologists to ponder the alignment of these blocks without external influence. The narrative shifts to the regulatory landscape, celebrating Ripple’s legal victories as an example of positive black swans in the cryptocurrency space. The article emphasizes the impact of regulatory clarity on the industry, positioning it as a crucial factor contributing to the positive trajectory of specific projects. The article briefly touches on the rapid downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX, drawing parallels with high-profile legal cases in other industries. This segment adds a cautionary note to the excitement surrounding the crypto space, underscoring the importance of regulatory compliance and ethical conduct. Addressing Charlie Munger’s criticism of Bitcoin as an artificial currency, the article presents a counterargument. It questions the logic behind Munger’s preference for traditional forms of currency, such as seashells or corn kernels, over Bitcoin. The article defends Bitcoin as a revolutionary financial technology and challenges the notion that sovereign-issued currencies have universally benefited the masses. As the crypto market eagerly awaits the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, historical patterns, regulatory developments, and legal victories offer valuable insights into the potential impact on Bitcoin prices. The article emphasizes the transformative potential of ETFs in reshaping Bitcoin demand and highlights the importance of reputable brands and regulatory clarity in fostering a positive market environment. It remains to be seen if history will repeat itself and if the ETF launch day will mark the peak of this bull market. Bitcoin Maximalist and Toxic to our banking and monetary system.

2023-11-25 12:41:28+00:00,Dollar Slips as U.S. Rates Plateau: Economic Indicators and Global Markets Recap,https://dailycoinpost.com/dollar-slips-as-u-s-rates-plateau-economic-indicators-and-global-markets-recap/,"The dollar went down compared to other currencies because it seems that interest rates in the United States have stopped going up. This happened after reports showed that U.S. businesses were doing okay in November, but there was a decrease in private sector jobs, as expected for a slowdown in the economy at the end of the year. Not much trading happened because U.S. markets closed early due to the Thanksgiving holiday. A market analyst in London said it’s very quiet, and the market is probably taking the easiest route. A report by S&P Global said that the U.S. business activity didn’t change much in November, but there was a small increase in services, while manufacturing decreased. When this index is above 50, it means the private sector is growing. However, because there wasn’t much growth in orders, businesses had to let some workers go. This is seen as helpful for the Federal Reserve’s efforts to control inflation. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against others, went down a bit to 103.35, close to the lowest point in 2 and a half months. This is the weakest performance in a year, as people think the Federal Reserve might not raise interest rates anymore and might even lower them next year. In Japan, the yen stayed steady against the dollar after news that Japan’s prices went up a bit in October. This makes investors think that the Bank of Japan might reduce its support soon. Economists predict that the Bank of Japan might change its policy next year, especially if Japanese government bonds stabilize. They think the bank might stop a program related to interest rates in the first quarter of the year and might increase rates in 2024. In Europe, the euro went up a bit against the dollar after confirming that Germany’s economy shrank a little in the third quarter. However, German business confidence improved in November. The euro had gained earlier in the week because preliminary data suggested that Germany might not go into a deep recession. The British pound increased after reports showed that British companies were growing in November, raising hopes that Britain might avoid a recession. In the world of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin went up to $38,415, its highest since April 2022. The market has been revived by new interest, including from traditional finance companies, to trade bitcoin and other digital currencies.

Over the past three months, Bitcoin has staged an impressive rally, breaking free from the $26,000 to $28,000 range. Interestingly, the cryptocurrency flirted with the $38,000 level twice this month before decisively surging beyond it today, settling at approximately $38,300. Notably, other cryptocurrencies are also experiencing positive price movements today, with Ether registering a 3.5% increase, Cardano up by 3.4%, and Dogecoin showing a 3.5% uptick. Ether, in particular, has witnessed a substantial 10% rise over the past week. The recent surge in Bitcoin’s price coincides with notable developments in the realm of spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Grayscale Investments engaged in discussions with officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission’s division of trading and markets on Monday, focusing on potential listing considerations for their product’s shares. Grayscale is actively pursuing the transformation of its flagship Bitcoin trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF, as evidenced by an updated prospectus filed post-meeting. Similarly, a memorandum dated Nov. 20 revealed that the SEC held talks with representatives from BlackRock and Nasdaq, indicating a broader dialogue within the industry.

2023-11-23 10:17:01+00:00,Crypto Enthusiasts: The Heroes We Didn’t Know We Needed,https://dailycoinpost.com/crypto-enthusiasts-the-heroes-we-didnt-know-we-needed/,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, I found an  article about a study that claims to have uncovered a dark side to cryptocurrency enthusiasts, associating them with traits from the ominous-sounding “dark tetrad” – a combination of Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and sadism. This revelation, although intriguing, raises questions about the inherent biases and potentially one-sided perspective of the study. Let’s embark on a more extensive exploration of these claims, to unravel the mystery behind the so-called “dark” personalities driving crypto enthusiasm. The article we are talking about is titled:  ‘Impulsive psychopaths like crypto’: research shows how ‘dark’ personality traits affect Bitcoin enthusiasm.   Dark tetrad personality traits that shape crypto enthusiasts personality according to theconversation.com study The study suggests that Machiavellians are drawn to cryptocurrency due to their inherent distrust of politicians and government agencies. But is skepticism towards entities known for corruption truly a negative trait? Perhaps, in the crypto world, Machiavellians are the trailblazers ushering in a new era of financial transparency and autonomy. After all, distrusting the traditional power structures may just be a sign of forward-thinking independence. Expanding on this, one could argue that Machiavellians are not merely skeptics; they are savvy strategists navigating a landscape fraught with uncertainty. Their calculated approach to achieving goals might just be the type of mindset needed to navigate the complex world of cryptocurrency successfully. Could it be that these individuals are not impulsive risk-takers but rather methodical thinkers carefully weighing the risks and rewards of this decentralized frontier? The study posits that narcissists are more likely to invest in cryptocurrency due to their positive outlook on life. But let’s ponder for a moment: is having confidence in the future and believing in personal improvement a negative trait? In a space as volatile as cryptocurrency, a healthy dose of optimism might just be the driving force needed to weather the storms of market fluctuations. Could it be that narcissists bring a much-needed positive energy to the crypto world, propelling innovation and growth? After all, the journey of a cryptocurrency investor is often filled with highs and lows, and a steadfast belief in personal success might be the very fuel that keeps them going. The study argues that impulsive psychopaths are attracted to cryptocurrency due to their fear of missing out on potential rewards. However, what if their impulsivity is not a reckless abandonment of reason but rather a calculated risk-taking approach? In the dynamic and fast-paced realm of cryptocurrency markets, one could argue that it takes a certain level of calculated impulsivity to seize opportunities and navigate the ever-changing landscape. Perhaps, instead of viewing psychopathic traits as a hindrance, we should recognize them as attributes that enable individuals to thrive in an environment where adaptability and quick decision-making are paramount. Could it be that these impulsive psychopaths are not driven by irrational fear but rather by a keen awareness of the potential rewards awaiting those who dare to venture into the crypto space? The study suggests that sadists are drawn to cryptocurrency to revel in the potential suffering of others. However, this assertion seems to stretch the limits of credibility. Could it be that these so-called sadists are simply individuals who don’t want to miss out on the financial gains that others are experiencing? In the pursuit of financial success, the fear of missing out (FOMO) is a universal experience, not exclusive to those with a sadistic streak. Perhaps, instead of attributing sinister motives to crypto enthusiasts, we should acknowledge that the desire to partake in the financial benefits of the crypto boom is a shared sentiment, driven by a mix of curiosity, opportunity, and yes, perhaps a bit of FOMO. Final words: While the study attempts to correlate cryptocurrency enthusiasts with the “dark tetrad” personality traits, it is essential to remember that motivations for entering the crypto space are diverse and multifaceted. Before casting a shadow over an entire community based on psychological traits, let’s appreciate the complexity and innovation that the crypto world brings. The heroes of this narrative may have traits that the study deems “dark,” but in the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrency, every hero is bound to have a touch of complexity.

2023-11-21 11:04:45+00:00,Bitcoin Revolution: Argentina’s Paradigm Shift Under President Javier Milei,https://dailycoinpost.com/bitcoin-revolution-argentinas-paradigm-shift-under-president-javier-milei/,"In a surprising turn of events, Argentina has elected Javier Milei, a staunch Bitcoin advocate and economist of the Austrian school, as its new president. The nation, grappling with economic challenges and a desire for change, seems poised for a radical transformation under Milei’s leadership. This shift not only involves a potential move towards the adoption of Bitcoin but also the abolition of the central bank and a push toward dollarization in Argentina. The winds of change blowing across Argentina mirror the recent developments in El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele successfully implemented Bitcoin as legal tender. In a parallel move, Milei’s commitment to Bitcoin and his anarcho-capitalist ideology suggest that Argentina may be on the cusp of a groundbreaking experiment in economic policy. The implications of such a move on Bitcoin’s price are both intriguing and significant. The Austrian school of economics, to which Milei adheres, emphasizes the importance of individual liberty, free markets, and sound money. In Milei’s case, this translates into a fervent belief in Bitcoin as a decentralized and inflation-resistant alternative to traditional fiat currencies. The abolition of Argentina’s central bank and the potential shift toward dollarization signal a departure from the conventional economic models that have defined the nation’s history. This transition aligns with the Austrian school’s criticism of central banking and the inherent risks of fiat currencies. The implications of such a move on Bitcoin’s price are both intriguing and significant. To analyze this, we turn to the unique perspective of Peter St Onge, an economist known for his insights into the intersection of libertarian principles and financial markets. Milei wins in Argentina! Jubilation in the streets as Argentina elects it’s first libertarian President, the Trump-admiring, lion-maned rocker Javier Milei. He wants to abolish the central bank, crack down on rampant crime, and slash 60% of the “parasitic, corrupt and useless”… pic.twitter.com/MdYMhTts53 — Peter St Onge, Ph.D. (@profstonge) November 21, 2023  As Milei assumes the presidency and the nation takes steps toward embracing Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency’s adoption could skyrocket. Argentina’s large GDP (487.2 billion USD 2021 according to World Bank), coupled with Milei’s commitment to Bitcoin, might attract global attention and investment. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and resistance to inflation make it an appealing choice for a country seeking economic stability. If Milei’s policies gain traction, Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against currency devaluation, leading to increased demand and, consequently, a potential uptick in its price. The Salvadoran model, where Bitcoin became legal tender, provides a glimpse into the potential outcomes for Argentina. El Salvador’s move initially led to increased adoption and a surge in Bitcoin transactions. However, challenges and resistance arose, highlighting the complexities of integrating a decentralized currency into a traditional financial system. Argentina’s path may follow a similar trajectory, with initial enthusiasm potentially met by challenges from within the country and the global financial community. Nevertheless, if Milei’s vision prevails, Bitcoin could solidify its role as a key player in the nation’s economic landscape. The global repercussions of a major economy like Argentina adopting Bitcoin cannot be underestimated. As news of Argentina’s embrace of Bitcoin spreads, it may fuel a broader trend of nations exploring decentralized alternatives to traditional currencies. Investors, seeking to diversify their portfolios and hedge against economic uncertainties, might flock to Bitcoin. The increased demand could contribute to a sustained uptrend in the cryptocurrency’s price, mirroring the impact of institutional adoption seen in recent years. Argentina’s pivot toward Bitcoin under President Milei’s leadership marks a bold step into uncharted territory. The interplay of Austrian economics, anarcho-capitalist ideals, and the potential for Bitcoin adoption creates a unique narrative that captures the imagination of libertarians and crypto enthusiasts alike. As the world watches Argentina navigate these uncharted waters, the potential impact on Bitcoin’s price remains uncertain yet intriguing. If Milei’s vision materializes, we may witness a paradigm shift, with Bitcoin emerging not only as a store of value but as a catalyst for economic transformation on a national scale.

The nation eagerly anticipates the positive changes that Milei, a proponent of Bitcoin, will bring as he assumes office on December 10.  Late on a Sunday night, according to Bloomberg, the official confirmation of Milei’s victory marked a turning point for Argentina. While he has not explicitly called for Bitcoin to become legal tender or a reserve asset, Milei has put forth plans to replace the struggling Argentine peso with the more stable US dollar. The urgency for change became evident as the Argentine peso experienced hyperinflation, soaring to a staggering 143% just the previous Monday, leaving the country in dire financial straits. Earlier this year, the citizens of Argentina passionately rallied in support of Bitcoin, forming a massive BTC symbol to voice their discontent with the rampant inflation plaguing their nation. Second Bitcoin President. Congratulations to @JMilei on his landslide victory in Argentina. pic.twitter.com/CNOqFbb5Q8 — Balaji (@balajis) November 20, 2023 
A vocal critic of central banking, Milei has not minced words in expressing his disdain for what he sees as a deceptive mechanism. He boldly declared, “The central bank is a scam, a mechanism by which politicians cheat the good people with inflationary tax.” His views on Bitcoin are equally affirmative, describing it as “the return of money to its original creator, the private sector,” and highlighting its role in preventing politicians from exploiting the public through inflation. In a symbolic act, Milei once appeared on a TV show, vigorously beating a piñata shaped like a central bank with a stick, underscoring his commitment to challenging traditional financial systems. While the future of Bitcoin in Argentina may seem uncertain, Milei’s inauguration is viewed optimistically as a potential precursor to the country following in the footsteps of El Salvador, officially adopting Bitcoin as legal tender and incorporating it into its reserve assets. The prospect of a Bitcoin-friendly leader in Argentina offers hope for a brighter and more innovative financial future for the nation. Immediately after the election results, the Bitcoin price surged by more than $1000 hitting $37,500. Was this as a result of the elections in Argentina?

2023-11-19 14:37:14+00:00,Bitcoin’s Pre-Bull Market and the Shifting Dominance Dynamics,https://dailycoinpost.com/bitcoins-pre-bull-market-and-the-shifting-dominance-dynamics/,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors and enthusiasts alike are closely observing Bitcoin’s price action in November, which many believe is a pre-bull market phase. The anticipation is palpable, with a potential full-blown bull market looming, especially considering the impact of the halving and the potential catalyst of ETF approval. Bitcoin, often referred to as digital gold, has historically exhibited cyclical behavior marked by bull and bear markets. At present, the market sentiment suggests that Bitcoin is in a pre-bull phase, indicated by a yellow flag for investors. This pre-bull market condition is crucial, as it sets the stage for what could be a significant upward movement in the cryptocurrency’s value. IMO bitcoin is currently in pre-bull market (yellow) and on track towards a full blown bull market (red, after halving unless earlier ETF approval). Note I changed colors and stage names again, to better align with S2F model:
🟡pre-bull
🔴bull market
🔵pre-bear
🟢bear market pic.twitter.com/tmayjteVWv — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) November 19, 2023  The halving, a programmed event that occurs approximately every four years, is a fundamental aspect of Bitcoin’s design. It involves a reduction in the reward that miners receive for validating transactions, effectively slowing down the creation of new Bitcoins. Historically, halvings have been associated with bull markets, as the reduced supply often coincides with increased demand, driving up the price. Another factor adding to the excitement is the possibility of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval. An ETF could provide institutional investors with a regulated and accessible way to enter the cryptocurrency market, potentially bringing a surge of capital and mainstream acceptance. If approved, this could expedite Bitcoin’s journey into a full-blown bull market. One noteworthy trend is the dropping dominance of Bitcoin within the overall cryptocurrency market. Traditionally, Bitcoin has held a dominant position, often comprising the majority of the total market capitalization. However, current conditions suggest a shift in dynamics as Bitcoin’s dominance wanes, making space for the rise of alternative cryptocurrencies (alts) and microcaps. #Bitcoin – Dominance dropping as expected. Ideal conditions would be a slow $BTC bleed/chop as alts and microcaps take off. Then in 2024 we re-set and send $BTC higher and repeat with a proper cycle pic.twitter.com/J3a5A0K3gq — IncomeSharks (@IncomeSharks) November 17, 2023 
The ideal scenario for many investors is a slow bleed or chop in Bitcoin’s value, allowing altcoins and microcaps to flourish. This diversification and growth in other segments of the market can contribute to a healthier overall ecosystem. This trend may signify a broader acceptance and adoption of blockchain technology beyond Bitcoin. The expectation is that 2024 will bring about a reset in the market dynamics. Bitcoin may regain its dominance, leading to renewed upward momentum. This cyclicality is a characteristic feature of the cryptocurrency market, with periods of consolidation followed by explosive growth. As we witness the pre-bull market conditions, the impact of halving, and the potential ETF approval, the enthusiasm  is growing in the crypto market and new capital is flowing into the crypto markets. A market that after flushing the bad actors is setting the stage for a reset and repeat cycle that could define the cryptocurrency landscape in the coming years.

At the core of this revolutionary digital currency is the Bitcoin whitepaper, a seminal document penned by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. As a tribute to this groundbreaking piece of literature, the Bitcoin whitepaper poster has emerged as a symbol of the crypto revolution, capturing the essence of decentralization, transparency, and financial sovereignty. The Bitcoin whitepaper, titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” was published by Nakamoto in October 2008. This nine-page document laid the foundation for the creation of Bitcoin and introduced the concept of a decentralized digital currency, operating on a peer-to-peer network without the need for intermediaries like banks or governments. The whitepaper outlined the mechanics of the blockchain, the distributed ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions. It proposed a consensus algorithm called Proof-of-Work to secure the network and prevent double-spending. Nakamoto’s vision was to create a currency that could operate independently of traditional financial institutions, offering a borderless, censorship-resistant form of money. In homage to the historical significance of Nakamoto’s whitepaper, artists and crypto enthusiasts have embraced the creation of Bitcoin whitepaper posters. These posters serve as tangible reminders of the ideals and principles that underpin the world of cryptocurrency. The design of these posters varies, with some featuring the entire text of the whitepaper in a visually appealing format, while others focus on key excerpts and illustrations. Many posters incorporate the iconic Bitcoin logo and blockchain imagery, reinforcing the connection between the digital and physical aspects of the crypto world. The Bitcoin whitepaper poster has become more than just a piece of artwork; it symbolizes the ideals and principles that drive the cryptocurrency community. Here are some key aspects of its symbolism: The Bitcoin whitepaper poster stands as a visual representation of the transformative power of cryptocurrency. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, it serves to remind us of the ideals embedded in Nakamoto’s vision — a vision that has sparked a global movement towards financial inclusion, transparency, and decentralized innovation. As the crypto space continues to evolve, the Bitcoin whitepaper poster remains a timeless artifact, preserving the spirit of a revolution that began with the stroke of a pen in 2008.  Download the Whitepaper Poster Bitcoin Maximalist and Toxic to our banking and monetary system.

Over the last 12 months, the bitcoin price has more than doubled, thrusting bitcoin and cryptocurrencies back into the spotlight. This resurgence persists despite concerns that the U.S. government and BlackRock’s potential bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) could pose a threat to bitcoin’s viability. Presently, with the crypto community closely monitoring a potential breakthrough with BlackRock, a prominent ETF analyst asserts that leaked conversations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicate ongoing negotiations with crypto exchanges regarding ETF applications. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, shared insights on Twitter, stating, “Hearing chatter SEC’s Trading and Markets engaged with exchanges this week on spot bitcoin ETF 19b-4s, is advising them they’d like the ETFs to do cash creates (vs in-kind), and has asked them to get in amendments in next couple weeks.” Balchunas emphasizes that while this development was anticipated, it remains a positive sign. The distinction between cash and in-kind refers to the method of redemptions, with in-kind funds providing investors leaving the fund with a payment other than cash. Providing an update on the situation, James Seyffart, another Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst, commented on Balchunas’ post, affirming that it does not alter their 90% likelihood prediction of a bitcoin spot ETF gaining approval this year. Seyffart notes that while it may not be groundbreaking, progress is evident and things are advancing. However, Gabor Gurbacs, founder of the rewards app PointsVille and an advisor to investment manager VanEck, expressed caution, interpreting the SEC’s preference for cash bitcoin spot ETFs as a “sign that regulators don’t [or are]unwilling to understand and accept the best aspects of ETFs and bitcoin. In-kind creates are simply much more efficient. Anyone managing an ETF knows this,” as posted on Twitter. Balchunas’ disclosure spurred a rapid surge in the bitcoin price, escalating from $36,000 per bitcoin to nearly $37,000. This reaction suggests that traders are responding to indications that the SEC may be on the verge of approving bitcoin spot ETF applications from prominent Wall Street entities managing a combined $17.7 trillion, as a closely-monitored “window” comes to a close. In June, the bitcoin price experienced a significant boost after BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager overseeing approximately $10 trillion for clients, submitted an application to create a bitcoin spot ETF with Coinbase serving as its custodian.

This proactive approach from the regulatory body signals a progressive shift in the landscape, paving the way for a potential altseason that enthusiasts have been eagerly anticipating. As December unfolds, the anticipation for a positive outcome on the Bitcoin ETF front is building. The SEC’s willingness to engage with various stakeholders reflects a newfound openness to exploring the potential benefits of such financial instruments. If the momentum continues, the market could witness a surge in activity, fueled by the approval of these ETF applications, providing a significant boost not only to Bitcoin but to the broader altcoin ecosystem. Zooming out to higher timeframes, the Bitcoin chart reveals a crucial resistance zone that has captured the attention of traders and investors alike. However, this period of consolidation offers a silver lining for altcoins. As Bitcoin takes a breather, altcoins are poised to continue their upward trends. The “buy the dip” strategy remains a compelling approach, presenting investors with attractive entry points as the market experiences temporary pullbacks.

Yet, seasoned investors understand the importance of maintaining a balanced approach. The cryptocurrency market, known for its volatility, can see rapid and substantial gains during bull cycles. However, it’s crucial to exercise caution and resist the temptation to sell positions entirely. The advice to never sell your position entirely during the early stages of a bull cycle is a reminder to remain flexible. Crypto projects have a history of rallying significantly during these periods, and those who maintain a long-term perspective may reap the benefits of sustained growth. Rather than succumbing to FOMO (fear of missing out) or market euphoria, investors are encouraged to assess their risk tolerance and make informed decisions that align with their financial goals. Final words: As the cryptocurrency market gears up for potential regulatory breakthroughs and Bitcoin’s consolidation phase, the prospects for an altseason are looking brighter than ever. The SEC’s engagement with Bitcoin ETF applicants, coupled with strategic investment approaches like “buy the dip” and maintaining flexibility in bullish cycles, paints an optimistic picture for crypto enthusiasts.

2023-11-17 22:40:00+00:00,Factors Hindering Bitcoin’s Breakthrough Beyond $37K,https://dailycoinpost.com/factors-hindering-bitcoins-breakthrough-beyond-37k/,"Bitcoin’s recent rollercoaster ride in the market, surging above $37,000 between November 10 and 12, only to retract and correct toward $35,000 on November 13, has left investors searching for answers. This abrupt movement triggered the liquidation of $121 million worth of long futures contracts, prompting a closer look at the underlying factors contributing to this downturn. Adding to the economic uncertainty, Moody’s rating agency lowered its outlook on U.S. credit to negative from stable on November 11. Surprisingly, this did not favorably sway investors toward Bitcoin or other alternative hedges. Instead, they sought refuge in short-term 5.25% fixed-income instruments. This shift in preference sheds light on the intricate dance between traditional and alternative investment options, impacting not only Bitcoin but also gold, which struggled to surpass $2,000 despite escalating debt levels and global economic challenges. Additionally, recent political developments, including U.S. government shutdown threats, could further influence Bitcoin’s performance. On November 14, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to keep the government operational through the holiday season, temporarily averting a fiscal crisis. However, this sets the stage for potential spending disputes in the coming year, including a provision to cut federal spending by 1% across the board in 2024 if no agreement is reached. The uncertainty introduced by these political maneuvers adds another layer of complexity to Bitcoin’s price dynamics. The outcome of these regulatory decisions could significantly impact the cryptocurrency market, regardless of the parties involved. Regulatory uncertainty introduces an element of risk that investors are keenly aware of, and this awareness may contribute to Bitcoin’s struggle to maintain its upward momentum. In essence, the drop in Bitcoin’s price after flirting with the $37,000 level cannot be attributed to a single event but rather to a complex interplay of economic data, global economic concerns, and regulatory developments. Investors, holding a keen eye on Bitcoin’s substantial $725 billion market capitalization, may be reassessing their positions in light of evolving market dynamics. As Bitcoin navigates these challenges, its ability to sustain momentum above $37,000 remains contingent on the resolution of these multifaceted factors. The coming weeks will likely provide more clarity on whether Bitcoin can overcome these hurdles and chart a path towards new highs or if further challenges lie ahead.

2023-04-27 09:10:52+00:00,Bitcoin Experiences Volatility: Settles at $29K After Rollercoaster Ride,https://dailycoinpost.com/bitcoin-experiences-volatility-settles-at-29k-after-rollercoaster-ride/,"Bitcoin went on a real rollercoaster yesterday by pumping to a local peak of $30,000 before dumping just as hard by $3,000 and going up again to $29,000. Bitcoin’s dominance keeps rising amid the latest price fluctuations. Most altcoins followed suit with similar volatility but have now calmed slightly in the red on a daily scale.  The primary cryptocurrency rarely sits quietly in terms of price movements, which is why yesterday’s rollercoaster was to be expected to an extent. This is because the asset stood in a tight range between $27,000 and $28,000 for several consecutive days. However, the trend changed when the bulls took charge and pushed BTC north hard. In a matter of a day, it skyrocketed to $30,000, leaving over $100 million in shorts liquidated. However, fake news emerged at this point claiming that wallets connected to the US government and Mt. Gox creditors have started disposing of their bitcoin. The consequences were felt immediately as BTC slumped by $3,000 to $27,200. As the reports were refuted, bitcoin went back on the offensive and recovered roughly $2,000. Bitcoin rebounded to pre-dump levels once the market realized that the cause of the sudden price drop was due to fake news. As soon as reports surfaced claiming that wallets linked to the US government and Mt. Gox were disposing of their bitcoin, panic ensued, and the market reacted by selling off. However, the refutation of these reports soon followed, and the market regained its confidence in Bitcoin. This led to a swift recovery of around $2,000, bringing the cryptocurrency back up to the $29,000 level. The incident served as a reminder of the importance of verifying information before making any hasty moves in the volatile cryptocurrency market. As of now, the cryptocurrency trades at around $29,000, which is still a minor increase compared to its price 24 hours ago. Its market cap still stands above $560 billion, and its dominance over the alts is close to 47% after gaining over 1% in the past few days. As it generally happens when BTC faces extreme volatility, so do the alternative coins. The run-up yesterday drove ETH from $1,800 to almost $2,000, but the subsequent rejection brought it back down to the former. Now that the dust has settled, at least momentarily, the second-largest crypto trades at $1,900. Cardano is the only larger-cap alt well in the green on a daily scale, having jumped by 3%. In contrast, Binance Coin, Ripple, Dogecoin, Polygon, Solana, Polkadot, Litecoin, and Shiba Inu are with minor losses. CRO, yesterday’s top performer following a partnership with Amazon, has retraced by over 5% now but still stands above $0.07. The total crypto market cap now remains at almost $1.2 trillion, despite going up and down by roughly $50 billion. The rollercoaster ride of Bitcoin’s price in response to the fake news about wallets connected to the US government and Mt. Gox creditors disposing of their bitcoin highlights the vulnerability of crypto markets to price manipulation. This incident shows how misinformation and rumors can cause sudden and significant price fluctuations in cryptocurrencies, leading to the loss of millions of dollars in a matter of hours. It also underscores the need for investors to conduct due diligence and verify information before making any trading decisions. Bitcoin Maximalist and Toxic to our banking and monetary system.

2023-04-22 10:56:49+00:00,Analyzing the Pattern of Negative Bitcoin Funding Rates Preceding Uptrends,https://dailycoinpost.com/analyzing-the-pattern-of-negative-bitcoin-funding-rates-preceding-uptrends/,"An analyst from CryptoQuant has uncovered a pattern in the Bitcoin funding rates that could signal upcoming uptrends. The funding rate is an indicator that measures the periodic fee that traders on the Bitcoin futures market are exchanging with each other. When the funding rate is negative, short contract holders are paying a premium to long holders to hold onto their positions, indicating that bearish sentiment is dominant in the market. Conversely, when the funding rate is positive, the longs are paying a fee to shorts, indicating a bullish market. The analyst has identified a pattern where the Bitcoin price starts rising when the metric is near zero within the negative zone. The analyst has marked the relevant portions of the trend in a graph showing the 72-hour moving average (MA) Bitcoin funding rate over the last few months. The chart reveals that whenever the funding rate has just turned negative, the price of Bitcoin has caught some upward momentum shortly after.  While there have been instances where the metric returned inside the positive zone not long after forming this pattern, the middle occurrence saw it go much deeper inside the negative territory first. It was only after the initial leg up in the price that the funding rate became positive again. This suggests that a neutral to negative value of the 72-hour MA Bitcoin funding rate has provided the proper ground for the price to rally during the last few months. Although the funding rate has had positive values recently, indicating that the total number of long positions has overwhelmed short positions, the metric has gradually decreased in the last few days. Despite this drawdown, the 72-hour Bitcoin funding rate is still significantly above the zero line. This means that if the pattern that has held during the last few months is to form again, more bearish positions would need to be opened on the market to nudge the balance towards the negative zone. In conclusion, the pattern discovered by the CryptoQuant analyst suggests that a neutral to negative value of the 72-hour MA Bitcoin funding rate could be a precursor to a price rally. If the price of Bitcoin starts to rise, these short contract holders could find themselves in trouble. This phenomenon is known as a short squeeze, and it can cause a rapid and significant increase in the price of Bitcoin. As short contract holders rush to close their positions, they may be willing to pay increasingly high prices to buy Bitcoin, further fueling the upward trend. In this pattern, bears can be trapped by their bearish positions and forced to close them out at a loss, contributing to the upward momentum of the market. However, while this pattern may provide insights into potential market movements, it’s important to approach trading with caution and to manage risk carefully. This pattern is not a guarantee of future price movements, and traders and investors should consider a range of factors and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions.

The article claims that “Bitcoin and Ethereum are volatile because supply is controlled by those who hold the coins.” GM from Great Britain ???????? where front page of the Sunday times biz & money section is a CBDC puff piece filled with misinformation about #Bitcoin   … pic.twitter.com/6o1217hWeP — SpartacusHODL ????????⚡???? (@Spartacus_HODL) April 9, 2023  This statement is not accurate  and it is misleading. While it is true that the supply of Bitcoin and Ethereum is limited, and that the market value of cryptocurrencies can be volatile, the volatility of these assets is primarily driven by demand and market forces, rather than the supply being controlled by those who hold the coins. Bitcoin and Ethereum operate on a decentralized network, where supply is programmed into the protocol and is not controlled by any single entity or individual. The total supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million, and the supply of Ethereum is limited by an annual cap on the amount of new tokens that can be created through mining. The limited supply of both cryptocurrencies is a deliberate design feature, intended to prevent inflation and maintain the value of the currency over time. However, the volatility of cryptocurrencies is primarily driven by factors such as market demand, regulatory changes, and media coverage, rather than the supply being controlled by those who hold the coins. For example, the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be affected by factors such as changes in government regulations, media coverage, and market speculation. It is also worth noting that the supply of cryptocurrencies can be influenced by mining, which is the process by which new coins are created and added to the blockchain. However, the mining process is open to anyone with the required computing power, and the rewards for mining are controlled by the protocol, rather than any single entity or individual. In summary, the claim made in the article that “Bitcoin and Ethereum are volatile because supply is controlled by those who hold the coins” is not accurate. While the supply of cryptocurrencies is limited, the market value of these assets is primarily driven by demand and market forces, rather than the supply being controlled by those who hold the coins.

2023-04-03 10:23:59+00:00,The Pros and Cons of Bitcoin as an Inflation Hedge,https://dailycoinpost.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-bitcoin-as-an-inflation-hedge/,"Bitcoin has been touted as a potential hedge against inflation, but like any investment, it comes with its own set of pros and cons. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits and drawbacks of using Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, so you can make an informed decision about whether to invest in it. Pros: Cons: It’s worth noting that the potential benefits of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge are not limited to individuals. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and lack of reliance on traditional financial institutions make it an attractive investment option for financially underserved populations. In many countries, hyperinflation and economic instability have left large portions of the population without access to traditional banking services. Bitcoin’s portability and ease of use offer a potential solution to this problem. However, it’s also important to acknowledge that Bitcoin is not without its drawbacks as a hedge against inflation. One concern is the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining. The process of verifying transactions on the Bitcoin network requires a significant amount of computational power, which has led to criticism about the energy consumption associated with Bitcoin mining. As environmental concerns continue to gain prominence in the public discourse, it remains to be seen how this will impact the long-term viability of Bitcoin as an investment option. Another potential drawback of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge is the risk of hacking and fraud. While Bitcoin transactions are secured by cryptography, the decentralized nature of the network means that there is no central authority to protect against theft or fraud. This has led to several high-profile hacks and thefts of Bitcoin, which can have a significant impact on the value of the currency. Overall, Bitcoin’s potential as an inflation hedge should be considered in the context of a wider range of investment options. While it does offer unique benefits in terms of its limited supply and decentralized nature, it is not without its risks. As with any investment, it’s important to do your research and consult with a financial advisor before making a decision.

2018-10-24 11:30:14+00:00,Free High Quality Bitcoin Whitepaper Poster,https://dailycoinpost.com/free-high-quality-bitcoin-whitepaper-poster/,"On October 31st, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’. Who would have thought that a whitepaper sent to a mailing list of cryptography enthusiasts would become a candidate to replace our central banks. In the middle of the 2008 financial crisis, Satoshi launched bitcoin, not only a payment system but a new concept of money that is decentralized, tamper-proof and censorship-free. During its short lifespan bitcoin has become the best-performing assets making a lot of overnight millionaires during the 2017 and 2021 bull run. Despite the price increase which is important, the most important thing is the philosophy that bitcoin transmits. People are becoming more informed about how the monetary system works and how the traditional financial system is unfair. Bankers that cause crisis get bailed out from the taxpayer money, or irresponsible governments that infinite print money cannibalizing the peoples’ savings. Venezuela is the biggest example with an increase of inflation by a 10 million percent increase. The centralization of Fiat money and the power of governments and bankers to control it is being used as a tool to suppress protests around the world against corrupt governments and an example of that is the situation in Lebanon. Many argue that bitcoin is a get-rich-quick scheme, but it is definitely a get-free-quick scheme. A payment system that you do not need a third party to give you permission to use your money. The invention of bitcoin, this nerd money, has exposed how dishonest is our monetary system. Bitcoin is transparent because everything is stored on a public ledger still the privacy is preserved because no personal data is sored in some database that can be hacked or sold like the traditional systems. The centralized traditional system is not transparent and personal details are frequently stolen or even sold from companies. Bitcoin is one of the greatest inventions of our century and would be cool to have the paper that started this revolution. Searching for a decent poster of the Bitcoin whitepaper I came to the conclusion that there is not a free one.
